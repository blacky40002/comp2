PREFACE


The peculiar construction of the first four stories in the present
collection will probably strike both reader and critic and seem to
call for some explanation, which I accordingly proceed to supply.

In the conventional “detective story” the interest is made to focus
on the question, “Who did it?” The identity of the criminal is a
secret that is jealously guarded up to the very end of the book, and
its disclosure forms the final climax.

This I have always regarded as somewhat of a mistake. In real life,
the identity of the criminal is a question of supreme importance for
practical reasons; but in fiction, where no such reasons exist, I
conceive the interest of the reader to be engaged chiefly by the
demonstration of unexpected consequences of simple actions, of
unsuspected causal connections, and by the evolution of an ordered
train of evidence from a mass of facts apparently incoherent and
unrelated. The reader’s curiosity is concerned not so much with the
question “Who did it?” as with the question “How was the discovery
achieved?” That is to say, the ingenious reader is interested more in
the intermediate action than in the ultimate result.

The offer by a popular author of a prize to the reader who should
identify the criminal in a certain “detective story,” exhibiting as
it did the opposite view, suggested to me an interesting question.

Would it be possible to write a detective story in which from the
outset the reader was taken entirely into the author’s confidence,
was made an actual witness of the crime and furnished with every fact
that could possibly be used in its detection? Would there be any
story left when the reader had all the facts? I believed that there
would; and as an experiment to test the justice of my belief, I wrote
“The Case of Oscar Brodski.” Here the usual conditions are reversed;
the reader knows everything, the detective knows nothing, and the
interest focuses on the unexpected significance of trivial
circumstances.

By excellent judges on both sides of the Atlantic--including the
editor of _Pearson’s Magazine_--this story was so far approved of
that I was invited to produce others of the same type.

Three more were written and are here included together with one of
the more orthodox character, so that the reader can judge of the
respective merits of the two methods of narration.

Nautical readers will observe that I have taken the liberty (for
obvious reasons connected with the law of libel) of planting a
screw-pile lighthouse on the Girdler Sand in place of the
light-vessel. I mention the matter to forestall criticism and save
readers the trouble of writing to point out the error.

THE CASE OF OSCAR BRODSKI


PART I

THE MECHANISM OF CRIME

A surprising amount of nonsense has been talked about conscience. On
the one hand remorse (or the “again-bite,” as certain scholars of
ultra-Teutonic leanings would prefer to call it); on the other hand
“an easy conscience”: these have been accepted as the determining
factors of happiness or the reverse.

Of course there is an element of truth in the “easy conscience” view,
but it begs the whole question. A particularly hardy conscience may
be quite easy under the most unfavourable conditions--conditions in
which the more feeble conscience might be severely afflicted with the
“again-bite.” And, then, it seems to be the fact that some fortunate
persons have no conscience at all; a negative gift that raises them
above the mental vicissitudes of the common herd of humanity.

Now, Silas Hickler was a case in point. No one, looking into his
cheerful, round face, beaming with benevolence and wreathed in
perpetual smiles, would have imagined him to be a criminal. Least of
all, his worthy, high-church house keeper, who was a witness to his
unvarying amiability, who constantly heard him carolling
light-heartedly about the house and noted his appreciative zest at
meal-times.

Yet it is a fact that Silas earned his modest, though comfortable,
income by the gentle art of burglary. A precarious trade and risky
withal, yet not so very hazardous if pursued with judgment and
moderation. And Silas was eminently a man of judgment. He worked
invariably alone. He kept his own counsel. No confederate had he to
turn King’s Evidence at a pinch; no one he knew would bounce off in a
fit of temper to Scotland Yard. Nor was he greedy and thriftless, as
most criminals are. His “scoops” were few and far between, carefully
planned, secretly executed, and the proceeds judiciously invested in
“weekly property.”

In early life Silas had been connected with the diamond industry, and
he still did a little rather irregular dealing. In the trade he was
suspected of transactions with I.D.B.’s, and one or two indiscreet
dealers had gone so far as to whisper the ominous word “fence.” But
Silas Smiled a benevolent smile and went his way. He knew what he
knew, and his clients in Amsterdam were not inquisitive.

Such was Silas Hickler. As he strolled round his garden in the dusk
of an October evening, he seemed the very type of modest,
middle-class prosperity. He was dressed in the travelling suit that
he wore on his little continental trips; his bag was packed and stood
in readiness on the sitting room sofa. A parcel of diamonds
(purchased honestly, though without impertinent questions, at
Southampton) was in the inside pocket of his waistcoat, and another
more valuable parcel was stowed in a cavity in the heel of his right
boot. In an hour and a half it would be time for him to set out to
catch the boat train at the junction; meanwhile there was nothing to
do but to stroll round the fading garden and consider how he should
invest the proceeds of the impending deal. His housekeeper had gone
over to Welham for the week’s shopping, and would probably not be
back until eleven o’clock. He was alone in the premises and just a
trifle dull.

He was about to turn into the house when his ear caught the sound of
footsteps on the unmade road that passed the end of the garden. He
paused and listened. There was no other dwelling near, and the road
led nowhere, fading away into the waste land beyond the house. Could
this be a visitor? It seemed unlikely, for visitors were few at Silas
Hickler’s house. Meanwhile the footsteps continued to approach,
ringing out with increasing loudness on the hard, stony path.

Silas strolled down to the gate, and, leaning on it, looked out with
some curiosity. Presently a glow of light showed him the face of a
man, apparently lighting his pipe; then a dim figure detached itself
from the enveloping gloom, advanced towards him and halted opposite
the garden. The stranger removed a cigarette from his mouth and,
blowing out a cloud of smoke, asked--

“Can you tell me if this road will take me to Badsham Junction?”

“No,” replied Hickler, “but there is a footpath farther on that leads
to the station.”

“Footpath!” growled the stranger. “I’ve had enough of footpaths. I
came down from town to Catley intending to walk across to the
junction. I started along the road, and then some fool directed me to
a short cut, with the result that I have been blundering about in the
dark for the last half-hour. My sight isn’t very good, you know,” he
added.

“What train do you want to catch?” asked Hickler.

“Seven fifty-eight,” was the reply.

“I am going to catch that train myself,” said Silas, “but I shan’t be
starting for another hour. The station is only three-quarters of a
mile from here. If you like to come in and take a rest, we can walk
down together and then you’ll be sure of not missing your way.”

“It’s very good of you,” said the stranger, peering, with spectacled
eyes, at the dark house, “but--I think----”

“Might as well wait here as at the station,” said Silas in his genial
way, holding the gate open, and the stranger, after a momentary
hesitation, entered and, flinging away his cigarette, followed him to
the door of the cottage.

The sitting-room was in darkness, save for the dull glow of the
expiring fire, but, entering before his guest, Silas applied a match
to the lamp that hung from the ceiling. As the flame leaped up,
flooding the little interior with light, the two men regarded one
another with mutual curiosity.

“Brodski, by Jingo!” was Hickler’s silent commentary, as he looked at
his guest. “Doesn’t know me, evidently--wouldn’t, of course, after
all these years and with his bad eyesight. Take a seat, sir,” he
added aloud. “Will you join me in a little refreshment to while away
the time?”

Brodski murmured an indistinct acceptance, and, as his host turned to
open a cupboard, he deposited his hat (a hard, grey felt) on a chair
in a corner, placed his bag on the edge of the table, resting his
umbrella against it, and sat down in a small arm-chair.

“Have a biscuit?” said Hickler, as he placed a whisky-bottle on the
table together with a couple of his best star-pattern tumblers and a
siphon.

“Thanks, I think I will,” said Brodski. “The railway journey and all
this confounded tramping about, you know----”

“Yes,” agreed Silas. “Doesn’t do to start with an empty stomach. Hope
you don’t mind oat-cakes; I see they’re the only biscuits I have.”

Brodski hastened to assure him that oat-cakes were his special and
peculiar fancy; and in confirmation, having mixed himself a stiff
jorum, he fell to upon the biscuits with evident gusto.

Brodski was a deliberate feeder, and at present appeared to be
somewhat sharp set. His measured munching being unfavourable to
conversation, most of the talking fell to Silas; and, for once, that
genial transgressor found the task embarrassing. The natural thing
would have been to discuss his guest’s destination and perhaps the
object of his journey; but this was precisely what Hickler avoided
doing. For he knew both, and instinct told him to keep his knowledge
to himself.

Brodski was a diamond merchant of considerable reputation, and in a
large way of business. He bought stones principally in the rough, and
of these he was a most excellent judge. His fancy was for stones of
somewhat unusual size and value, and it was well known to be his
custom, when he had accumulated a sufficient stock, to carry them
himself to Amsterdam and supervise the cutting of the rough stones.
Of this Hickler was aware, and he had no doubt that Brodski was now
starting on one of his periodical excursions; that somewhere in the
recesses of his rather shabby clothing was concealed a paper packet
possibly worth several thousand pounds.

Brodski sat by the table munching monotonously and talking little.
Hickler sat opposite him, talking nervously and rather wildly at
times, and watching his guest with a growing fascination. Precious
stones, and especially diamonds, were Hickler’s specialty. “Hard
stuff”--silver plate--he avoided entirely; gold, excepting in the
form of specie, he seldom touched; but stones, of which he could
carry off a whole consignment in the heel of his boot and dispose of
with absolute safety, formed the staple of his industry. And here was
a man sitting opposite him with a parcel in his pocket containing the
equivalent of a dozen of his most successful “scoops”; stones worth
perhaps---- Here he pulled himself up short and began to talk
rapidly, though without much coherence. For, even as he talked, other
words, formed subconsciously, seemed to insinuate themselves into the
interstices of the sentences, and to carry on a parallel train of
thought.

“Gets chilly in the evenings now, doesn’t it?” said Hickler.

“It does indeed,” Brodski agreed, and then resumed his slow munching,
breathing audibly through his nose.

“Five thousand at least,” the subconscious train of thought resumed;
“probably six or seven, perhaps ten.” Silas fidgeted in his chair and
endeavoured to concentrate his ideas on some topic of interest. He
was growing disagreeably conscious of a new and unfamiliar state of
mind.

“Do you take any interest in gardening?” he asked. Next to diamonds
and weekly “property,” his besetting weakness was fuchsias.

Brodski chuckled sourly. “Hatton Garden is the nearest approach----”
He broke off suddenly, and then added, “I am a Londoner, you know.”

The abrupt break in the sentence was not unnoticed by Silas, nor had
he any difficulty in interpreting it. A man who carries untold wealth
upon his person must needs be wary in his speech.

“Yes,” he answered absently, “it’s hardly a Londoner’s hobby.” And
then, half consciously, he began a rapid calculation. Put it at five
thousand pounds. What would that represent in weekly property? His
last set of houses had cost two hundred and fifty pounds apiece, and
he had let them at ten shillings and sixpence a week. At that rate,
five thousand pounds represented twenty houses at ten and sixpence a
week--say ten pounds a week--one pound eight shillings a day--five
hundred and twenty pounds a year--for life. It was a competency.
Added to what he already had, it was wealth. With that income he
could fling the tools of his trade into the river and live out the
remainder of his life in comfort and security.

He glanced furtively at his guest across the table, and then looked
away quickly as he felt stirring within him an impulse the nature of
which he could not mistake. This must be put an end to. Crimes
against the person he had always looked upon as sheer insanity. There
was, it is true, that little affair of the Weybridge policeman, but
that was unforeseen and unavoidable, and it was the constable’s doing
after all. And there was the old housekeeper at Epsom, too, but, of
course, if the old idiot would shriek in that insane fashion--well,
it was an accident, very regrettable, to be sure, and no one could be
more sorry for the mishap than himself. But deliberate
homicide!--robbery from the person! It was the act of a stark lunatic.

Of course, if he had happened to be that sort of person, here was the
opportunity of a lifetime. The immense booty, the empty house, the
solitary neighbourhood, away from the main road and from other
habitations; the time, the darkness--but, of course, there was the
body to be thought of; that was always the difficulty. What to do
with the body---- Here he caught the shriek of the up express,
rounding the curve in the line that ran past the waste land at the
back of the house. The sound started a new train of thought, and, as
he followed it out, his eyes fixed themselves on the unconscious and
taciturn Brodski, as he sat thoughtfully sipping his whisky. At
length, averting his gaze with an effort, he rose suddenly from his
chair and turned to look at the clock on the mantelpiece, spreading
out his hands before the dying fire. A tumult of strange sensations
warned him to leave the house. He shivered slightly, though he was
rather hot than chilly, and, turning his head, looked at the door.

“Seems to be a confounded draught,” he said, with another slight
shiver; “did I shut the door properly, I wonder?” He strode across
the room and, opening the door wide, looked out into the dark garden.
A desire, sudden and urgent, had come over him to get out into the
open air, to be on the road and have done with this madness that was
knocking at the door of his brain.

“I wonder if it is worth while to start yet,” he said, with a
yearning glance at the murky, starless sky.

Brodski roused himself and looked round. “Is your clock right?” he
asked.

Silas reluctantly admitted that it was.

“How long will it take us to walk to the station?” inquired Brodski.

“Oh, about twenty-five minutes to half-an-hour,” replied Silas,
unconsciously exaggerating the distance.

“Well,” said Brodski, “we’ve got more than an hour yet, and it’s more
comfortable here than hanging about the station. I don’t see the use
of starting before we need.”

“No; of course not,” Silas agreed. A wave of strange emotion,
half-regretful, half-triumphant, surged through his brain. For some
moments he remained standing on the threshold, looking out dreamily
into the night. Then he softly closed the door; and, seemingly
without the exercise of his volition, the key turned noiselessly in
the lock.

He returned to his chair and tried to open a conversation with the
taciturn Brodski, but the words came faltering and disjointed. He
felt his face growing hot, his brain full and intense, and there was
a faint, high-pitched singing in his ears. He was conscious of
watching his guest with a new and fearful interest, and, by sheer
force of will, turned away his eyes; only to find them a moment later
involuntarily returning to fix the unconscious man with yet more
horrible intensity. And ever through his mind walked, like a dreadful
procession, the thoughts of what that other man--the man of blood and
violence--would do in these circumstances. Detail by detail the
hideous synthesis fitted together the parts of the imagined crime,
and arranged them in due sequence until they formed a succession of
events, rational, connected and coherent.

He rose uneasily from his chair, with his eyes still riveted upon his
guest. He could not sit any longer opposite that man with his hidden
store of precious gems. The impulse that he recognized with fear and
wonder was growing more ungovernable from moment to moment. If he
stayed it would presently overpower him, and then---- He shrank with
horror from the dreadful thought, but his fingers itched to handle
the diamonds. For Silas was, after all, a criminal by nature and
habit. He was a beast of prey. His livelihood had never been earned;
it had been taken by stealth or, if necessary, by force. His
instincts were predacious, and the proximity of unguarded valuables
suggested to him, as a logical consequence, their abstraction or
seizure. His unwillingness to let these diamonds go away beyond his
reach was fast becoming overwhelming.

But he would make one more effort to escape. He would keep out of
Brodski’s actual presence until the moment for starting came.

“If you’ll excuse me,” he said, “I will go and put on a thicker pair
of boots. After all this dry weather we may get a change, and damp
feet are very uncomfortable when you are travelling.”

“Yes; dangerous too,” agreed Brodski.

Silas walked through into the adjoining kitchen, where, by the light
of the little lamp that was burning there, he had seen his stout,
country boots placed, cleaned and in readiness, and sat down upon a
chair to make the change. He did not, of course, intend to wear the
country boots, for the diamonds were concealed in those he had on.
But he would make the change and then alter his mind; it would all
help to pass the time. He took a deep breath. It was a relief, at any
rate, to be out of that room. Perhaps if he stayed away, the
temptation would pass. Brodski would go on his way--he wished that he
was going alone--and the danger would be over--at least--and the
opportunity would have gone--the diamonds----

He looked up as he slowly unlaced his boot. From where he sat he
could see Brodski sitting by the table with his back towards the
kitchen door. He had finished eating, now, and was composedly rolling
a cigarette. Silas breathed heavily, and, slipping off his boot, sat
for a while motionless, gazing steadily at the other man’s back. Then
he unlaced the other boot, still staring abstractedly at his
unconscious guest, drew it off, and laid it very quietly on the floor.

Brodski calmly finished rolling his cigarette, licked the paper, put
away his pouch, and, having dusted the crumbs of tobacco from his
knees, began to search his pockets for a match. Suddenly, yielding to
an uncontrollable impulse, Silas stood up and began stealthily to
creep along the passage to the sitting-room. Not a sound came from
his stockinged feet. Silently as a cat he stole forward, breathing
softly with parted lips, until he stood at the threshold of the room.
His face flushed duskily, his eyes, wide and staring, glittered in
the lamplight, and the racing blood hummed in his ears.

Brodski struck a match--Silas noted that it was a wooden
vesta--lighted his cigarette, blew out the match and flung it into
the fender. Then he replaced the box in his pocket and commenced to
smoke.

Slowly and without a sound Silas crept forward into the room, step by
step, with catlike stealthiness, until he stood close behind
Brodski’s chair--so close that he had to turn his head that his
breath might not stir the hair upon the other man’s head. So, for
half-a-minute, he stood motionless, like a symbolical statue of
Murder, glaring down with horrible, glittering eyes upon the
unconscious diamond merchant, while his quick breath passed without a
sound through his open mouth and his fingers writhed slowly like the
tentacles of a giant hydra. And then, as noiselessly as ever, he
backed away to the door, turned quickly and walked back into the
kitchen.

He drew a deep breath. It had been a near thing. Brodski’s life had
hung upon a thread. For it had been so easy. Indeed, if he had
happened, as he stood behind the man’s chair, to have a weapon--a
hammer, for instance, or even a stone----

He glanced round the kitchen and his eyes lighted on a bar that had
been left by the workmen who had put up the new greenhouse. It was an
odd piece cut off from a square, wrought-iron stanchion, and was
about a foot long and perhaps three-quarters of an inch thick. Now,
if he had had that in his hand a minute ago----

He picked the bar up, balanced it in his hand and swung it round his
head. A formidable weapon this: silent, too. And it fitted the plan
that had passed through his brain. Bah! He had better put the thing
down.

But he did not. He stepped over to the door and looked again at
Brodski, sitting, as before, meditatively smoking, with his back
towards the kitchen.

Suddenly a change came over Silas. His face flushed, the veins of his
neck stood out and a sullen scowl settled on his face. He drew out
his watch, glanced at it earnestly and replaced it. Then he strode
swiftly but silently along the passage into the sitting-room.

A pace away from his victim’s chair he halted and took deliberate
aim. The bar swung aloft, but not without some faint rustle of
movement, for Brodski looked round quickly even as the iron whistled
through the air. The movement disturbed the murderer’s aim, and the
bar glanced off his victim’s head, making only a trifling wound.
Brodski sprang up with a tremulous, bleating cry, and clutched his
assailant’s arms with the tenacity of mortal terror.

Then began a terrible struggle, as the two men, locked in a deadly
embrace, swayed to and fro and trampled backwards and forwards. The
chair was overturned, an empty glass swept from the table and, with
Brodski’s spectacles, crushed beneath stamping feet. And thrice that
dreadful, pitiful, bleating cry rang out into the night, filling
Silas, despite his murderous frenzy, with terror lest some chance
wayfarer should hear it. Gathering his great strength for a final
effort, he forced his victim backwards onto the table and, snatching
up a corner of the tablecloth, thrust it into his face and crammed it
into his mouth as it opened to utter another shriek. And thus they
remained for a full two minutes, almost motionless, like some
dreadful group of tragic allegory. Then, when the last faint
twitchings had died away, Silas relaxed his grasp and let the limp
body slip softly onto the floor.

It was over. For good or for evil, the thing was done. Silas stood
up, breathing heavily, and, as he wiped the sweat from his face, he
looked at the clock. The hands stood at one minute to seven. The
whole thing had taken a little over three minutes. He had nearly an
hour in which to finish his task. The goods train that entered into
his scheme came by at twenty minutes past, and it was only three
hundred yards to the line. Still, he must not waste time. He was now
quite composed, and only disturbed by the thought that Brodski’s
cries might have been heard. If no one had heard them it was all
plain sailing.

He stooped, and, gently disengaging the tablecloth from the dead
man’s teeth, began a careful search of his pockets. He was not long
finding what he sought, and, as he pinched the paper packet and felt
the little hard bodies grating on one another inside, his faint
regrets for what had happened were swallowed up in
self-congratulations.

He now set about his task with business-like briskness and an
attentive eye on the clock. A few large drops of blood had fallen on
the tablecloth, and there was a small bloody smear on the carpet by
the dead man’s head. Silas fetched from the kitchen some water, a
nail-brush and a dry cloth, and, having washed out the stains from
the table-cover--not forgetting the deal table-top underneath--and
cleaned away the smear from the carpet and rubbed the damp places
dry, he slipped a sheet of paper under the head of the corpse to
prevent further contamination. Then he set the table cloth straight,
stood the chair upright, laid the broken spectacles on the table and
picked up the cigarette, which had been trodden flat in the struggle,
and flung it under the grate. Then there was the broken glass, which
he swept up into a dust-pan. Part of it was the remains of the
shattered tumbler, and the rest the fragments of the broken
spectacles. He turned it out onto a sheet of paper and looked it over
carefully, picking out the larger recognizable pieces of the
spectacle-glasses and putting them aside on a separate slip of paper,
together with a sprinkling of the minute fragments. The remainder he
shot back into the dust-pan and, having hurriedly put on his boots,
carried it out to the rubbish-heap at the back of the house.

It was now time to start. Hastily cutting off a length of string from
his string-box--for Silas was an orderly man and despised the
oddments of string with which many people make shift--he tied it to
the dead man’s bag and umbrella and slung them from his shoulder.
Then he folded up the paper of broken glass, and, slipping it and the
spectacles into his pocket, picked up the body and threw it over his
shoulder. Brodski was a small, spare man, weighing not more than nine
stone; not a very formidable burden for a big, athletic man like
Silas.

The night was intensely dark, and, when Silas looked out of the back
gate over the waste land that stretched from his house to the
railway, he could hardly see twenty yards ahead. After listening
cautiously and hearing no sound, he went out, shut the gate softly
behind him and set forth at a good pace, though carefully, over the
broken ground. His progress was not as silent as he could have wished
for, though the scanty turf that covered the gravelly land was thick
enough to deaden his footfalls, the swinging bag and umbrella made an
irritating noise; indeed, his movements were more hampered by them
than by the weightier burden.

The distance to the line was about three hundred yards. Ordinarily he
would have walked it in from three to four minutes, but now, going
cautiously with his burden and stopping now and again to listen, it
took him just six minutes to reach the three-bar fence that separated
the waste land from the railway. Arrived here he halted for a moment
and once more listened attentively, peering into the darkness on all
sides. Not a living creature was to be seen or heard in this desolate
spot, but far away, the shriek of an engine’s whistle warned him to
hasten.

Lifting the corpse easily over the fence, he carried it a few yards
farther to a point where the line curved sharply. Here he laid it
face downwards, with the neck over the near rail. Drawing out his
pocket-knife, he cut through the knot that fastened the umbrella to
the string and also secured the bag; and when he had flung the bag
and umbrella on the track beside the body, he carefully pocketed the
string, excepting the little loop that had fallen to the ground when
the knot was cut.

The quick snort and clanking rumble of an approaching goods train
began now to be clearly audible. Rapidly, Silas drew from his pockets
the battered spectacles and the packet of broken glass. The former he
threw down by the dead man’s head, and then, emptying the packet into
his hand, sprinkled the fragments of glass around the spectacles.

He was none too soon. Already the quick, laboured puffing of the
engine sounded close at hand. His impulse was to stay and watch; to
witness the final catastrophe that should convert the murder into an
accident or suicide. But it was hardly safe: it would be better that
he should not be near lest he should not be able to get away without
being seen. Hastily he climbed back over the fence and strode away
across the rough fields, while the train came snorting and clattering
towards the curve.

He had nearly reached his back gate when a sound from the line
brought him to a sudden halt; it was a prolonged whistle accompanied
by the groan of brakes and the loud clank of colliding trucks. The
snorting of the engine had ceased and was replaced by the penetrating
hiss of escaping steam.

The train had stopped!

For one brief moment Silas stood with bated breath and mouth agape
like one petrified; then he strode forward quickly to the gate, and,
letting himself in, silently slid the bolt. He was undeniably
alarmed. What could have happened on the line? It was practically
certain that the body had been seen; but what was happening now? and
would they come to the house? He entered the kitchen, and having
paused again to listen--for somebody might come and knock at the door
at any moment--he walked through the sitting-room and looked round.
All seemed in order there. There was the bar, though, lying where he
had dropped it in the scuffle. He picked it up and held it under the
lamp. There was no blood on it; only one or two hairs. Somewhat
absently he wiped it with the table-cover, and then, running out
through the kitchen into the back garden, dropped it over the wall
into a bed of nettles. Not that there was any thing incriminating in
the bar, but, since he had used it as a weapon, it had somehow
acquired a sinister aspect to his eye.

He now felt that it would be well to start for the station at once.
It was not time yet, for it was barely twenty-five minutes past
seven; but he did not wish to be found in the house if any one should
come. His soft hat was on the sofa with his bag, to which his
umbrella was strapped. He put on the hat, caught up the bag and
stepped over to the door; then he came back to turn down the lamp.
And it was at this moment, when he stood with his hand raised to the
burner, that his eyes, travelling by chance into the dim corner of
the room, lighted on Brodski’s grey felt hat, reposing on the chair
where the dead man had placed it when he entered the house.

Silas stood for a few moments as if petrified, with the chilly sweat
of mortal fear standing in beads upon his forehead. Another instant
and he would have turned the lamp down and gone on his way; and then
he strode over to the chair, snatched up the hat and looked inside
it. Yes, there was the name, “Oscar Brodski,” written plainly on the
lining. If he had gone away, leaving it to be discovered, he would
have been lost; indeed, even now, if a search-party should come to
the house, it was enough to send him to the gallows.

His limbs shook with horror at the thought, but in spite of his panic
he did not lose his self-possession. Darting through into the
kitchen, he grabbed up a handful of the dry brush-wood that was kept
for lighting fires and carried it to the sitting-room grate where he
thrust it on the extinct, but still hot, embers, and crumpling up the
paper that he had placed under Brodski’s head--on which paper he now
noticed, for the first time, a minute bloody smear--he poked it in
under the wood, and striking a wax match, set light to it. As the
wood flared up, he hacked at the hat with his pocket knife and threw
the ragged strips into the blaze.

And all the while his heart was thumping and his hands a-tremble with
the dread of discovery. The fragments of felt were far from
inflammable, tending rather to fuse into cindery masses that smoked
and smouldered than to burn away into actual ash. Moreover, to his
dismay, they emitted a powerful resinous stench mixed with the odour
of burning hair, so that he had to open the kitchen window (since he
dared not unlock the front door) to disperse the reek. And still, as
he fed the fire with small cut fragments, he strained his ears to
catch, above the crackling of the wood, the sound of the dreaded
footsteps, the knock on the door that should be as the summons of
Fate.

The time, too, was speeding on. Twenty-one minutes to eight! In a few
minutes more he must set out or he would miss the train. He dropped
the dismembered hat-brim on the blazing wood and ran upstairs to open
a window, since he must close that in the kitchen before he left.
When he came back, the brim had already curled up into a black,
clinkery mass that bubbled and hissed as the fat, pungent smoke rose
from it sluggishly to the chimney.

Nineteen minutes to eight! It was time to start. He took up the poker
and carefully beat the cinders into small particles, stirring them
into the glowing embers of the wood and coal. There was nothing
unusual in the appearance of the grate. It was his constant custom to
burn letters and other discarded articles in the sitting room fire:
his housekeeper would notice nothing out of the common. Indeed, the
cinders would probably be reduced to ashes before she returned. He
had been careful to notice that there were no metallic fittings of
any kind in the hat, which might have escaped burning.

Once more he picked up his bag, took a last look round, turned down
the lamp and, unlocking the door, held it open for a few moments.
Then he went out, locked the door, pocketed the key (of which his
housekeeper had a duplicate) and set off at a brisk pace for the
station.

He arrived in good time after all, and, having taken his ticket,
strolled through onto the platform. The train was not yet signalled,
but there seemed to be an unusual stir in the place. The passengers
were collected in a group at one end of the platform, and were all
looking in one direction down the line; and, even as he walked
towards them, with a certain tremulous, nauseating curiosity, two men
emerged from the darkness and ascended the slope to the platform,
carrying a stretcher covered with a tarpaulin. The passengers parted
to let the bearers pass, turning fascinated eyes upon the shape that
showed faintly through the rough pall; and, when the stretcher had
been borne into the lamp-room, they fixed their attention upon a
porter who followed carrying a handbag and an umbrella.

Suddenly one of the passengers started forward with an exclamation.

“Is that his umbrella?” he demanded.

“Yes, sir,” answered the porter, stopping and holding it out for the
speaker’s inspection.

“My God!” ejaculated the passenger; then, turning sharply to a tall
man who stood close by, he said excitedly: “That’s Brodski’s
umbrella. I could swear to it. You remember Brodski?” The tall man
nodded, and the passenger, turning once more to the porter, said: “I
identify that umbrella. It belongs to a gentleman named Brodski. If
you look in his hat you will see his name written in it. He always
writes his name in his hat.”

“We haven’t found his hat yet,” said the porter; “but here is the
station-master coming up the line.” He awaited the arrival of his
superior and then announced: “This gentleman, sir, has identified the
umbrella.”

“Oh,” said the station-master, “you recognize the umbrella, sir, do
you? Then perhaps you would step into the lamp-room and see if you
can identify the body.”

“Is it--is he--very much injured?” the passenger asked tremulously.

“Well, yes,” was the reply. “You see, the engine and six of the
trucks went over him before they could stop the train. Took his head
clean off, in fact.”

“Shocking! shocking!” gasped the passenger. “I think, if you don’t
mind--I’d--I’d rather not. You don’t think it’s necessary, doctor, do
you?”

“Yes, I do,” replied the tall man. “Early identification may be of
the first importance.”

“Then I suppose I must,” said the passenger.

Very reluctantly he allowed himself to be conducted by the
station-master to the lamp-room, as the clang of the bell announced
the approaching train. Silas Hickler followed and took his stand with
the expectant crowd outside the closed door. In a few moments the
passenger burst out, pale and awe-stricken, and rushed up to his tall
friend. “It is!” he exclaimed breathlessly. “It’s Brodski! Poor old
Brodski! Horrible! horrible! He was to have met me here and come on
with me to Amsterdam.”

“Had he any--merchandize about him?” the tall man asked; and Silas
strained his ears to catch the reply.

“He had some stones, no doubt, but I don’t know what. His clerk will
know, of course. By the way, doctor, could you watch the case for me?
Just to be sure it was really an accident or--you know what. We were
old friends, you know, fellow townsmen, too; we were both born in
Warsaw. I’d like you to give an eye to the case.”

“Very well,” said the other. “I will satisfy myself that--there is
nothing more than appears, and let you have a report. Will that do?”

“Thank you. It’s excessively good of you, doctor. Ah! here comes the
train. I hope it won’t inconvenience you to stay and see to this
matter.”

“Not in the least,” replied the doctor. “We are not due at Warmington
until tomorrow afternoon, and I expect we can find out all that is
necessary to know before that.”

Silas looked long and curiously at the tall, imposing man who was, as
it were, taking his seat at the chess board, to play against him for
his life. A formidable antagonist he looked, with his keen,
thoughtful face, so resolute and calm. As Silas stepped into his
carriage he thought with deep discomfort of Brodski’s hat, and hoped
that he had made no other oversight.


PART II

THE MECHANISM OF DETECTION

(_Related by Christopher Jervis, M.D._)

The singular circumstances that attended the death of Mr. Oscar
Brodski, the well-known diamond merchant of Hatton Garden,
illustrated very forcibly the importance of one or two points in
medico-legal practice which Thorndyke was accustomed to insist were
not sufficiently appreciated. What those points were, I shall leave
my friend and teacher to state at the proper place; and meanwhile, as
the case is in the highest degree instructive, I shall record the
incidents in the order of their occurrence.

The dusk of an October evening was closing in as Thorndyke and I, the
sole occupants of a smoking compartment, found ourselves approaching
the little station of Ludham; and, as the train slowed down, we
peered out at the knot of country people who were waiting on the
platform. Suddenly Thorndyke exclaimed in a tone of surprise: “Why,
that is surely Boscovitch!” and almost at the same moment a brisk,
excitable little man darted at the door of our compartment and
literally tumbled in.

“I hope I don’t intrude on this learned conclave,” he said, shaking
hands genially and banging his Gladstone with impulsive violence into
the rack; “but I saw your faces at the window, and naturally jumped
at the chance of such pleasant companionship.”

“You are very flattering,” said Thorndyke; “so flattering that you
leave us nothing to say. But what in the name of fortune are you
doing at--what’s the name of the place--Ludham?”

“My brother has a little place a mile or so from here, and I have
been spending a couple of days with him,” Mr. Boscovitch explained.
“I shall change at Badsham Junction and catch the boat train for
Amsterdam. But whither are you two bound? I see you have your
mysterious little green box up on the hat-rack, so I infer that you
are on some romantic quest, eh? Going to unravel some dark and
intricate crime?”

“No,” replied Thorndyke. “We are bound for Warmington on a quite
prosaic errand. I am instructed to watch the proceedings at an
inquest there to-morrow on behalf of the Griffin Life Insurance
Office, and we are travelling down to-night as it is rather a
cross-country journey.”

“But why the box of magic?” asked Boscovitch, glancing up at the
hat-rack.

“I never go away from home without it,” answered Thorndyke. “One
never knows what may turn up; the trouble of carrying it is small
when set off against the comfort of having appliances at hand in an
emergency.”

Boscovitch continued to stare up at the little square case covered
with Willesden canvas. Presently he remarked: “I often used to wonder
what you had in it when you were down at Chelmsford in connection
with that bank murder--what an amazing case that was, by the way, and
didn’t your methods of research astonish the police!” As he still
looked up wistfully at the case, Thorndyke good-naturedly lifted it
down and unlocked it. As a matter of fact he was rather proud of his
“portable laboratory,” and certainly it was a triumph of
condensation, for, small as it was--only a foot square by four inches
deep--it contained a fairly complete outfit for a preliminary
investigation.

“Wonderful!” exclaimed Boscovitch, when the case lay open before him,
displaying its rows of little reagent bottles, tiny test-tubes,
diminutive spirit-lamp, dwarf microscope and assorted instruments on
the same Lilliputian scale; “it’s like a doll’s house--everything
looks as if it was seen through the wrong end of a telescope. But are
these tiny things really efficient? That microscope now----”

“Perfectly efficient at low and moderate magnifications,” said
Thorndyke. “It looks like a toy, but it isn’t one; the lenses are the
best that can be had. Of course a full-sized instrument would be
infinitely more convenient--but I shouldn’t have it with me, and
should have to make shift with a pocket-lens. And so with the rest of
the under-sized appliances; they are the alternative to no
appliances.”

Boscovitch pored over the case and its contents, fingering the
instruments delicately and asking questions innumerable about their
uses; indeed, his curiosity was but half appeased when, half-an-hour
later, the train began to slow down.

“By Jove!” he exclaimed, starting up and seizing his bag, “here we
are at the junction already. You change here too, don’t you?”

“Yes,” replied Thorndyke. “We take the branch train on to Warmington.”

As we stepped out onto the platform, we became aware that something
unusual was happening or had happened. All the passengers and most of
the porters and supernumeraries were gathered at one end of the
station, and all were looking intently into the darkness down the
line.

“Anything wrong?” asked Mr. Boscovitch, addressing the
station-inspector.

“Yes, sir,” the official replied; “a man has been run over by the
goods train about a mile down the line. The station master has gone
down with a stretcher to bring him in, and I expect that is his
lantern that you see coming this way.”

As we stood watching the dancing light grow momentarily brighter,
flashing fitful reflections from the burnished rails, a man came out
of the booking-office and joined the group of onlookers. He attracted
my attention, as I afterwards remembered, for two reasons: in the
first place his round, jolly face was excessively pale and bore a
strained and wild expression, and, in the second, though he stared
into the darkness with eager curiosity he asked no questions.

The swinging lantern continued to approach, and then suddenly two men
came into sight bearing a stretcher covered with a tarpaulin, through
which the shape of a human figure was dimly discernible. They
ascended the slope to the platform, and proceeded with their burden
to the lamp-room, when the inquisitive gaze of the passengers was
transferred to a porter who followed carrying a handbag and umbrella
and to the station-master who brought up the rear with his lantern.

As the porter passed, Mr. Boscovitch started forward with sudden
excitement.

“Is that his umbrella?” he asked.

“Yes, sir,” answered the porter, stopping and holding it out for the
speaker’s inspection.

“My God!” ejaculated Boscovitch; then, turning sharply to Thorndyke,
he exclaimed: “That’s Brodski’s umbrella. I could swear to it. You
remember Brodski?”

Thorndyke nodded, and Boscovitch, turning once more to the porter,
said: “I identify that umbrella. It belongs to a gentleman named
Brodski. If you look in his hat, you will see his name written in it.
He always writes his name in his hat.”

“We haven’t found his hat yet,” said the porter; “but here is the
station-master.” He turned to his superior and announced: “This
gentleman, sir, has identified the umbrella.”

“Oh,” said the station-master, “you recognize the umbrella, sir, do
you? Then perhaps you would step into the lamp-room and see if you
can identify the body.”

Mr. Boscovitch recoiled with a look of alarm. “Is it--is he--very
much injured?” he asked nervously.

“Well, yes,” was the reply. “You see, the engine and six of the
trucks went over him before they could stop the train. Took his head
clean off, in fact.”

“Shocking! shocking!” gasped Boscovitch. “I think--if you don’t
mind--I’d--I’d rather not. You don’t think it necessary, doctor, do
you?”

“Yes, I do,” replied Thorndyke. “Early identification may be of the
first importance.”

“Then I suppose I must,” said Boscovitch; and, with extreme
reluctance, he followed the station-master to the lamp-room, as the
loud ringing of the bell announced the approach of the boat train.
His inspection must have been of the briefest, for, in a few moments,
he burst out, pale and awe-stricken, and rushed up to Thorndyke.

“It is!” he exclaimed breathlessly. “It’s Brodski! Poor old Brodski!
Horrible! horrible! He was to have met me here and come on with me to
Amsterdam.”

“Had he any--merchandize about him?” Thorndyke asked; and, as he
spoke, the stranger whom I had previously noticed edged up closer as
if to catch the reply.

“He had some stones, no doubt,” answered Boscovitch, “but I don’t
know what they were. His clerk will know, of course. By the way,
doctor, could you watch the case for me? Just to be sure it was
really an accident or--you know what. We were old friends, you know,
fellow townsmen, too; we were both born in Warsaw. I’d like you to
give an eye to the case.”

“Very well,” said Thorndyke. “I will satisfy myself that there is
nothing more than appears, and let you have a report. Will that do?”

“Thank you,” said Boscovitch. “It’s excessively good of you, doctor.
Ah, here comes the train. I hope it won’t inconvenience you to stay
and see to the matter.”

“Not in the least,” replied Thorndyke. “We are not due at Warmington
until tomorrow afternoon, and I expect we can find out all that is
necessary to know and still keep our appointment.”

As Thorndyke spoke, the stranger, who had kept close to us with the
evident purpose of hearing what was said, bestowed on him a very
curious and attentive look; and it was only when the train had
actually come to rest by the platform that he hurried away to find a
compartment.

No sooner had the train left the station than Thorndyke sought out
the station-master and informed him of the instructions that he had
received from Boscovitch. “Of course,” he added, in conclusion, “we
must not move in the matter until the police arrive. I suppose they
have been informed?”

“Yes,” replied the station-master; “I sent a message at once to the
Chief Constable, and I expect him or an inspector at any moment. In
fact, I think I will slip out to the approach and see if he is
coming.” He evidently wished to have a word in private with the
police officer before committing himself to any statement.

As the official departed, Thorndyke and I began to pace the now empty
platform, and my friend, as was his wont, when entering on a new
inquiry, meditatively reviewed the features of the problem.

“In a case of this kind,” he remarked, “we have to decide on one of
three possible explanations: accident, suicide or homicide; and our
decision will be determined by inferences from three sets of facts:
first, the general facts of the case; second, the special data
obtained by examination of the body, and, third, the special data
obtained by examining the spot on which the body was found. Now the
only general facts at present in our possession are that the deceased
was a diamond merchant making a journey for a specific purpose and
probably having on his person property of small bulk and great value.
These facts are somewhat against the hypothesis of suicide and
somewhat favourable to that of homicide. Facts relevant to the
question of accident would be the existence or otherwise of a level
crossing, a road or path leading to the line, an enclosing fence with
or without a gate, and any other facts rendering probable or
otherwise the accidental presence of the deceased at the spot where
the body was found. As we do not possess these facts, it is desirable
that we extend our knowledge.”

“Why not put a few discreet questions to the porter who brought in
the bag and umbrella?” I suggested. “He is at this moment in earnest
conversation with the ticket collector and would, no doubt, be glad
of a new listener.”

“An excellent suggestion, Jervis,” answered Thorndyke. “Let us see
what he has to tell us.” We approached the porter and found him, as I
had anticipated, bursting to unburden himself of the tragic story.

“The way the thing happened, sir, was this,” he said, in answer to
Thorndyke’s question: “There’s a sharpish bend in the road just at
that place, and the goods train was just rounding the curve when the
driver suddenly caught sight of something lying across the rails. As
the engine turned, the headlights shone on it and then he saw it was
a man. He shut off steam at once, blew his whistle, and put the
brakes down hard, but, as you know, sir, a goods train takes some
stopping; before they could bring her up, the engine and half-a-dozen
trucks had gone over the poor beggar.”

“Could the driver see how the man was lying?” Thorndyke asked.

“Yes, he could see him quite plain, because the head lights were full
on him. He was lying on his face with his neck over the near rail on
the down side. His head was in the four-foot and his body by the side
of the track. It looked as if he had laid himself out a-purpose.”

“Is there a level crossing thereabouts?” asked Thorndyke.

“No, sir. No crossing, no road, no path, no nothing,” said the
porter, ruthlessly sacrificing grammar to emphasis. “He must have
come across the fields and climbed over the fence to get onto the
permanent way. Deliberate suicide is what it looks like.”

“How did you learn all this?” Thorndyke inquired.

“Why, the driver, you see, sir, when him and his mate had lifted the
body off the track, went on to the next signal box and sent in his
report by telegram. The station-master told me all about it as we
walked down the line.”

Thorndyke thanked the man for his information, and, as we strolled
back towards the lamp-room, discussed the bearing of these new facts.

“Our friend is unquestionably right in one respect,” he said; “this
was not an accident. The man might, if he were near-sighted, deaf or
stupid, have climbed over the fence and got knocked down by the
train. But his position, lying across the rails, can only be
explained by one of two hypotheses: either it was, as the porter
says, deliberate suicide, or else the man was already dead or
insensible. We must leave it at that until we have seen the body,
that is, if the police will allow us to see it. But here comes the
station-master and an officer with him. Let us hear what they have to
say.”

The two officials had evidently made up their minds to decline any
outside assistance. The divisional surgeon would make the necessary
examination, and information could be obtained through the usual
channels. The production of Thorndyke’s card, however, somewhat
altered the situation. The police inspector hummed and hawed
irresolutely, with the card in his hand, but finally agreed to allow
us to view the body, and we entered the lamp-room together, the
station-master leading the way to turn up the gas.

The stretcher stood on the floor by one wall, its grim burden still
hidden by the tarpaulin, and the hand-bag and umbrella lay on a large
box, together with the battered frame of a pair of spectacles from
which the glasses had fallen out.

“Were these spectacles found by the body?” Thorndyke inquired.

“Yes,” replied the station-master. “They were close to the head and
the glass was scattered about on the ballast.”

Thorndyke made a note in his pocket-book, and then, as he inspector
removed the tarpaulin, he glanced down on the corpse, lying limply on
the stretcher and looking grotesquely horrible with its displaced
head and distorted limbs. For fully a minute he remained silently
stooping over the uncanny object, on which the inspector was now
throwing the light of a large lantern; then he stood up and said
quietly to me: “I think we can eliminate two out of the three
hypotheses.”

The inspector looked at him quickly, and was about to ask a question,
when his attention was diverted by the travelling-case which
Thorndyke had laid on a shelf and now opened to abstract a couple of
pairs of dissecting forceps.

“We’ve no authority to make a _post mortem_, you know,” said the
inspector.

“No, of course not,” said Thorndyke. “I am merely going to look into
the mouth.” With one pair of forceps he turned back the lip and,
having scrutinized its inner surface, closely examined the teeth.

“May I trouble you for your lens, Jervis?” he said; and, as I handed
him my doublet ready opened, the inspector brought the lantern close
to the dead face and leaned forward eagerly. In his usual systematic
fashion, Thorndyke slowly passed the lens along the whole range of
sharp, uneven teeth, and then, bringing it back to the centre,
examined with more minuteness the upper incisors. At length, very
delicately, he picked out with his forceps some minute object from
between two of the upper front teeth and held it in the focus of the
lens. Anticipating his next move, I took a labelled microscope-slide
from the case and handed it to him together with a dissecting needle,
and, as he transferred the object to the slide and spread it out with
the needle, I set up the little microscope on the shelf.

“A drop of Farrant and a cover-glass, please, Jervis,” said Thorndyke.

I handed him the bottle, and, when he had let a drop of the mounting
fluid fall gently on the object and put on the cover-slip, he placed
the slide on the stage of the microscope and examined it attentively.

Happening to glance at the inspector, I observed on his countenance a
faint grin, which he politely strove to suppress when he caught my
eye.

“I was thinking, sir,” he said apologetically, “that it’s a bit off
the track to be finding out what he had for dinner. He didn’t die of
unwholesome feeding.”

Thorndyke looked up with a smile. “It doesn’t do, inspector, to
assume that anything is off the track in an inquiry of this kind.
Every fact must have some significance, you know.”

“I don’t see any significance in the diet of a man who has had his
head cut off,” the inspector rejoined defiantly.

“Don’t you?” said Thorndyke. “Is there no interest attaching to the
last meal of a man who has met a violent death? These crumbs, for
instance, that are scattered over the dead man’s waistcoat. Can we
learn nothing from them?”

“I don’t see what you can learn,” was the dogged rejoinder.

Thorndyke picked off the crumbs, one by one, with his forceps, and
having deposited them on a slide, inspected them, first with the lens
and then through the microscope.

“I learn,” said he, “that shortly before his death, the deceased
partook of some kind of whole-meal biscuits, apparently composed
partly of oatmeal.”

“I call that nothing,” said the inspector. “The question that we have
got to settle is not what refreshments had the deceased been taking,
but what was the cause of his death: did he commit suicide? was he
killed by accident? or was there any foul play?”

“I beg your pardon,” said Thorndyke, “the questions that remain to be
settled are, who killed the deceased and with what motive? The others
are already answered as far as I am concerned.”

The inspector stared in sheer amazement not unmixed with incredulity.

“You haven’t been long coming to a conclusion, sir,” he said.

“No, it was a pretty obvious case of murder,” said Thorndyke. “As to
the motive, the deceased was a diamond merchant and is believed to
have had a quantity of stones about his person. I should suggest that
you search the body.”

The inspector gave vent to an exclamation of disgust. “I see,” he
said. “It was just a guess on your part. The dead man was a diamond
merchant and had valuable property about him; therefore he was
murdered.” He drew himself up, and, regarding Thorndyke with stern
reproach, added: “But you must understand, sir, that this is a
judicial inquiry, not a prize competition in a penny paper. And, as
to searching the body, why, that is what I principally came for.” He
ostentatiously turned his back on us and proceeded systematically to
turn out the dead man’s pockets, laying the articles, as he removed
them, on the box by the side of the hand-bag and umbrella.

While he was thus occupied, Thorndyke looked over the body generally,
paying special attention to the soles of the boots, which, to the
inspector’s undissembled amusement, he very thoroughly examined with
the lens.

“I should have thought, sir, that his feet were large enough to be
seen with the naked eye,” was his comment; “but perhaps,” he added,
with a sly glance at the station master, “you’re a little
near-sighted.”

Thorndyke chuckled good-humouredly, and, while the officer continued
his search, he looked over the articles that had already been laid on
the box. The purse and pocket book he naturally left for the
inspector to open, but the reading-glasses, pocket-knife and
card-case and other small pocket articles were subjected to a
searching scrutiny. The inspector watched him out of the corner of
his eye with furtive amusement; saw him hold up the glasses to the
light to estimate their refractive power, peer into the tobacco
pouch, open the cigarette book and examine the watermark of the
paper, and even inspect the contents of the silver match-box.

“What might you have expected to find in his tobacco pouch?” the
officer asked, laying down a bunch of keys from the dead man’s pocket.

“Tobacco,” Thorndyke replied stolidly; “but I did not expect to find
fine-cut Latakia. I don’t remember ever having seen pure Latakia
smoked in cigarettes.”

“You do take an interest in things, sir,” said the inspector, with a
side glance at the stolid station-master.

“I do,” Thorndyke agreed; “and I note that there are no diamonds
among this collection.”

“No, and we don’t know that he had any about him; but there’s a gold
watch and chain, a diamond scarf-pin, and a purse containing”--he
opened it and tipped out its contents into his hand--“twelve pounds
in gold. That doesn’t look much like robbery, does it? What do you
say to the murder theory now?”

“My opinion is unchanged,” said Thorndyke, “and I should like to
examine the spot where the body was found. Has the engine been
inspected?” he added, addressing the station-master.

“I telegraphed to Bradfield to have it examined,” the official
answered. “The report has probably come in by now. I’d better see
before we start down the line.”

We emerged from the lamp-room and, at the door, found the
station-inspector waiting with a telegram. He handed it to the
station-master, who read it aloud.

“The engine has been carefully examined by me. I find small smear of
blood on near leading wheel and smaller one on next wheel following.
No other marks.” He glanced questioningly at Thorndyke, who nodded
and remarked: “It will be interesting to see if the line tells the
same tale.”

The station-master looked puzzled and was apparently about to ask for
an explanation; but the inspector, who had carefully pocketed the
dead man’s property, was impatient to start and, accordingly, when
Thorndyke had repacked his case and had, at his own request, been
furnished with a lantern, we set off down the permanent way,
Thorndyke carrying the light and I the indispensable green case.

“I am a little in the dark about this affair,” I said, when we had
allowed the two officials to draw ahead out of ear shot; “you came to
a conclusion remarkably quickly. What was it that so immediately
determined the opinion of murder as against suicide?”

“It was a small matter but very conclusive,” replied Thorndyke. “You
noticed a small scalp-wound above the left temple? It was a glancing
wound, and might easily have been made by the engine. But--the wound
had bled; and it had bled for an appreciable time. There were two
streams of blood from it, and in both the blood was firmly clotted
and partially dried. But the man had been decapitated; and this
wound, if inflicted by the engine, must have been made after the
decapitation, since it was on the side most distant from the engine
as it approached. Now, a decapitated head does not bleed. Therefore,
this wound was inflicted before the decapitation.

“But not only had the wound bled: the blood had trickled down in two
streams at right angles to one another. First, in the order of time
as shown by the appearance of the stream, it had trickled down the
side of the face and dropped on the collar. The second stream ran
from the wound to the back of the head. Now, you know, Jervis, there
are no exceptions to the law of gravity. If the blood ran down the
face towards the chin, the face must have been upright at the time;
and if the blood trickled from the front to the back of the head, the
head must have been horizontal and face upwards. But the man when he
was seen by the engine driver, was lying _face downwards_. The only
possible inference is that when the wound was inflicted, the man was
in the upright position--standing or sitting; and that subsequently,
and while he was still alive, he lay on his back for a sufficiently
long time for the blood to have trickled to the back of his head.”

“I see. I was a duffer not to have reasoned this out for myself,” I
remarked contritely.

“Quick observation and rapid inference come by practice,” replied
Thorndyke. “What did you notice about the face?”

“I thought there was a strong suggestion of asphyxia.”

“Undoubtedly,” said Thorndyke. “It was the face of a suffocated man.
You must have noticed, too, that the tongue was very distinctly
swollen and that on the inside of the upper lip were deep
indentations made by the teeth, as well as one or two slight wounds,
obviously caused by heavy pressure on the mouth. And now observe how
completely these facts and inferences agree with those from the scalp
wound. If we knew that the deceased had received a blow on the head,
had struggled with his assailant and been finally borne down and
suffocated, we should look for precisely those signs which we have
found.”

“By the way, what was it that you found wedged between the teeth? I
did not get a chance to look through the microscope.”

“Ah!” said Thorndyke, “there we not only get confirmation, but we
carry our inferences a stage further. The object was a little tuft of
some textile fabric. Under the microscope I found it to consist of
several different fibres, differently dyed. The bulk of it consisted
of wool fibres dyed crimson, but there were also cotton fibres dyed
blue and a few which looked like jute, dyed yellow. It was obviously
a parti-coloured fabric and might have been part of a woman’s dress,
though the presence of the jute is much more suggestive of a curtain
or rug of inferior quality.”

“And its importance?”

“Is that, if it is not part of an article of clothing, then it must
have come from an article of furniture, and furniture suggests a
habitation.”

“That doesn’t seem very conclusive,” I objected.

“It is not; but it is valuable corroboration.”

“Of what?”

“Of the suggestion offered by the soles of the dead man’s boots. I
examined them most minutely and could find no trace of sand, gravel
or earth, in spite of the fact that he must have crossed fields and
rough land to reach the place where he was found. What I did find was
fine tobacco ash, a charred mark as if a cigar or cigarette had been
trodden on, Several crumbs of biscuit, and, on a projecting brad,
some coloured fibres, apparently from a carpet. The manifest
suggestion is that the man was killed in a house with a carpeted
floor, and carried from thence to the railway.”

I was silent for some moments. Well as I knew Thorndyke, I was
completely taken by surprise; a sensation, indeed, that I experienced
anew every time that I accompanied him on one of his investigations.
His marvellous power of co-ordinating apparently insignificant facts,
of arranging them into an ordered sequence and making them tell a
coherent story, was a phenomenon that I never got used to; every
exhibition of it astonished me afresh.

“If your inferences are correct,” I said, “the problem is practically
solved. There must be abundant traces inside the house. The only
question is, which house is it?”

“Quite so,” replied Thorndyke; “that is the question, and a very
difficult question it is. A glance at that interior would doubtless
clear up the whole mystery. But how are we to get that glance? We
cannot enter houses speculatively to see if they present traces of a
murder. At present, our clue breaks off abruptly. The other end of it
is in some unknown house, and, if we cannot join up the two ends, our
problem remains unsolved. For the question is, you remember, Who
killed Oscar Brodski?”

“Then what do you propose to do?” I asked.

“The next stage of the inquiry is to connect some particular house
with this crime. To that end, I can only gather up all available
facts and consider each in all its possible bearings. If I cannot
establish any such connection, then the inquiry will have failed and
we shall have to make a fresh start--say, at Amsterdam, if it turns
out that Brodski really had diamonds on his person, as I have no
doubt he had.” Here our conversation was interrupted by our arrival
at the spot where the body had been found. The station-master had
halted, and he and the inspector were now examining the near rail by
the light of their lanterns.

“There’s remarkably little blood about,” said the former. “I’ve seen
a good many accidents of this kind and there has always been a lot of
blood, both on the engine and on the road. It’s very curious.”

Thorndyke glanced at the rail with but slight attention: that
question had ceased to interest him. But the light of his lantern
flashed onto the ground at the side of the track--a loose, gravelly
soil mixed with fragments of chalk--and from thence to the soles of
the inspector’s boots, which were displayed as he knelt by the rail.

“You observe, Jervis?” he said in a low voice, and I nodded. The
inspector’s boot-soles were covered with adherent particles of gravel
and conspicuously marked by the chalk on which he had trodden.

“You haven’t found the hat, I suppose?” Thorndyke asked, stooping to
pick up a short piece of string that lay on the ground at the side of
the track.

“No,” replied the inspector, “but it can’t be far off. You seem to
have found another clue, sir,” he added, with a grin, glancing at the
piece of string.

“Who knows,” said Thorndyke. “A short end of white twine with a green
strand in it. It may tell us something later. At any rate we’ll keep
it,” and, taking from his pocket a small tin box containing, among
other things, a number of seed envelopes, he slipped the string into
one of the latter and scribbled a note in pencil on the outside. The
inspector watched his proceedings with an indulgent smile, and then
returned to his examination of the track, in which Thorndyke now
joined.

“I suppose the poor chap was near-sighted,” the officer remarked,
indicating the remains of the shattered spectacles; “that might
account for his having strayed onto the line.”

“Possibly,” said Thorndyke. He had already noticed the fragments
scattered over a sleeper and the adjacent ballast, and now once more
produced his “collecting-box,” from which he took another seed
envelope. “Would you hand me a pair of forceps, Jervis,” he said;
“and perhaps you wouldn’t mind taking a pair yourself and helping me
to gather up these fragments.”

As I complied, the inspector looked up curiously.

“There isn’t any doubt that these spectacles belonged to the
deceased, is there?” he asked. “He certainly wore spectacles, for I
saw the mark on his nose.”

“Still, there is no harm in verifying the fact,” said Thorndyke, and
he added to me in a lower tone, “Pick up every particle you can find,
Jervis. It may be most important.”

“I don’t quite see how,” I said, groping amongst the shingle by the
light of the lantern in search of the tiny splinters of glass.

“Don’t you?” returned Thorndyke. “Well, look at these fragments; some
of them are a fair size, but many of these on the sleeper are mere
grains. And consider their number. Obviously, the condition of the
glass does not agree with the circumstances in which we find it.
These are thick con cave spectacle-lenses broken into a great number
of minute fragments. Now how were they broken? Not merely by falling,
evidently: such a lens, when it is dropped, breaks into a small
number of large pieces. Nor were they broken by the wheel passing
over them, for they would then have been reduced to fine powder, and
that powder would have been visible on the rail, which it is not. The
spectacle frames, you may remember, presented the same incongruity:
they were battered and damaged more than they would have been by
falling, but not nearly so much as they would have been if the wheel
had passed over them.”

“What do you suggest, then?” I asked.

“The appearances suggest that the spectacles had been trodden on.
But, if the body was carried here the probability is that the
spectacles were carried here too, and that they were then already
broken; for it is more likely that they were trodden on during the
struggle than that the murderer trod on them after bringing them
here. Hence the importance of picking up every fragment.”

“But why?” I inquired, rather foolishly, I must admit.

“Because, if, when we have picked up every fragment that we can find,
there still remains missing a larger portion of the lenses than we
could reasonably expect, that would tend to support our hypothesis
and we might find the missing remainder elsewhere. If, on the other
hand, we find as much of the lenses as we could expect to find, we
must conclude that they were broken on this spot.”

While we were conducting our search, the two officials were circling
around with their lanterns in quest of the missing hat; and, when we
had at length picked up the last fragment, and a careful search, even
aided by a lens, failed to reveal any other, we could see their
lanterns moving, like will-o’-the-wisps, some distance down the line.

“We may as well see what we have got before our friends come back,”
said Thorndyke, glancing at the twinkling lights. “Lay the case down
on the grass by the fence; it will serve for a table.”

I did so, and Thorndyke, taking a letter from his pocket, opened it,
spread it out flat on the case, securing it with a couple of heavy
stones, although the night was quite calm. Then he tipped the
contents of the seed envelope out on the paper, and carefully
spreading out the pieces of glass, looked at them for some moments in
silence. And, as he looked, there stole over his face a very curious
expression; with sudden eagerness he began picking out the large
fragments and laying them on two visiting-cards which he had taken
from his card-case. Rapidly and with wonderful deftness he fitted the
pieces together, and, as the reconstituted lenses began gradually to
take shape on their cards I looked on with growing excitement, for
something in my colleague’s manner told me that we were on the verge
of a discovery.

At length the two ovals of glass lay on their respective cards,
complete save for one or two small gaps; and the little heap that
remained consisted of fragments so minute as to render further
reconstruction impossible. Then Thorndyke leaned back and laughed
softly.

“This is certainly an unlooked-for result,” said he.

“What is?” I asked.

“Don’t you see, my dear fellow? _There’s too much glass._ We have
almost completely built up the broken lenses, and the fragments that
are left over are considerably more than are required to fill up the
gaps.”

I looked at the little heap of small fragments and saw at once that
it was as he had said. There was a surplus of small pieces.

“This is very extraordinary,” I said. “What do you think can be the
explanation?”

“The fragments will probably tell us,” he replied, “if we ask them
intelligently.”

He lifted the paper and the two cards carefully onto the ground, and,
opening the case, took out the little microscope, to which he fitted
the lowest-power objective and eye-piece--having a combined
magnification of only ten diameters. Then he transferred the minute
fragments of glass to a slide, and, having arranged the lantern as a
microscope-lamp, commenced his examination.

“Hal” he exclaimed presently. “The plot thickens. There is too much
glass and yet too little; that is to say, there are only one or two
fragments here that belong to the spectacles; not nearly enough to
complete the building up of the lenses. The remainder consists of a
soft, uneven, moulded glass, easily distinguished from the clear,
hard optical glass. These foreign fragments are all curved, as if
they had formed part of a cylinder, and are, I should say, portions
of a wine-glass or tumbler.” He moved the slide once or twice, and
then continued: “We are in luck, Jervis. Here is a fragment with two
little diverging lines etched on it, evidently the points of an
eight-rayed star--and here is another with three points--the ends of
three rays. This enables us to reconstruct the vessel perfectly. It
was a clear, thin glass--probably a tumbler--decorated with scattered
stars; I dare say you know the pattern. Sometimes there is an
ornamented band in addition, but generally the stars form the only
decoration. Have a look at the specimen.”

I had just applied my eye to the microscope when the station-master
and the inspector came up. Our appearance, seated on the ground with
the microscope between us, was too much for the police officer’s
gravity, and he laughed long and joyously.

“You must excuse me, gentlemen,” he said apologetically, “but really,
you know, to an old hand, like myself, it does look a
little--well--you understand--I dare say a microscope is a very
interesting and amusing thing, but it doesn’t get you much forrader
in a case like this, does it?”

“Perhaps not,” replied Thorndyke. “By the way, where did you find the
hat, after all?”

“We haven’t found it,” the inspector replied.

“Then we must help you to continue the search,” said Thorndyke. “If
you will wait a few moments, we will come with you.” He poured a few
drops of xylol balsam on the cards to fix the reconstituted lenses to
their supports and then, packing them and the microscope in the case,
announced that he was ready to start.

“Is there any village or hamlet near?” he asked the station-master.

“None nearer than Corfield. That is about half-a-mile from here.”

“And where is the nearest road?”

“There is a half-made road that runs past a house about three hundred
yards from here. It belonged to a building estate that was never
built. There is a footpath from it to the station.”

“Are there any other houses near?”

“No. That is the only house for half-a-mile round, and there is no
other road near here.”

“Then the probability is that Brodski approached the rail way from
that direction, as he was found on that side of the permanent way.”

The inspector agreeing with this view, we all set off slowly towards
the house, piloted by the station-master and searching the ground as
we went. The waste land over which we passed was covered with patches
of docks and nettles, through each of which the inspector kicked his
way, searching with feet and lantern for the missing hat. A walk of
three hundred yards brought us to a low wall enclosing a garden,
beyond which we could see a small house; and here we halted while the
inspector waded into a large bed of nettles beside the wall and
kicked vigorously. Suddenly there came a clinking sound mingled with
objurgations, and the inspector hopped out holding one foot and
soliloquizing profanely.

“I wonder what sort of a fool put a thing like that into a bed of
nettles!” he exclaimed, stroking the injured foot. Thorndyke picked
the object up and held it in the light of the lantern, displaying a
piece of three-quarter inch rolled iron bar about a foot long. “It
doesn’t seem to have been here very long,” he observed, examining it
closely, “there is hardly any rust on it.”

“It has been there long enough for me,” growled the inspector, “and
I’d like to bang it on the head of the blighter that put it there.”

Callously indifferent to the inspector’s sufferings, Thorndyke
continued calmly to examine the bar. At length, resting his lantern
on the wall, he produced his pocket-lens, with which he resumed his
investigation, a proceeding that so exasperated the inspector that
that afflicted official limped off in dudgeon, followed by the
station-master, and we heard him, presently, rapping at the front
door of the house.

“Give me a slide, Jervis, with a drop of Farrant on it,” said
Thorndyke. “There are some fibres sticking to this bar.”

I prepared the slide, and, having handed it to him together with a
cover-glass, a pair of forceps and a needle, set up the microscope on
the wall.

“I’m sorry for the inspector,” Thorndyke remarked, with his eye
applied to the little instrument, “but that was a lucky kick for us.
Just take a look at the specimen.”

I did so, and, having moved the slide about until I had seen the
whole of the object, I gave my opinion. “Red wool fibres, blue cotton
fibres and some yellow vegetable fibres that look like jute.”

“Yes,” said Thorndyke; “the same combination of fibres as that which
we found on the dead man’s teeth and probably from the same source.
This bar has probably been wiped on that very curtain or rug with
which poor Brodski was stifled. We will place it on the wall for
future reference, and meanwhile, by hook or by crook, we must get
into that house. This is much too plain a hint to be disregarded.”

Hastily repacking the case, we hurried to the front of the house,
where we found the two officials looking rather vaguely up the unmade
road.

“There’s a light in the house,” said the inspector, “but there’s no
one at home. I have knocked a dozen times and got no answer. And I
don’t see what we are hanging about here for at all. The hat is
probably close to where the body was found, and we shall find it in
the morning.”

Thorndyke made no reply, but, entering the garden, stepped up the
path, and having knocked gently at the door, stooped and listened
attentively at the keyhole.

“I tell you there’s no one in the house, sir,” said the inspector
irritably; and, as Thorndyke continued to listen, he walked away,
muttering angrily. As soon as he was gone, Thorndyke flashed his
lantern over the door, the threshold, the path and the small
flower-beds; and, from one of the latter, I presently saw him stoop
and pick something up.

“Here is a highly instructive object, Jervis,” he said, coming out to
the gate, and displaying a cigarette of which only half-an-inch had
been smoked.

“How instructive?” I asked. “What do you learn from it?”

“Many things,” he replied. “It has been lit and thrown away unsmoked;
that indicates a sudden change of purpose. It was thrown away at the
entrance to the house, almost certainly by some one entering it. That
person was probably a stranger, or he would have taken it in with
him. But he had not expected to enter the house, or he would not have
lit it. These are the general suggestions; now as to the particular
ones. The paper of the cigarette is of the kind known as the
‘Zig-Zag’ brand; the very conspicuous watermark is quite easy to see.
Now Brodski’s cigarette book was a ‘Zig-Zag’ book--so called from the
way in which the papers pull out. But let us see what the tobacco is
like.” With a pin from his coat, he hooked out from the unburned end
a wisp of dark, dirty brown tobacco, which he held out for my
inspection.

“Fine-cut Latakia,” I pronounced, without hesitation.

“Very well,” said Thorndyke. “Here is a cigarette made of an unusual
tobacco similar to that in Brodski’s pouch and wrapped in an unusual
paper similar to those in Brodski’s cigarette book. With due regard
to the fourth rule of the syllogism, I suggest that this cigarette
was made by Oscar Brodski. But, nevertheless, we will look for
corroborative detail.”

“What is that?” I asked.

“You may have noticed that Brodski’s match-box contained round wooden
vestas--which are also rather unusual. As he must have lighted the
cigarette within a few steps of the gate, we ought to be able to find
the match with which he lighted it. Let us try up the road in the
direction from which he would probably have approached.”

We walked very slowly up the road, searching the ground with the
lantern, and we had hardly gone a dozen paces when I espied a match
lying on the rough path and eagerly picked it up. It was a round
wooden vesta.

Thorndyke examined it with interest and having deposited it, with the
cigarette, in his “collecting-box,” turned to retrace his steps.
“There is now, Jervis, no reasonable doubt that Brodski was murdered
in that house. We have succeeded in connecting that house with the
crime, and now we have got to force an entrance and join up the other
clues.” We walked quickly back to the rear of the premises, where we
found the inspector conversing disconsolately with the station-master.

“I think, sir,” said the former, “we had better go back now; in fact,
I don’t see what we came here for, but--here! I say, sir, you mustn’t
do that!” For Thorndyke, without a word of warning, had sprung up
lightly and thrown one of his long legs over the wall.

“I can’t allow you to enter private premises, sir,” continued the
inspector; but Thorndyke quietly dropped down on the inside and
turned to face the officer over the wall.

“Now, listen to me, inspector,” said he. “I have good reasons for
believing that the dead man, Brodski, has been in this house, in
fact, I am prepared to swear an information to that effect. But time
is precious; we must follow the scent while it is hot. And I am not
proposing to break into the house off-hand. I merely wish to examine
the dust-bin.”

“The dust-bin!” gasped the inspector. “Well, you really are a most
extraordinary gentleman! What do you expect to find in the dust-bin?”

“I am looking for a broken tumbler or wine-glass. It is a thin glass
vessel decorated with a pattern of small, eight pointed stars. It may
be in the dust-bin or it may be inside the house.”

The inspector hesitated, but Thorndyke’s confident manner had
evidently impressed him.

“We can soon see what is in the dust-bin,” he said, “though what in
creation a broken tumbler has to do with the case is more than I can
understand. However, here goes.” He sprang up onto the wall, and, as
he dropped down into the garden, the station-master and I followed.

Thorndyke lingered a few moments by the gate examining the ground,
while the two officials hurried up the path. Finding nothing of
interest, however, he walked towards the house, looking keenly about
him as he went; but we were hardly half-way up the path when we heard
the voice of the inspector calling excitedly.

“Here you are, sir, this way,” he sang out, and, as we hurried
forward, we suddenly came on the two officials standing over a small
rubbish-heap and looking the picture of astonishment. The glare of
their lanterns illuminated the heap, and showed us the scattered
fragments of a thin glass, star-pattern tumbler.

“I can’t imagine how you guessed it was here, sir,” said the
inspector, with a new-born respect in his tone, “nor what you’re
going to do with it now you have found it.”

“It is merely another link in the chain of evidence,” said Thorndyke,
taking a pair of forceps from the case and stooping over the heap.
“Perhaps we shall find something else.” He picked up several small
fragments of glass, looked at them closely and dropped them again.
Suddenly his eye caught a small splinter at the base of the heap.
Seizing it with the forceps, he held it close to his eye in the
strong lamplight, and, taking out his lens, examined it with minute
attention. “Yes,” he said at length, “this is what I was looking for.
Let me have those two cards, Jervis.”

I produced the two visiting-cards with the reconstructed lenses stuck
to them, and, laying them on the lid of the case, threw the light of
the lantern on them. Thorndyke looked at them intently for some time,
and from them to the fragment that he held. Then, turning to the
inspector, he said: “You saw me pick up this splinter of glass?”

“Yes, sir,” replied the officer.

“And you saw where we found these spectacle-glasses and know whose
they were?”

“Yes, sir. They are the dead man’s spectacles, and you found them
where the body had been.”

“Very well,” said Thorndyke; “now observe;” and, as the two officials
craned forward with parted lips, he laid the little splinter in a gap
in one of the lenses and then gave it a gentle push forward, when it
occupied the gap perfectly, joining edge to edge with the adjacent
fragments and rendering that portion of the lens complete.

“My God!” exclaimed the inspector. “How on earth did you know?”

“I must explain that later,” said Thorndyke. “Meanwhile we had better
have a look inside the house. I expect to find there a cigarette--or
possibly a cigar--which has been trodden on, some whole-meal
biscuits, possibly a wooden vesta, and perhaps even the missing hat.”

At the mention of the hat, the inspector stepped eagerly to the back
door, but, finding it bolted, he tried the window. This also was
securely fastened and, on Thorndyke’s advice, we went round to the
front door.

“This door is locked too,” said the inspector. “I’m afraid we shall
have to break in. It’s a nuisance, though.”

“Have a look at the window,” suggested Thorndyke.

The officer did so, struggling vainly to undo the patent catch with
his pocket-knife.

“It’s no go,” he said, coming back to the door. “We shall have
to----” He broke off with an astonished stare, for the door stood
open and Thorndyke was putting something in his pocket.

“Your friend doesn’t waste much time--even in picking a lock,” he
remarked to me, as we followed Thorndyke into the house; but his
reflections were soon merged in a new surprise. Thorndyke had
preceded us into a small sitting-room dimly lighted by a hanging lamp
turned down low.

As we entered he turned up the light and glanced about the room. A
whisky-bottle was on the table, with a siphon, a tumbler and a
biscuit-box. Pointing to the latter, Thorndyke said to the inspector:
“See what is in that box.”

The inspector raised the lid and peeped in, the station master peered
over his shoulder, and then both stared at Thorndyke.

“How in the name of goodness did you know that there were whole-meal
biscuits in the house, sir?” exclaimed the station-master.

“You’d be disappointed if I told you,” replied Thorndyke. “But look
at this.” He pointed to the hearth, where lay a flattened,
half-smoked cigarette and a round wooden vesta. The inspector gazed
at these objects in silent wonder, while, as to the station-master,
he continued to stare at Thorndyke with what I can only describe as
superstitious awe.

“You have the dead man’s property with you, I believe?” said my
colleague.

“Yes,” replied the inspector; “I put the things in my pocket for
safety.”

“Then,” said Thorndyke, picking up the flattened cigarette, “let us
have a look at his tobacco-pouch.”

As the officer produced and opened the pouch, Thorndyke neatly cut
open the cigarette with his sharp pocket-knife. “Now,” said he, “what
kind of tobacco is in the pouch?”

The inspector took out a pinch, looked at it and smelt it
distastefully. “It’s one of those stinking tobaccos,” he said, “that
they put in mixtures--Latakia, I think.”

“And what is this?” asked Thorndyke, pointing to the open cigarette.

“Same stuff, undoubtedly,” replied the inspector.

“And now let us see his cigarette papers,” said Thorndyke.

The little book, or rather packet--for it consisted of separated
papers--was produced from the officer’s pocket and a sample paper
abstracted. Thorndyke laid the half burnt paper beside it, and the
inspector, having examined the two, held them up to the light.

“There isn’t much chance of mistaking that ‘Zig-Zag’ watermark,” he
said. “This cigarette was made by the deceased; there can’t be the
shadow of a doubt.”

“One more point,” said Thorndyke, laying the burnt wooden vesta on
the table. “You have his match-box?”

The inspector brought forth the little silver casket, opened it and
compared the wooden vestas that it contained with the burnt end. Then
he shut the box with a snap.

“You’ve proved it up to the hilt,” said he. “If we could only find
the hat, we should have a complete case.”

“I’m not sure that we haven’t found the hat,” said Thorndyke. “You
notice that something besides coal has been burned in the grate.”

The inspector ran eagerly to the fire-place and began with feverish
hands, to pick out the remains of the extinct fire. “The cinders are
still warm,” he said, “and they are certainly not all coal cinders.
There has been wood burned here on top of the coal, and these little
black lumps are neither coal nor wood. They may quite possibly be the
remains of a burnt hat, but, lord! who can tell? You can put together
the pieces of broken spectacle-glasses, but you can’t build up a hat
out of a few cinders.” He held out a handful of little, black, spongy
cinders and looked ruefully at Thorndyke, who took them from him and
laid them out on a sheet of paper.

“We can’t reconstitute the hat, certainly,” my friend agreed, “but we
may be able to ascertain the origin of these remains. They may not be
cinders of a hat, after all.” He lit a wax match and, taking up one
of the charred fragments, applied the flame to it. The cindery mass
fused at once with a crackling, seething sound, emitting a dense
smoke, and instantly the air became charged with a pungent, resinous
odour mingled with the smell of burning animal matter.

“Smells like varnish,” the station-master remarked.

“Yes. Shellac,” said Thorndyke; “so the first test gives a positive
result. The next test will take more time.”

He opened the green case and took from it a little flask, fitted for
Marsh’s arsenic test, with a safety funnel and escape tube, a small
folding tripod, a spirit lamp and a disc of asbestos to serve as a
sand-bath. Dropping into the flask several of the cindery masses,
selected after careful inspection, he filled it up with alcohol and
placed it on the disc, which he rested on the tripod. Then he lighted
the spirit lamp underneath and sat down to wait for the alcohol to
boil.

“There is one little point that we may as well settle,” he said
presently, as the bubbles began to rise in the flask. “Give me a
slide with a drop of Farrant on it, Jervis.”

I prepared the slide while Thorndyke, with a pair of forceps, picked
out a tiny wisp from the table-cloth. “I fancy we have seen this
fabric before,” he remarked, as he laid the little pinch of fluff in
the mounting fluid and slipped the slide onto the stage of the
microscope. “Yes,” he continued, looking into the eye-piece, “here
are our old acquaintances, the red wool fibres, the blue cotton and
the yellow jute. We must label this at once or we may confuse it with
the other specimens.”

“Have you any idea how the deceased met his death?” the inspector
asked.

“Yes,” replied Thorndyke. “I take it that the murderer enticed him
into this room and gave him some refreshments. The murderer sat in
the chair in which you are sitting, Brodski sat in that small
arm-chair. Then I imagine the murderer attacked him with that iron
bar that you found among the nettles, failed to kill him at the first
stroke, struggled with him and finally suffocated him with the
tablecloth. By the way, there is just one more point. You recognize
this piece of string?” He took from his “collecting-box” the little
end of twine that had been picked up by the line. The inspector
nodded. “Look behind you, you will see where it came from.”

The officer turned sharply and his eye lighted on a string box on the
mantelpiece. He lifted it down, and Thorndyke drew out from it a
length of white twine with one green strand, which he compared with
the piece in his hand. “The green strand in it makes the
identification fairly certain,” he said. “Of course the string was
used to secure the umbrella and hand-bag. He could not have carried
them in his hand, encumbered as he was with the corpse. But I expect
our other specimen is ready now.” He lifted the flask off the tripod,
and, giving it a vigorous shake, examined the contents through his
lens. The alcohol had now become dark-brown in colour, and was
noticeably thicker and more syrupy in consistence.

“I think we have enough here for a rough test,” said he, selecting a
pipette and a slide from the case. He dipped the former into the
flask and, having sucked up a few drops of the alcohol from the
bottom, held the pipette over the slide on which he allowed the
contained fluid to drop.

Laying a cover-glass on the little pool of alcohol, he put the slide
on the microscope stage and examined it attentively, while we watched
him in expectant silence.

At length he looked up, and, addressing the inspector, asked: “Do you
know what felt hats are made of?”

“I can’t say that I do, sir,” replied the officer.

“Well, the better quality hats are made of rabbits’ and hares’
wool--the soft under-fur, you know--cemented together with shellac.
Now there is very little doubt that these cinders contain shellac,
and with the microscope I find a number of small hairs of a rabbit. I
have, therefore, little hesitation in saying that these cinders are
the remains of a hard felt hat; and, as the hairs do not appear to be
dyed, I should say it was a grey hat.”

At this moment our conclave was interrupted by hurried footsteps on
the garden path and, as we turned with one accord, an elderly woman
burst into the room.

She stood for a moment in mute astonishment, and then, looking from
one to the other, demanded: “Who are you? and what are you doing
here?”

The inspector rose. “I am a police officer, madam,” said he. “I can’t
give you any further information just now, but, if you will excuse me
asking, who are you?”

“I am Mr. Hickler’s housekeeper,” she replied.

“And Mr. Hickler; are you expecting him home shortly?”

“No, I am not,” was the curt reply. “Mr. Hickler is away from home
just now. He left this evening by the boat train.”

“For Amsterdam?” asked Thorndyke.

“I believe so, though I don’t see what business it is of yours,” the
housekeeper answered.

“I thought he might, perhaps, be a diamond broker or merchant,” said
Thorndyke. “A good many of them travel by that train.”

“So he is,” said the woman, “at least, he has something to do with
diamonds.”

“Ah. Well, we must be going, Jervis,” said Thorndyke, “we have
finished here, and we have to find an hotel or inn. Can I have a word
with you, inspector?”

The officer, now entirely humble and reverent, followed us out into
the garden to receive Thorndyke’s parting advice.

“You had better take possession of the house at once, and get rid of
the housekeeper. Nothing must be removed. Preserve those cinders and
see that the rubbish-heap is not disturbed, and, above all, don’t
have the room swept. An officer will be sent to relieve you.”

With a friendly “good-night” we went on our way, guided by the
station-master; and here our connection with the case came to an end.
Hickler (whose Christian name turned out to be Silas) was, it is
true, arrested as he stepped ashore from the steamer, and a packet of
diamonds, subsequently identified as the property of Oscar Brodski,
found upon his person. But he was never brought to trial, for on the
return voyage he contrived to elude his guards for an instant as the
ship was approaching the English coast, and it was not until three
days later, when a hand-cuffed body was cast up on the lonely shore
by Orfordness, that the authorities knew the fate of Silas Hickler.

“An appropriate and dramatic end to a singular and yet typical case,”
said Thorndyke, as he put down the newspaper. “I hope it has enlarged
your knowledge, Jervis, and enabled you to form one or two useful
corollaries.”

“I prefer to hear you sing the medico-legal doxology,” I answered,
turning upon him like the proverbial worm and grinning derisively
(which the worm does not).

“I know you do,” he retorted, with mock gravity, “and I lament your
lack of mental initiative. However, the points that this case
illustrates are these: First, the danger of delay; the vital
importance of instant action before that frail and fleeting thing
that we call a clue has time to evaporate. A delay of a few hours
would have left us with hardly a single datum. Second, the necessity
of pursuing the most trivial clue to an absolute finish, as
illustrated by the spectacles. Third, the urgent need of a trained
scientist to aid the police; and, last,” he concluded, with a smile,
“we learn never to go abroad without the invaluable green case.”




A CASE OF PREMEDITATION


PART I

THE ELIMINATION OF MR. PRATT

The wine merchant who should supply a consignment of _petit vin_ to a
customer who had ordered, and paid for, a vintage wine, would render
himself subject to unambiguous comment. Nay! more; he would be liable
to certain legal penalties. And yet his conduct would be morally
indistinguishable from that of the railway company which, having
accepted a first-class fare, inflicts upon the passenger that kind of
company which he has paid to avoid. But the corporate conscience, as
Herbert Spencer was wont to explain, is an altogether inferior
product to that of the individual.

Such were the reflections of Mr. Rufus Pembury when, as the train was
about to move out of Maidstone (West) station, a coarse and burly man
(clearly a denizen of the third class) was ushered into his
compartment by the guard. He had paid the higher fare, not for
cushioned seats, but for seclusion or, at least, select
companionship. The man’s entry had deprived him of both, and he
resented it.

But if the presence of this stranger involved a breach of contract,
his conduct was a positive affront--an indignity; for, no sooner had
the train started than he fixed upon Mr. Pembury a gaze of
impertinent intensity, and continued thereafter to regard him with a
stare as steady and unwinking as that of a Polynesian idol.

It was offensive to a degree, and highly disconcerting withal. Mr.
Pembury fidgeted in his seat with increasing discomfort and rising
temper. He looked into his pocket book, read one or two letters and
sorted a collection of visiting-cards. He even thought of opening his
umbrella. Finally, his patience exhausted and his wrath mounting to
boiling-point, he turned to the stranger with frosty remonstrance.

“I imagine, sir, that you will have no difficulty in recognizing me,
should we ever meet again--which God forbid.”

“I should recognize you among ten thousand,” was the reply, so
unexpected as to leave Mr. Pembury speechless.

“You see,” the stranger continued impressively, “I’ve got the gift of
faces. I never forget.”

“That must be a great consolation,” said Pembury.

“It’s very useful to me,” said the stranger, “at least, it used to
be, when I was a warder at Portland--you remember me, I dare say: my
name is Pratt. I was assistant-warder in your time. God-forsaken
hole, Portland, and mighty glad I was when they used to send me up to
town on reckernizing duty. Holloway was the house of detention then,
you remember; that was before they moved to Brixton.”

Pratt paused in his reminiscences, and Pembury, pale and gasping with
astonishment, pulled himself together.

“I think,” said he, “you must be mistaking me for some one else.”

“I don’t,” replied Pratt. “You’re Francis Dobbs, that’s who you are.
Slipped away from Portland one evening about twelve years ago.
Clothes washed up on the Bill next day. No trace of fugitive. As neat
a mizzle as ever I heard of. But there are a couple of photographs
and a set of finger-prints at the Habitual Criminals Register.
P’r’aps you’d like to come and see ’em?”

“Why should I go to the Habitual Criminals Register?” Pembury
demanded faintly.

“Ah! Exactly. Why should you? When you are a man of means, and a
little judiciously invested capital would render it unnecessary?”

Pembury looked out of the window, and for a minute or more preserved
a stony silence. At length he turned suddenly to Pratt. “How much?”
he asked.

“I shouldn’t think a couple of hundred a year would hurt you,” was
the calm reply.

Pembury reflected awhile. “What makes you think I am a man of means?”
he asked presently.

Pratt smiled grimly. “Bless you, Mr. Pembury,” said he, “I know all
about you. Why, for the last six months I have been living within
half-a-mile of your house.”

“The devil you have!”

“Yes. When I retired from the service, General O’Gorman engaged me as
a sort of steward or caretaker of his little place at Baysford--he’s
very seldom there himself--and the very day after I came down, I met
you and spotted you, but, naturally, I kept out of sight myself.
Thought I’d find out whether you were good for anything before I
spoke, so I’ve been keeping my ears open and I find you are good for
a couple of hundred.”

There was an interval of silence, and then the ex-warder resumed--

“That’s what comes of having a memory for faces. Now there’s Jack
Ellis, on the other hand; he must have had you under his nose for a
couple of years, and yet he’s never twigged--he never will either,”
added Pratt, already regretting the confidence into which his vanity
had led him.

“Who is Jack Ellis?” Pembury demanded sharply.

“Why, he’s a sort of supernumerary at the Baysford Police Station;
does odd jobs; rural detective, helps in the office and that sort of
thing. He was in the Civil Guard at Portland, in your time, but he
got his left forefinger chopped off, so they pensioned him, and, as
he was a Baysford man, he got this billet. But he’ll never reckernize
you, don’t you fear.”

“Unless you direct his attention to me,” suggested Pembury.

“There’s no fear of that,” laughed Pratt. “You can trust me to sit
quiet on my own nest-egg. Besides, we’re not very friendly. He came
nosing round our place after the parlour maid--him a married man,
mark you! But I soon boosted him out, I can tell you; and Jack Ellis
don’t like me now.”

“I see,” said Pembury reflectively; then, after a pause, he asked:
“Who is this General O’Gorman? I seem to know the name.”

“I expect you do,” said Pratt. “He was governor of Dartmoor when I
was there--that was my last billet--and, let me tell you, if he’d
been at Portland in your time, you’d never have got away.”

“How is that?”

“Why, you see, the general is a great man on bloodhounds. He kept a
pack at Dartmoor and, you bet, those lags knew it. There were no
attempted escapes in those days. They wouldn’t have had a chance.”

“He has the pack still, hasn’t he?” asked Pembury.

“Rather. Spends any amount of time on training ’em, too. He’s always
hoping there’ll be a burglary or a murder in the neighbourhood so as
he can try ’em, but he’s never got a chance yet. P’r’aps the crooks
have heard about ’em. But, to come back to our little arrangement:
what do you say to a couple of hundred, paid quarterly, if you like?”

“I can’t settle the matter off-hand,” said Pembury. “You must give me
time to think it over.”

“Very well,” said Pratt. “I shall be back at Baysford to-morrow
evening. That will give you a clear day to think it over. Shall I
look in at your place to-morrow night?”

“No,” replied Pembury; “you’d better not be seen at my house, nor I
at yours. If I meet you at some quiet spot, where we shan’t be seen,
we can settle our business without any one knowing that we have met.
It won’t take long, and we can’t be too careful.”

“That’s true,” agreed Pratt. “Well, I’ll tell you what. There’s an
avenue leading up to our house; you know it, I expect. There’s no
lodge, and the gates are always ajar, excepting at night. Now I shall
be down by the six-thirty at Baysford. Our place is a quarter of an
hour from the station. Say you meet me in the avenue at a quarter to
seven.”

“That will suit me,” said Pembury; “that is, if you are sure the
bloodhounds won’t be straying about the grounds.”

“Lord bless you, no!” laughed Pratt. “D’you suppose the general lets
his precious hounds stray about for any casual crook to feed with
poisoned sausage? No, they’re locked up safe in the kennels at the
back of the house. Hallo! This’ll be Swanley, I expect. I’ll change
into a smoker here and leave you time to turn the matter over in your
mind. So long. To-morrow evening in the avenue at a quarter to seven.
And, I say, Mr. Pembury, you might as well bring the first instalment
with you--fifty, in small notes or gold.”

“Very well,” said Mr. Pembury. He spoke coldly enough, but there was
a flush on his cheeks and an angry light in his eyes, which, perhaps,
the ex-warder noticed; for when he had stepped out and shut the door,
he thrust his head in at the window and said threateningly--

“One more word, Mr. Pembury-Dobbs: no hanky-panky, you know. I’m an
old hand and pretty fly, I am. So don’t you try any chickery-pokery
on me. That’s all.” He withdrew his head and disappeared, leaving
Pembury to his reflections.

The nature of those reflections, if some telepathist--transferring
his attention for the moment from hidden court-yards or missing
thimbles to more practical matters--could have conveyed them into the
mind of Mr. Pratt, would have caused that quondam official some
surprise and, perhaps, a little disquiet. For long experience of the
criminal, as he appears when in durance, had produced some rather
misleading ideas as to his behaviour when at large. In fact, the
ex-warder had considerably under-estimated the ex-convict.

Rufus Pembury, to give his real name--for Dobbs was literally a _nom
de guerre_--was a man of strong character and intelligence. So much
so that, having tried the criminal career and found it not worth
pursuing, he had definitely abandoned it. When the cattle-boat that
picked him up off Portland Bill had landed him at an American port,
he brought his entire ability and energy to bear on legitimate
commercial pursuits, and with such success that, at the end of ten
years, he was able to return to England with a moderate competence.
Then he had taken a modest house near the little town of Baysford,
where he had lived quietly on his savings for the last two years,
holding aloof without much difficulty from the rather exclusive local
society; and here he might have lived out the rest of his life in
peace but for the unlucky chance that brought the man Pratt into the
neighbourhood. With the arrival of Pratt his security was utterly
destroyed.

There is something eminently unsatisfactory about a blackmailer. No
arrangement with him has any permanent validity. No undertaking that
he gives is binding. The thing which he has sold remains in his
possession to sell over again. He pockets the price of emancipation,
but retains the key of the fetters. In short, the blackmailer is a
totally impossible person.

Such were the considerations that had passed through the mind of
Rufus Pembury, even while Pratt was making his proposals; and those
proposals he had never for an instant entertained. The ex-warder’s
advice to him to “turn the matter over in his mind” was unnecessary.
For his mind was already made up. His decision was arrived at in the
very moment when Pratt had disclosed his identity. The conclusion was
self-evident. Before Pratt appeared he was living in peace and
security. While Pratt remained, his liberty was precarious from
moment to moment. If Pratt should disappear, his peace and security
would return. Therefore Pratt must be eliminated.

It was a logical consequence.

The profound meditations, therefore, in which Pembury remained
immersed for the remainder of the journey, had nothing whatever to do
with the quarterly allowance; they were concerned exclusively with
the elimination of ex-warder Pratt.

Now Rufus Pembury was not a ferocious man. He was not even cruel. But
he was gifted with a certain magnanimous cynicism which ignored the
trivialities of sentiment and regarded only the main issues. If a
wasp hummed over his tea-cup, he would crush that wasp; but not with
his bare hand. The wasp carried the means of aggression. That was the
wasp’s look-out. _His_ concern was to avoid being stung.

So it was with Pratt. The man had elected, for his own profit, to
threaten Pembury’s liberty. Very well. He had done it at his own
risk. That risk was no concern of Pembury’s. _His_ concern was his
own safety.

When Pembury alighted at Charing Cross, he directed his steps (after
having watched Pratt’s departure from the station) to Buckingham
Street, Strand, where he entered a quiet private hotel. He was
apparently expected, for the manageress greeted him by his name as
she handed him his key.

“Are you staying in town, Mr. Pembury?” she asked.

“No,” was the reply. “I go back tomorrow morning, but I may be coming
up again shortly. By the way, you used to have an encyclopaedia in
one of the rooms. Could I see it for a moment?”

“It is in the drawing-room,” said the manageress. “Shall I show
you?--but you know the way, don’t you?”

Certainly Mr. Pembury knew the way. It was on the first floor; a
pleasant old-world room looking on the quiet old street; and on a
shelf, amidst a collection of novels, stood the sedate volumes of
_Chambers’s Encyclopædia_.

That a gentleman from the country should desire to look up the
subject of “hounds” would not, to a casual observer, have seemed
unnatural. But when from hounds the student proceeded to the article
on blood, and thence to one devoted to perfumes, the observer might
reasonably have felt some surprise; and this surprise might have been
augmented if he had followed Mr. Pembury’s subsequent proceedings,
and specially if he had considered them as the actions of a man whose
immediate aim was the removal of a superfluous unit of the population.

Having deposited his bag and umbrella in his room, Pembury set forth
from the hotel as one with a definite purpose; and his footsteps led,
in the first place, to an umbrella shop on the Strand, where he
selected a thick rattan cane. There was nothing remarkable in this,
perhaps; but the cane was of an uncomely thickness and the salesman
protested. “I like a thick cane,” said Pembury.

“Yes, sir; but for a gentleman of your height” (Pembury was a small,
slightly-built man) “I would venture to suggest----”

“I like a thick cane,” repeated Pembury. “Cut it down to the proper
length and don’t rivet the ferrule on. I’ll cement it on when I get
home.”

His next investment would have seemed more to the purpose, though
suggestive of unexpected crudity of method. It was a large Norwegian
knife. But not content with this he went on forthwith to a second
cutler’s and purchased a second knife, the exact duplicate of the
first. Now, for what purpose could he want two identically similar
knives? And why not have bought them both at the same shop? It was
highly mysterious.

Shopping appeared to be a positive mania with Rufus Pembury. In the
course of the next half-hour he acquired a cheap handbag, an artist’s
black-japanned brush-case, a three-cornered file, a stick of elastic
glue and a pair of iron crucible-tongs. Still insatiable, he repaired
to an old-fashioned chemist’s shop in a by-street, where he further
enriched himself with a packet of absorbent cotton-wool and an ounce
of permanganate of potash; and, as the chemist wrapped up these
articles, with the occult and necromantic air peculiar to chemists,
Pembury watched him impassively.

“I suppose you don’t keep musk?” he asked carelessly.

The chemist paused in the act of heating a stick of sealing wax, and
appeared as if about to mutter an incantation. But he merely replied:
“No, sir. Not the solid musk; it’s so very costly. But I have the
essence.”

“That isn’t as strong as the pure stuff, I suppose?”

“No,” replied the chemist, with a cryptic smile, “not so strong, but
strong enough. These animal perfumes are so very penetrating, you
know; and so lasting. Why, I venture to say that if you were to
sprinkle a table-spoonful of the essence in the middle of St. Paul’s,
the place would smell of it six months hence.”

“You don’t say so!” said Pembury. “Well, that ought to be enough for
anybody. I’ll take a small quantity, please, and, for goodness’ sake,
see that there isn’t any on the outside of the bottle. The stuff
isn’t for myself, and I don’t want to go about smelling like a civet
cat.”

“Naturally you don’t, sir,” agreed the chemist. He then produced an
ounce bottle, a small glass funnel and a stoppered bottle labelled
“Ess. Moschi,” with which he proceeded to perform a few trifling
feats of legerdemain.

“There, sir,” said he, when he had finished the performance, “there
is not a drop on the outside of the bottle, and, if I fit it with a
rubber cork, you will be quite secure.”

Pembury’s dislike of musk appeared to be excessive, for, when the
chemist had retired into a secret cubicle as if to hold converse with
some familiar spirit (but actually to change half-a-crown), he took
the brush-case from his bag, pulled off its lid, and then, with the
crucible-tongs, daintily lifted the bottle off the counter, slid it
softly into the brush case, and, replacing the lid, returned the case
and tongs to the bag. The other two packets he took from the counter
and dropped into his pocket, and, when the presiding wizard, having
miraculously transformed a single half-crown into four pennies,
handed him the product, he left the shop and walked thoughtfully back
towards the Strand. Suddenly a new idea seemed to strike him. He
halted, considered for a few moments and then strode away northward
to make the oddest of all his purchases.

The transaction took place in a shop in the Seven Dials, whose
strange stock-in-trade ranged the whole zoological gamut, from
water-snails to Angora cats. Pembury looked at a cage of guinea-pigs
in the window and entered the shop.

“Do you happen to have a dead guinea-pig?” he asked.

“No; mine are all alive,” replied the man, adding, with a sinister
grin: “But they’re not immortal, you know.”

Pembury looked at the man distastefully. There is an appreciable
difference between a guinea-pig and a blackmailer. “Any small mammal
would do,” he said.

“There’s a dead rat in that cage, if he’s any good,” said the man.
“Died this morning, so he’s quite fresh.”

“I’ll take the rat,” said Pembury; “he’ll do quite well.”

The little corpse was accordingly made into a parcel and deposited in
the bag, and Pembury, having tendered a complimentary fee, made his
way back to the hotel.

After a modest lunch he went forth and spent the remainder of the day
transacting the business which had originally brought him to town. He
dined at a restaurant and did not return to his hotel until ten
o’clock, when he took his key, and tucking under his arm a parcel
that he had brought in with him, retired for the night. But before
undressing--and after locking his door--he did a very strange and
unaccountable thing. Having pulled off the loose ferrule from his
newly-purchased cane, he bored a hole in the bottom of it with the
spike end of the file. Then, using the latter as a broach, he
enlarged the hole until only a narrow rim of the bottom was left. He
next rolled up a small ball of cotton-wool and pushed it into the
ferrule; and having smeared the end of the cane with elastic glue, he
replaced the ferrule, warming it over the gas to make the glue stick.

When he had finished with the cane, he turned his attention to one of
the Norwegian knives. First, he carefully removed with the file most
of the bright, yellow varnish from the wooden case or handle.

Then he opened the knife, and, cutting the string of the parcel that
he had brought in, took from it the dead rat which he had bought at
the zoologist’s. Laying the animal on a sheet of paper, he cut off
its head, and, holding it up by the tail, allowed the blood that
oozed from the neck to drop on the knife, spreading it over both
sides of the blade and handle with his finger.

Then he laid the knife on the paper and softly opened the window.
From the darkness below came the voice of a cat, apparently
perfecting itself in the execution of chromatic Scales; and in that
direction Pembury flung the body and head of the rat, and closed the
window. Finally, having washed his hands and stuffed the paper from
the parcel into the fire-place, he went to bed.

But his proceedings in the morning were equally mysterious. Having
breakfasted betimes, he returned to his bedroom and locked himself
in. Then he tied his new cane, handle downwards, to the leg of the
dressing-table. Next, with the crucible-tongs, he drew the little
bottle of musk from the brush-case, and, having assured himself, by
sniffing at it, that the exterior was really free from odour, he with
drew the rubber cork. Then, slowly and with infinite care, he poured
a few drops--perhaps half-a-teaspoonful--of the essence on the
cotton-wool that bulged through the hole in the ferrule, watching the
absorbent material narrowly as it soaked up the liquid. When it was
saturated he proceeded to treat the knife in the same fashion,
letting fall a drop of the essence on the wooden handle--which soaked
it up readily. This done, he slid up the window and looked out.
Immediately below was a tiny yard in which grew, or rather survived,
a couple of faded laurel bushes. The body of the rat was nowhere to
be seen; it had apparently been spirited away in the night. Holding
out the bottle, which he still held, he dropped it into the bushes,
flinging the rubber cork after it.

His next proceeding was to take a tube of vaseline from his
dressing-bag and squeeze a small quantity onto his fingers. With this
he thoroughly smeared the shoulder of the brush case and the inside
of the lid, so as to ensure an airtight joint. Having wiped his
fingers, he picked the knife up with the crucible-tongs, and,
dropping it into the brush-case, immediately pushed on the lid. Then
he heated the tips of the tongs in the gas flame to destroy the
scent, packed the tongs and brush-case in the bag, untied the
cane--carefully avoiding contact with the ferrule--and, taking up the
two bags, went out, holding the cane by its middle.

There was no difficulty in finding an empty compartment, for
first-class passengers were few at that time in the morning. Pembury
waited on the platform until the guard’s whistle sounded, when he
stepped into the compartment, shut the door and laid the cane on the
seat with its ferrule projecting out of the off-side window, in which
position it remained until the train drew up in Baysford station.

Pembury left his dressing-bag at the cloak-room, and, still grasping
the cane by its middle, he sallied forth. The town of Baysford lay
some half-a-mile to the east of the station; his own house was a mile
along the road to the west; and half-way between his house and the
station was the residence of General O’Gorman. He knew the place
well. Originally a farmhouse, it stood on the edge of a great expanse
of flat meadows and communicated with the road by an avenue, nearly
three hundred yards long, of ancient trees. The avenue was shut off
from the road by a pair of iron gates, but these were merely
ornamental, for the place was unenclosed and accessible from the
surrounding meadows--indeed, an indistinct footpath crossed the
meadows and intersected the avenue about half-way up.

On this occasion Pembury, whose objective was the avenue, elected to
approach it by the latter route; and at each stile or fence that he
surmounted, he paused to survey the country. Presently the avenue
arose before him, lying athwart the narrow track, and, as he entered
it between two of the trees, he halted and looked about him.

He stood listening for a while. Beyond the faint rustle of leaves no
sound was to be heard. Evidently there was no one about, and, as
Pratt was at large, it was probable that the general was absent.

And now Pembury began to examine the adjacent trees with more than a
casual interest. The two between which he had entered were
respectively an elm and a great pollard oak, the latter being an
immense tree whose huge, warty bole divided about seven feet from the
ground into three limbs, each as large as a fair-sized tree, of which
the largest swept outward in a great curve half-way across the
avenue. On this patriarch Pembury bestowed especial attention,
walking completely round it and finally laying down his bag and cane
(the latter resting on the bag with the ferrule off the ground) that
he might climb up, by the aid of the warty outgrowths, to examine the
crown; and he had just stepped up into the space between the three
limbs, when the creaking of the iron gates was followed by a quick
step in the avenue. Hastily he let himself down from the tree, and,
gathering up his possessions, stood close behind the great bole.

“Just as well not to be seen,” was his reflection, as he hugged the
tree closely and waited, peering cautiously round the trunk. Soon a
streak of moving shadow heralded the stranger’s approach, and he
moved round to keep the trunk between himself and the intruder. On
the footsteps came, until the stranger was abreast of the tree; and
when he had passed Pembury peeped round at the retreating figure. It
was only the postman, but then the man knew him, and he was glad he
had kept out of sight.

Apparently the oak did not meet his requirements, for he stepped out
and looked up and down the avenue. Then, beyond the elm, he caught
sight of an ancient pollard hornbeam--a strange, fantastic tree whose
trunk widened out trumpet-like above into a broad crown, from the
edge of which multitudinous branches uprose like the limbs of some
weird hamadryad.

That tree he approved at a glance, but he lingered behind the oak
until the postman, returning with brisk step and cheerful whistle,
passed down the avenue and left him once more in solitude. Then he
moved on with a resolute air to the hornbeam.

The crown of the trunk was barely six feet from the ground. He could
reach it easily, as he found on trying. Standing the cane against the
tree--ferrule downwards, this time--he took the brush-case from the
bag, pulled off the lid, and, with the crucible-tongs, lifted out the
knife and laid it on the crown of the tree, just out of sight,
leaving the tongs--also invisible--still grasping the knife. He was
about to replace the brush-case in the bag, when he appeared to alter
his mind. Sniffing at it, and finding it reeking with the sickly
perfume, he pushed the lid on again and threw the case up into the
tree, where he heard it roll down into the central hollow of the
crown. Then he closed the bag, and, taking the cane by its handle,
moved slowly away in the direction whence he had come, passing out of
the avenue between the elm and the oak.

His mode of progress was certainly peculiar. He walked with excessive
slowness, trailing the cane along the ground, and every few paces he
would stop and press the ferrule firmly against the earth, so that,
to any one who should have observed him, he would have appeared to be
wrapped in an absorbing reverie.

Thus he moved on across the fields, not, however, returning to the
high road, but crossing another stretch of fields until he emerged
into a narrow lane that led out into the High Street. Immediately
opposite to the lane was the police station, distinguished from the
adjacent cottages only by its lamp, its open door and the notices
pasted up outside. Straight across the road Pembury walked, still
trailing the cane, and halted at the station door to read the
notices, resting his cane on the doorstep as he did so. Through the
open doorway he could see a man writing at a desk. The man’s back was
towards him, but, presently, a movement brought his left hand into
view, and Pembury noted that the forefinger was missing. This, then,
was Jack Ellis, late of the Civil Guard at Portland.

Even while he was looking the man turned his head, and Pembury
recognized him at once. He had frequently met him on the road between
Baysford and the adjoining village of Thorpe, and always at the same
time. Apparently Ellis paid a daily visit to Thorpe--perhaps to
receive a report from the rural constable--and he started between
three and four and returned between seven and a quarter past.

Pembury looked at his watch. It was a quarter past three. He moved
away thoughtfully (holding his cane, now, by the middle), and began
to walk slowly in the direction of Thorpe--westward.

For a while he was deeply meditative, and his face wore a puzzled
frown. Then, suddenly, his face cleared and he strode forward at a
brisker pace. Presently he passed through a gap in the hedge, and,
walking in a field parallel with the road, took out his purse--a
small pigskin pouch. Having frugally emptied it of its contents,
excepting a few shillings, he thrust the ferrule of his cane into the
small compartment ordinarily reserved for gold or notes.

And thus he continued to walk on slowly, carrying the cane by the
middle and the purse jammed on the end.

At length he reached a sharp double curve in the road whence he could
see back for a considerable distance; and here opposite a small
opening, he sat down to wait. The hedge screened him effectually from
the gaze of passers-by--though these were few enough--without
interfering with his view.

A quarter of an hour passed. He began to be uneasy. Had he been
mistaken? Were Ellis’s visits only occasional instead of daily, as he
had thought? That would be tiresome though not actually disastrous.
But at this point in his reflections a figure came into view,
advancing along the road with a steady swing. He recognized the
figure. It was Ellis.

But there was another figure advancing from the opposite direction: a
labourer, apparently. He prepared to shift his ground, but another
glance showed him that the labourer would pass first. He waited. The
labourer came on and, at length, passed the opening, and, as he did
so, Ellis disappeared for a moment in a bend of the road. Instantly
Pembury passed his cane through the opening in the hedge, shook off
the purse and pushed it into the middle of the foot way. Then he
crept forward, behind the hedge, towards the approaching official,
and again sat down to wait. On came the steady tramp of the
unconscious Ellis, and, as it passed, Pembury drew aside an
obstructing branch and peered out at the retreating figure. The
question now was, would Ellis see the purse? It was not a very
conspicuous object.

The footsteps stopped abruptly. Looking out, Pembury saw the police
official stoop, pick up the purse, examine its contents and finally
stow it in his trousers pocket. Pembury heaved a sigh of relief; and,
as the dwindling figure passed out of sight round a curve in the
road, he rose, stretched himself and strode away briskly.

Near the gap was a group of ricks, and, as he passed them, a fresh
idea suggested itself. Looking round quickly he passed to the farther
side of one and, thrusting his cane deeply into it, pushed it home
with a piece of stick that he picked up near the rick, until the
handle was lost among the straw. The bag was now all that was left,
and it was empty--for his other purchases were in the dressing-bag,
which, by the way, he must fetch from the station. He opened it and
smelt the interior, but, though he could detect no odour, he resolved
to be rid of it if possible.

As he emerged from the gap a wagon jogged slowly past. It was piled
high with sacks, and the tail-board was down. Stepping into the road,
he quickly overtook the wagon, and, having glanced round, laid the
bag lightly on the tail-board. Then he set off for the station.

On arriving home he went straight up to his bedroom, and, ringing for
his housekeeper, ordered a substantial meal. Then he took off his
clothes and deposited them, even to his shirt, socks and necktie, in
a trunk, wherein his summer clothing was stored with a plentiful
sprinkling of naphthol to preserve it from the moth. Taking the
packet of permanganate of potash from his dressing-bag, he passed
into the adjoining bathroom, and, tipping the crystals into the bath,
turned on the water. Soon the bath was filled with a pink solution of
the salt, and into this he plunged, immersing his entire body and
thoroughly soaking his hair. Then he emptied the bath and rinsed
himself in clear water, and, having dried himself, returned to the
bedroom and dressed himself in fresh clothing. Finally he took a
hearty meal, and then lay down on the sofa to rest until it should be
time to start for the rendezvous.

Half-past six found him lurking in the shadow by the
station-approach, within sight of the solitary lamp. He heard the
train come in, saw the stream of passengers emerge, and noted one
figure detach itself from the throng and turn on to the Thorpe road.
It was Pratt, as the lamp light showed him; Pratt, striding forward
to the meeting-place with an air of jaunty satisfaction and an
uncommonly creaky pair of boots.

Pembury followed him at a safe distance, and rather by sound than
sight, until he was well past the stile at the entrance to the
footpath. Evidently he was going on to the gates. Then Pembury
vaulted over the stile and strode away swiftly across the dark
meadows.

When he plunged into the deep gloom of the avenue, his first act was
to grope his way to the hornbeam and slip his hand up onto the crown
and satisfy himself that the tongs were as he had left them.
Reassured by the touch of his fingers on the iron loops, he turned
and walked slowly down the avenue. The duplicate knife--ready
opened--was in his left inside breast-pocket, and he fingered its
handle as he walked.

Presently the iron gate squeaked mournfully, and then the rhythmical
creak of a pair of boots was audible, coming up the avenue. Pembury
walked forward slowly until a darker smear emerged from the
surrounding gloom, when he called out----

“Is that you, Pratt?”

“That’s me,” was the cheerful, if ungrammatical response, and, as he
drew nearer, the ex-warder asked: “Have you brought the rhino, old
man?”

The insolent familiarity of the man’s tone was agreeable to Pembury:
it strengthened his nerve and hardened his heart. “Of course,” he
replied; “but we must have a definite understanding, you know.”

“Look here,” said Pratt, “I’ve got no time for jaw. The General will
be here presently; he’s riding over from Bingfield with a friend. You
hand over the dibs and we’ll talk some other time.”

“That is all very well,” said Pembury, “but you must understand----”
He paused abruptly and stood still. They were now close to the
hornbeam, and, as he stood, he stared up into the dark mass of
foliage.

“What’s the matter?” demanded Pratt. “What are you staring at?” He,
too, had halted and stood gazing intently into the darkness.

Then, in an instant, Pembury whipped out the knife and drove it, with
all his strength, into the broad back of the ex-warder, below the
left shoulder-blade.

With a hideous yell Pratt turned and grappled with his assailant. A
powerful man and a competent wrestler, too, he was far more than a
match for Pembury unarmed, and, in a moment, he had him by the
throat. But Pembury clung to him tightly, and, as they trampled to
and fro and round and round, he stabbed again and again with the
viciousness of a Scorpion, while Pratt’s cries grew more gurgling and
husky. Then they fell heavily to the ground, Pembury underneath. But
the struggle was over. With a last bubbling groan, Pratt relaxed his
hold and in a moment grew limp and inert. Pembury pushed him off and
rose, trembling and breathing heavily.

But he wasted no time. There had been more noise than he had
bargained for. Quickly stepping up to the hornbeam, he reached up for
the tongs. His fingers slid into the looped handles; the tongs
grasped the knife, and he lifted it out from its hiding-place and
carried it to where the corpse lay, depositing it on the ground a few
feet from the body. Then he went back to the tree and carefully
pushed the tongs over into the hollow of the crown.

At this moment a woman’s voice sounded shrilly from the top of the
avenue.

“Is that you, Mr. Pratt?” it called.

Pembury started and then stepped back quickly, on tiptoe, to the
body. For there was the duplicate knife. He must take that away at
all costs.

The corpse was lying on its back. The knife was underneath it, driven
in to the very haft. He had to use both hands to lift the body, and
even then he had some difficulty in disengaging the weapon. And,
meanwhile, the voice, repeating its question, drew nearer.

At length he succeeded in drawing out the knife and thrust it into
his breast-pocket. The corpse fell back, and he stood up gasping.

“Mr. Pratt! Are you there?” The nearness of the voice startled
Pembury, and, turning sharply, he saw a light twinkling between the
trees. And then the gates creaked loudly and he heard the crunch of a
horse’s hoofs on the gravel.

He stood for an instant bewildered--utterly taken by surprise. He had
not reckoned on a horse. His intended flight across the meadows
towards Thorpe was now impracticable. If he were overtaken he was
lost, for he knew there was blood on his clothes and his hands were
wet and slippery--to say nothing of the knife in his pocket.

But his confusion lasted only for an instant. He remembered the oak
tree; and, turning out of the avenue, he ran to it, and, touching it
as little as he could with his bloody hands, climbed quickly up into
the crown. The great horizontal limb was nearly three feet in
diameter, and, as he lay out on it, gathering his coat closely round
him, he was quite invisible from below.

He had hardly settled himself when the light which he had seen came
into full view, revealing a woman advancing with a stable lantern in
her hand. And, almost at the same moment, a streak of brighter light
burst from the opposite direction. The horseman was accompanied by a
man on a bicycle.

The two men came on apace, and the horseman, sighting the woman,
called out: “Anything the matter, Mrs. Parton?” But, at that moment,
the light of the bicycle lamp fell full on the prostrate corpse. The
two men uttered a simultaneous cry of horror; the woman shrieked
aloud: and then the horseman sprang from the saddle and ran forward
to the body.

“Why,” he exclaimed, stooping over it, “it’s Pratt;” and, as the
cyclist came up and the glare of his lamp shone on a great pool of
blood, he added: “There’s been foul play here, Hanford.”

Hanford flashed his lamp around the body, lighting up the ground for
several yards.

“What is that behind you, O’Gorman?” he said suddenly; “isn’t it a
knife?” He was moving quickly towards it when O’Gorman held up his
hand.

“Don’t touch it!” he exclaimed. “We’ll put the hounds onto it.
They’ll soon track the scoundrel, whoever he is. By God! Hanford,
this fellow has fairly delivered himself into our hands.” He stood
for a few moments looking down at the knife with something uncommonly
like exultation, and then, turning quickly to his friend, said: “Look
here, Hanford; you ride off to the police station as hard as you can
pelt. It is only three-quarters of a mile; you’ll do it in five
minutes. Send or bring an officer and I’ll scour the meadows
meanwhile. If I haven’t got the scoundrel when you come back, we’ll
put the hounds onto this knife and run the beggar down.”

“Right,” replied Hanford, and without another word he wheeled his
machine about, mounted and rode away into the darkness.

“Mrs. Parton,” said O’Gorman, “watch that knife. See that nobody
touches it while I go and examine the meadows.”

“Is Mr. Pratt dead, sir?” whimpered Mrs. Parton.

“Gad! I hadn’t thought of that,” said the general. “You’d better have
a look at him; but mind! nobody is to touch that knife or they will
confuse the scent.”

He scrambled into the saddle and galloped away across the meadows in
the direction of Thorpe; and, as Pembury listened to the diminuendo
of the horse’s hoofs, he was glad that he had not attempted to
escape; for that was the direction in which he had meant to go, and
he would surely have been overtaken.

As soon as the general was gone, Mrs. Parton, with many a
terror-stricken glance over her shoulder, approached the corpse and
held the lantern close to the dead face. Suddenly she stood up,
trembling violently, for footsteps were audible coming down the
avenue. A familiar voice reassured her.

“Is anything wrong, Mrs. Parton?” The question proceeded from one of
the maids who had come in search of the elder woman, escorted by a
young man, and the pair now came out into the circle of light.

“Good God!” ejaculated the man. “Who’s that?”

“It’s Mr. Pratt,” replied Mrs. Parton. “He’s been murdered.”

The girl screamed, and then the two domestics approached on tiptoe,
staring at the corpse with the fascination of horror.

“Don’t touch that knife,” said Mrs. Parton, for the man was about to
pick it up. “The general’s going to put the bloodhounds onto it.”

“Is the general here, then?” asked the man; and, as he spoke, the
drumming of hoofs, growing momentarily louder, answered him from the
meadow.

O’Gorman reined in his horse as he perceived the group of servants
gathered about the corpse. “Is he dead, Mrs. Parton?” he asked.

“I am afraid so, sir,” was the reply.

“Ha! Somebody ought to go for the doctor; but not you, Bailey. I want
you to get the hounds ready and wait with them at the top of the
avenue until I call you.”

He was off again into the Baysford meadows, and Bailey hurried away,
leaving the two women staring at the body and talking in whispers.

Pembury’s position was cramped and uncomfortable. He dared not move,
hardly dared to breathe, for the women below him were not a dozen
yards away; and it was with mingled feelings of relief and
apprehension that he presently saw from his elevated station a group
of lights approaching rapidly along the road from Baysford. Presently
they were hidden by the trees, and then, after a brief interval, the
whirr of wheels sounded on the drive and streaks of light on the
tree-trunks announced the new arrivals. There were three bicycles,
ridden respectively by Mr. Hanford, a police inspector and a
sergeant; and, as they drew up, the general came thundering back into
the avenue.

“Is Ellis with you?” he asked, as he pulled up.

“No, sir,” was the reply. “He hadn’t come in from Thorpe when we
left. He’s rather late to-night.”

“Have you sent for a doctor?”

“Yes, sir, I’ve sent for Dr. Hills,” said the inspector, resting his
bicycle against the oak. Pembury could smell the reek of the lamp as
he crouched. “Is Pratt dead?”

“Seems to be,” replied O’Gorman, “but we’d better leave that to the
doctor. There’s the murderer’s knife. Nobody has touched it. I’m
going to fetch the bloodhounds now.”

“Ah! that’s the thing,” said the inspector. “The man can’t be far
away.” He rubbed his hands with a satisfied air as O’Gorman cantered
away up the avenue.

In less than a minute there came out from the darkness the deep
baying of a hound followed by quick footsteps on the gravel. Then
into the circle of light emerged three sinister shapes, loose-limbed
and gaunt, and two men advancing at a shambling trot.

“Here, inspector,” shouted the general, “you take one; I can’t hold
‘em both.”

The inspector ran forward and seized one of the leashes, and the
general led his hound up to the knife, as it lay on the ground.
Pembury, peering cautiously round the bough, watched the great brute
with almost impersonal curiosity; noted its high poll, its wrinkled
forehead and melancholy face as it stooped to snuff suspiciously at
the prostrate knife.

For some moments the hound stood motionless, sniffing at the knife;
then it turned away and walked to and fro with its muzzle to the
ground. Suddenly it lifted its head, bayed loudly, lowered its muzzle
and started forward between the oak and the elm, dragging the general
after it at a run.

The inspector next brought his hound to the knife, and was soon
bounding away to the tug of the leash in the general’s wake.

“They don’t make no mistakes, they don’t,” said Bailey, addressing
the gratified sergeant, as he brought forward the third hound;
“you’ll see--” But his remark was cut short by a violent jerk of the
leash, and the next moment he was flying after the others, followed
by Mr. Hanford.

The sergeant daintily picked the knife up by its ring, wrapped it in
his handkerchief and bestowed it in his pocket. Then he ran off after
the hounds.

Pembury smiled grimly. His scheme was working out admirably in spite
of the unforeseen difficulties. If those confounded women would only
go away, he could come down and take himself off while the course was
clear. He listened to the baying of the hounds, gradually growing
fainter in the increasing distance, and cursed the dilatoriness of
the doctor. Confound the fellow! Didn’t he realize that this was a
case of life or death?

Suddenly his ear caught the tinkle of a bicycle bell; a fresh light
appeared coming up the avenue and then a bicycle swept up swiftly to
the scene of the tragedy, and a small elderly man jumped down by the
side of the body. Giving his machine to Mrs. Parton, he stooped over
the dead man, felt the wrist, pushed back an eyelid, held a match to
the eye and then rose. “This is a shocking affair, Mrs. Parton,” said
he. “The poor fellow is quite dead. You had better help me to carry
him to the house. If you two take the feet I will take the shoulders.”

Pembury watched them raise the body and stagger away with it up the
avenue. He heard their shuffling steps die away and the door of the
house shut. And still he listened. From far away in the meadows came,
at intervals, the baying of the hounds. Other sounds there was none.
Presently the doctor would come back for his bicycle, but, for the
moment, the coast was clear. Pembury rose stiffly. His hands had
stuck to the tree where they had pressed against it, and they were
still sticky and damp. Quickly he let himself down to the ground,
listened again for a moment, and then, making a small circuit to
avoid the lamplight, softly crossed the avenue and stole away across
the Thorpe meadows.

The night was intensely dark, and not a soul was stirring in the
meadows. He strode forward quickly, peering into the darkness and
stopping now and again to listen; but no sound came to his ears, save
the now faint baying of the distant hounds. Not far from his house,
he remembered, was a deep ditch spanned by a wooden bridge, and
towards this he now made his way; for he knew that his appearance was
such as to convict him at a glance. Arrived at the ditch, he stooped
to wash his hands and wrists; and, as he bent forward, the knife fell
from his breast-pocket into the shallow water at the margin. He
groped for it, and, having found it, drove it deep into the mud as
far out as he could reach. Then he wiped his hands on some
water-weed, crossed the bridge and started homewards.

He approached his house from the rear, satisfied himself that his
housekeeper was in the kitchen, and, letting himself in very quietly
with his key, went quickly up to his bedroom. Here he washed
thoroughly--in the bath, so that he could get rid of the discoloured
water--changed his clothes and packed those that he took off in a
portmanteau.

By the time he had done this the gong sounded for supper. As he took
his seat at the table, spruce and fresh in appearance, quietly
cheerful in manner, he addressed his house keeper. “I wasn’t able to
finish my business in London,” he said. “I shall have to go up again
tomorrow.”

“Shall you come home the same day?” asked the housekeeper.

“Perhaps,” was the reply, “and perhaps not. It will depend on
circumstances.”

He did not say what the circumstances might be, nor did the
housekeeper ask. Mr. Pembury was not addicted to confidences. He was
an eminently discreet man: and discreet men say little.


PART II

RIVAL SLEUTH-HOUNDS

(_Related by Christopher Jervis, M.D._)

The half-hour that follows breakfast, when the fire has, so to speak,
got into its stride, and the morning pipe throws up its clouds of
incense, is, perhaps, the most agreeable in the whole day. Especially
so when a sombre sky, brooding over the town, hints at streets
pervaded by the chilly morning air, and hoots from protesting tugs
upon the river tell of lingering mists, the legacy of the
lately-vanished night.

The autumn morning was raw: the fire burned jovially. I thrust my
slippered feet towards the blaze and meditated, on nothing in
particular, with catlike enjoyment. Presently a disapproving grunt
from Thorndyke attracted my attention, and I looked round lazily. He
was extracting, with a pair of office shears, the readable portions
of the morning paper, and had paused with a small cutting between his
finger and thumb. “Bloodhounds again,” said he. “We shall be hearing
presently of the revival of the ordeal by fire.”

“And a deuced comfortable ordeal, too, on a morning like this,” I
said, stroking my legs ecstatically. “What is the case?”

He was about to reply when a sharp rat-tat from the little brass
knocker announced a disturber of our peace. Thorndyke stepped over to
the door and admitted a police inspector in uniform, and I stood up,
and, presenting my dorsal aspect to the fire, prepared to combine
bodily comfort with attention to business.

“I believe I am speaking to Dr. Thorndyke,” said the officer, and, as
Thorndyke nodded, he went on: “My name, sir, is Fox, Inspector Fox of
the Baysford Police. Perhaps you’ve seen the morning paper?”

Thorndyke held up the cutting, and, placing a chair by the fire,
asked the inspector if he had breakfasted.

“Thank you, sir, I have,” replied Inspector Fox. “I came up to town
by the late train last night so as to be here early, and stayed at an
hotel. You see, from the paper, that we have had to arrest one of our
own men. That’s rather awkward, you know, sir.”

“Very,” agreed Thorndyke.

“Yes; it’s bad for the force and bad for the public too. But we had
to do it. There was no way out that we could see. Still, we should
like the accused to have every chance, both for our sake and his own,
so the chief constable thought he’d like to have your opinion on the
case, and he thought that, perhaps, you might be willing to act for
the defence.”

“Let us have the particulars,” said Thorndyke, taking a writing-pad
from a drawer and dropping into his armchair. “Begin at the
beginning,” he added, “and tell us all you know.”

“Well,” said the inspector, after a preliminary cough, “to begin with
the murdered man: his name is Pratt. He was a retired prison warder,
and was employed as steward by General O’Gorman, who is a retired
prison governor--you may have heard of him in connection with his
pack of blood hounds. Well, Pratt came down from London yesterday
evening by a train arriving at Baysford at six-thirty. He was seen by
the guard, the ticket collector and the outside porter. The porter
saw him leave the station at six-thirty-seven. General O’Gorman’s
house is about half-a-mile from the station. At five minutes to seven
the general and a gentleman named Hanford and the general’s
housekeeper, a Mrs. Parton, found Pratt lying dead in the avenue that
leads up to the house. He had apparently been stabbed, for there was
a lot of blood about, and a knife--a Norwegian knife--was lying on
the ground near the body. Mrs. Parton had thought she heard some one
in the avenue calling out for help, and, as Pratt was just due, she
came out with a lantern. She met the general and Mr. Hanford, and all
three seem to have caught sight of the body at the same moment. Mr.
Hanford cycled down to us, at once, with the news; we sent for a
doctor, and I went back with Mr. Hanford and took a sergeant with me.
We arrived at twelve minutes past seven, and then the general, who
had galloped his horse over the meadows each side of the avenue
without having seen anybody, fetched out his bloodhounds and led them
up to the knife. All three hounds took up the scent at once--I held
the leash of one of them--and they took us across the meadows without
a pause or a falter, over stiles and fences, along a lane, out into
the town, and then, one after the other, they crossed the road in a
bee-line to the police station, bolted in at the door, which stood
open, and made straight for the desk, where a supernumerary officer,
named Ellis, was writing. They made a rare to-do, struggling to get
at him, and it was as much as we could manage to hold them back. As
for Ellis, he turned as pale as a ghost.”

“Was any one else in the room?” asked Thorndyke.

“Oh, yes. There were two constables and a messenger. We led the
hounds up to them, but the brutes wouldn’t take any notice of them.
They wanted Ellis.”

“And what did you do?”

“Why, we arrested Ellis, of course. Couldn’t do anything
else--especially with the general there.”

“What had the general to do with it?” asked Thorndyke.

“He’s a J.P. and a late governor of Dartmoor, and it was his hounds
that had run the man down. But we must have arrested Ellis in any
case.”

“Is there anything against the accused man?”

“Yes, there is. He and Pratt were on distinctly unfriendly terms.
They were old comrades, for Ellis was in the Civil Guard at Portland
when Pratt was warder there--he was pensioned off from the service
because he got his left forefinger chopped off--but lately they had
had some unpleasantness about a woman, a parlourmaid of the
general’s. It seems that Ellis, who is a married man, paid the girl
too much attention--or Pratt thought he did--and Pratt warned Ellis
off the premises. Since then they had not been on speaking terms.”

“And what sort of a man is Ellis?”

“A remarkably decent fellow he always seemed; quiet, steady,
good-natured; I should have said he wouldn’t have hurt a fly. We all
liked him--better than we liked Pratt, in fact; poor Pratt was what
you’d call an old soldier--sly, you know, sir--and a bit of a sneak.”

“You searched and examined Ellis, of course?”

“Yes. There was nothing suspicious about him except that he had two
purses. But he says he picked up one of them--a small, pigskin
pouch--on the footpath of the Thorpe road yesterday afternoon; and
there’s no reason to disbelieve him. At any rate, the purse was not
Pratt’s.”

Thorndyke made a note on his pad, and then asked: “There were no
bloodstains or marks on his clothing?”

“No. His clothing was not marked or disarranged in any way.”

“Any cuts, scratches or bruises on his person?”

“None whatever,” replied the inspector.

“At what time did you arrest Ellis?”

“Half-past seven exactly.”

“Have you ascertained what his movements were? Had he been near the
scene of the murder?”

“Yes; he had been to Thorpe and would pass the gates of the avenue on
his way back. And he was later than usual in returning, though not
later than he has often been before.”

“And now, as to the murdered man: has the body been examined?”

“Yes; I had Dr. Hills’s report before I left. There were no less than
seven deep knife-wounds, all on the left side of the back. There was
a great deal of blood on the ground, and Dr. Hills thinks Pratt must
have bled to death in a minute or two.”

“Do the wounds correspond with the knife that was found?”

“I asked the doctor that, and he said ‘Yes,’ though he wasn’t going
to swear to any particular knife. However, that point isn’t of much
importance. The knife was covered with blood, and it was found close
to the body.”

“What has been done with it, by the way?” asked Thorndyke.

“The sergeant who was with me picked it up and rolled it in his
handkerchief to carry in his pocket. I took it from him, just as it
was, and locked it in a dispatch-box.”

“Has the knife been recognized as Ellis’s property?”

“No, sir, it has not.”

“Were there any recognizable footprints or marks of a struggle?”
Thorndyke asked.

The inspector grinned sheepishly. “I haven’t examined the spot, of
course, sir,” said he, “but, after the general’s horse and the
bloodhounds and the general on foot and me and the gardener and the
sergeant and Mr. Hanford had been over it twice, going and returning,
why, you see, sir----

“Exactly, exactly,” said Thorndyke. “Well, inspector, I shall be
pleased to act for the defence; it seems to me that the case against
Ellis is in some respects rather inconclusive.”

The inspector was frankly amazed. “It certainly hadn’t struck me in
that light, sir,” he said.

“No? Well, that is my view; and I think the best plan will be for me
to come down with you and investigate matters on the spot.”

The inspector assented cheerfully, and, when we had provided him with
a newspaper, we withdrew to the laboratory to consult time-tables and
prepare for the expedition.

“You are coming, I suppose, Jervis?” said Thorndyke.

“If I shall be of any use,” I replied.

“Of course you will,” said he. “Two heads are better than one, and,
by the look of things, I should say that ours will be the only ones
with any sense in them. We will take the research case, of course,
and we may as well have a camera with us. I see there is a train from
Charing Cross in twenty minutes.”

For the first half-hour of the journey Thorndyke sat in his corner,
alternately conning over his notes and gazing with thoughtful eyes
out of the window. I could see that the case pleased him, and was
careful not to break in upon his train of thought. Presently,
however, he put away his notes and began to fill his pipe with a more
companionable air, and then the inspector, who had been wriggling
with impatience, opened fire.

“So you think, sir, that you see a way out for Ellis?”

“I think there is a case for the defence,” replied Thorndyke. “In
fact, I call the evidence against him rather flimsy.”

The inspector gasped. “But the knife, sir? What about the knife?”

“Well,” said Thorndyke, “what about the knife? Whose knife was it?
You don’t know. It was covered with blood. Whose blood? You don’t
know. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that it was the
murderer’s knife. Then the blood on it was Pratt’s blood. But if it
was Pratt’s blood, when the hounds had smelt it they should have led
you to Pratt’s body, for blood gives a very strong scent. But they
did not. They ignored the body. The inference seems to be that the
blood on the knife was not Pratt’s blood.”

The inspector took off his cap and gently scratched the back of his
head. “You’re perfectly right, sir,” he said. “I’d never thought of
that. None of us had.”

“Then,” pursued Thorndyke, “let us assume that the knife was Pratt’s.
If so, it would seem to have been used in self-defence. But this was
a Norwegian knife, a clumsy tool--not a weapon at all--which takes an
appreciable time to open and requires the use of two free hands. Now,
had Pratt both hands free? Certainly not after the attack had
commenced. There were seven wounds, all on the left side of the back;
which indicates that he held the murderer locked in his arms and that
the murderer’s arms were around him. Also, incidentally, that the
murderer is right-handed. But, still, let us assume that the knife
was Pratt’s. Then the blood on it was that of the murderer. Then the
murderer must have been wounded. But Ellis was not wounded. Then
Ellis is not the murderer. The knife doesn’t help us at all.”

The inspector puffed out his cheeks and blew softly. “This is getting
out of my depth,” he said. “Still, sir, you can’t get over the
bloodhounds. They tell us distinctly that the knife is Ellis’s knife
and I don’t see any answer to that.”

“There is no answer because there has been no statement. The
bloodhounds have told you nothing. You have drawn certain inferences
from their actions, but those inferences may be totally wrong and
they are certainly not evidence.”

“You don’t seem to have much opinion of bloodhounds,” the inspector
remarked.

“As agents for the detection of crime,” replied Thorndyke, “I regard
them as useless. You cannot put a bloodhound in the witness-box. You
can get no intelligible statement from it. If it possesses any
knowledge, it has no means of communicating it. The fact is,” he
continued, “that the entire system of using bloodhounds for criminal
detection is based on a fallacy. In the American plantations these
animals were used with great success for tracking runaway slaves. But
the slave was a known individual. All that was required was to
ascertain his whereabouts. That is not the problem that is presented
in the detection of a crime. The detective is not concerned in
establishing the whereabouts of a known individual, but in
discovering the identity of an unknown individual. And for this
purpose bloodhounds are useless. They may discover such identity, but
they cannot communicate their knowledge. If the criminal is unknown
they cannot identify him: if he is known, the police have no need of
the bloodhound.

“To return to our present case,” Thorndyke resumed, after a pause;
“we have employed certain agents--the hounds--with whom we are not
_en rapport_, as the spiritualists would say; and we have no
‘medium.’ The hound possesses a special sense--the olfactory--which
in man is quite rudimentary. He thinks, so to speak, in terms of
smell, and his thoughts are untranslatable to beings in whom the
sense of smell is undeveloped. We have presented to the hound a
knife, and he discovers in it certain odorous properties; he
discovers similar or related odorous properties in a tract of land
and a human individual--Ellis. We cannot verify his discoveries or
ascertain their nature. What remains? All that we can say is that
there appears to exist some odorous relation between the knife and
the man Ellis. But until we can ascertain the nature of that
relation, we cannot estimate its evidential value or bearing. All the
other ‘evidence’ is the product of your imagination and that of the
general. There is, at present, no case against Ellis.”

“He must have been pretty close to the place when the murder
happened,” said the inspector.

“So, probably, were many other people,” answered Thorndyke; “but had
he time to wash and change? Because he would have needed it.”

“I suppose he would,” the inspector agreed dubiously.

“Undoubtedly. There were seven wounds which would have taken some
time to inflict. Now we can’t suppose that Pratt stood passively
while the other man stabbed him--indeed, as I have said, the position
of the wounds shows that he did not. There was a struggle. The two
men were locked together. One of the murderer’s hands was against
Pratt’s back; probably both hands were, one clasping and the other
stabbing. There must have been blood on one hand and probably on
both. But you say there was no blood on Ellis, and there doesn’t seem
to have been time or opportunity for him to wash.”

“Well, it’s a mysterious affair,” said the inspector; “but I don’t
see how you are going to get over the bloodhounds.”

Thorndyke shrugged his shoulders impatiently. “The bloodhounds are an
obsession,” he said. “The whole problem really centres around the
knife. The questions are, Whose knife was it? and what was the
connection between it and Ellis? There is a problem, Jervis,” he
continued, turning to me, “that I submit for your consideration. Some
of the possible solutions are exceedingly curious.”

As we set out from Baysford station, Thorndyke looked at his watch
and noted the time. “You will take us the way that Pratt went,” he
said.

“As to that,” said the inspector, “he may have gone by the road or by
the footpath; but there’s very little difference in the distance.”

Turning away from Baysford, we walked along the road westward,
towards the village of Thorpe, and presently passed on our right a
stile at the entrance to a footpath.

“That path,” said the inspector, “crosses the avenue about half-way
up. But we’d better keep to the road.” A quarter of a mile further on
we came to a pair of rusty iron gates one of which stood open, and,
entering, we found ourselves in a broad drive bordered by two rows of
trees, between the trunks of which a long stretch of pasture meadows
could be seen on either hand. It was a fine avenue, and, late in the
year as it was, the yellowing foliage clustered thickly overhead.

When we had walked about a hundred and fifty yards from the gates,
the inspector halted.

“This is the place,” he said; and Thorndyke again noted the time.

“Nine minutes exactly,” said he. “Then Pratt arrived here about
fourteen minutes to seven, and his body was found at five minutes to
seven--nine minutes after his arrival. The murderer couldn’t have
been far away then.”

“No, it was a pretty fresh scent,” replied the inspector. “You’d like
to see the body first, I think you said, sir?”

“Yes; and the knife, if you please.”

“I shall have to send down to the station for that. It’s locked up in
the office.”

He entered the house, and, having dispatched a messenger to the
police station, came out and conducted us to the outbuilding where
the corpse had been deposited. Thorndyke made a rapid examination of
the wounds and the holes in the clothing, neither of which presented
anything particularly suggestive. The weapon used had evidently been
a thick-backed, single-edged knife similar to the one described, and
the discolouration around the wounds indicated that the weapon had a
definite shoulder like that of a Norwegian knife, and that it had
been driven in with savage violence.

“Do you find anything that throws any light on the case?” the
inspector asked, when the examination was concluded.

“That is impossible to say until we have seen the knife,” replied
Thorndyke; “but while we are waiting for it, we may as well go and
look at the scene of the tragedy. These are Pratt’s boots, I think?”
He lifted a pair of stout laced boots from the table and turned them
up to inspect the soles.

“Yes, those are his boots,” replied Fox, “and pretty easy they’d have
been to track, if the case had been the other way about. Those
Blakey’s protectors are as good as a trademark.”

“We’ll take them, at any rate,” said Thorndyke; and, the inspector
having taken the boots from him, we went out and retraced our steps
down the avenue.

The place where the murder had occurred was easily identified by a
large dark stain on the gravel at one side of the drive, half-way
between two trees--an ancient pollard hornbeam and an elm. Next to
the elm was a pollard oak with a squat, warty bole about seven feet
high, and three enormous limbs, of which one slanted half-way across
the avenue; and between these two trees the ground was covered with
the tracks of men and hounds superimposed upon the hoof-prints of a
horse.

“Where was the knife found?” Thorndyke asked.

The inspector indicated a spot near the middle of the drive, almost
opposite the hornbeam and Thorndyke, picking up a large stone, laid
it on the spot. Then he surveyed the Scene thoughtfully, looking up
and down the drive and at the trees that bordered it, and, finally,
walked slowly to the space between the elm and the oak, scanning the
ground as he went. “There is no dearth of footprints,” he remarked
grimly, as he looked down at the trampled earth.

“No, but the question is, whose are they?” said the inspector.

“Yes, that is the question,” agreed Thorndyke; “and we will begin the
solution by identifying those of Pratt.”

“I don’t see how that will help us,” said the inspector. “We know he
was here.”

Thorndyke looked at him in surprise, and I must confess that the
foolish remark astonished me too, accustomed as I was to the
quick-witted officers from Scotland Yard.

“The hue and cry procession,” remarked Thorndyke, “seems to have
passed out between the elm and the oak; elsewhere the ground seems
pretty clear.” He walked round the elm, still looking earnestly at
the ground, and presently continued: “Now here, in the soft earth
bordering the turf, are the prints of a pair of smallish feet wearing
pointed boots; a rather short man, evidently, by the size of foot and
length of stride, and he doesn’t seem to have belonged to the
procession. But I don’t see any of Pratt’s; he doesn’t seem to have
come off the hard gravel.” He continued to walk slowly towards the
hornbeam with his eyes fixed on the ground. Suddenly he halted and
stooped with an eager look at the earth; and, as Fox and I
approached, he stood up and pointed. “Pratt’s footprints--faint and
fragmentary, but unmistakable. And now, inspector, you see their
importance. They furnish the time factor in respect of the other foot
prints. Look at this one and then look at that.” He pointed from one
to another of the faint impressions of the dead man’s foot.

“You mean that there are signs of a struggle?” said Fox.

“I mean more than that,” replied Thorndyke. “Here is one of Pratt’s
footprints treading into the print of a small, pointed foot; and
there at the edge of the gravel is another of Pratt’s nearly
obliterated by the tread of a pointed foot. Obviously the first
pointed footprint was made before Pratt’s, and the second one after
his; and the necessary inference is that the owner of the pointed
foot was here at the same time as Pratt.”

“Then he must have been the murderer!” exclaimed Fox.

“Presumably,” answered Thorndyke; “but let us see whither he went.
You notice, in the first place, that the man stood close to this
tree”--he indicated the hornbeam--“and that he went towards the elm.
Let us follow him. He passes the elm, you see, and you will observe
that these tracks form a regular series leading from the hornbeam and
not mixed up with the marks of the struggle. They were, therefore,
probably made after the murder had been perpetrated. You will also
notice that they pass along the backs of the trees--outside the
avenue, that is; what does that suggest to you?”

“It suggests to me,” I said, when the inspector had shaken his head
hopelessly, “that there was possibly some one in the avenue when the
man was stealing off.”

“Precisely,” said Thorndyke. “The body was found not more than nine
minutes after Pratt arrived here. But the murder must have taken some
time. Then the housekeeper thought she heard some one calling and
came out with a lantern, and, at the same time, the general and Mr.
Hanford came up the drive. The suggestion is that the man sneaked
along outside the trees to avoid being seen. However, let us follow
the tracks. They pass the elm and they pass on behind the next tree;
but wait! There is something odd here.” He passed behind the great
pollard oak and looked down at the soft earth by its roots. “Here is
a pair of impressions much deeper than the rest, and they are not a
part of the track since their toes point towards the tree. What do
you make of that?” Without waiting for an answer he began closely to
scan the bole of the tree and especially a large, warty protuberance
about three feet from the ground. On the bark above this was a
vertical mark, as if something had scraped down the tree, and from
the wart itself a dead twig had been newly broken off and lay upon
the ground. Pointing to these marks Thorndyke set his foot on the
protuberance, and, springing up, brought his eye above the level of
the crown, whence the great boughs branched off.

“Ah!” he exclaimed. “Here is something much more definite.” With the
aid of another projection, he scrambled up into the crown of the
tree, and, having glanced quickly round, beckoned to us. I stepped up
on the projecting lump and, as my eyes rose above the crown, I
perceived the brown, shiny impression of a hand on the edge. Climbing
into the crown, I was quickly followed by the inspector, and we both
stood up by Thorndyke between the three boughs. From where we stood
we looked on the upper side of the great limb that swept out across
the avenue; and there on its lichen-covered surface, we saw the
imprints in reddish-brown of a pair of open hands.

“You notice,” said Thorndyke, leaning out upon the bough, “that he is
a short man; I cannot conveniently place my hands so low. You also
note that he has both forefingers intact, and so is certainly not
Ellis.”

“If you mean to say, sir, that these marks were made by the
murderer,” said Fox, “I say it’s impossible. Why, that would mean
that he was here looking down at us when we were searching for him
with the hounds. The presence of the hounds proves that this man
could not have been the murderer.”

“On the contrary,” said Thorndyke, “the presence of this man with
bloody hands confirms the other evidence, which all indicates that
the hounds were never on the murderer’s trail at all. Come now,
inspector, I put it to you: Here is a murdered man; the murderer has
almost certainly blood upon his hands; and here is a man with bloody
hands, lurking in a tree within a few feet of the corpse and within a
few minutes of its discovery (as is shown by the footprints); what
are the reasonable probabilities?”

“But you are forgetting the bloodhounds, sir, and the murderer’s
knife,” urged the inspector.

“Tut, tut, man!” exclaimed Thorndyke; “those blood hounds are a
positive obsession. But I see a sergeant coming up the drive, with
the knife, I hope. Perhaps that will solve the riddle for us.”

The sergeant, who carried a small dispatch-box, halted opposite the
tree in some surprise while we descended, when he came forward with a
military salute and handed the box to the inspector, who forthwith
unlocked it, and, opening the lid, displayed an object wrapped in a
pocket-handkerchief.

“There is the knife, sir,” said he, “just as I received it. The
handkerchief is the sergeant’s.”

Thorndyke unrolled the handkerchief and took from it a large-sized
Norwegian knife, which he looked at critically and then handed to me.
While I was inspecting the blade, he, shook out the handkerchief and,
having looked it over on both sides, turned to the sergeant.

“At what time did you pick up this knife?” he asked.

“About seven-fifteen, sir; directly after the hounds had started. I
was careful to pick it up by the ring, and I wrapped it in the
handkerchief at once.”

“Seven-fifteen,” said Thorndyke. “Less than half-an-hour after the
murder. That is very singular. Do you observe the state of this
handkerchief? There is not a mark on it. Not a trace of any
bloodstain; which proves that when the knife was picked up, the blood
on it was already dry. But things dry slowly, if they dry at all, in
the saturated air of an autumn evening. The appearances seem to
suggest that the blood on the knife was dry when it was thrown down.
By the way, sergeant, what do you scent your handkerchief with?’”

“Scent, sir!” exclaimed the astonished officer in indignant accents;
“me scent my handkerchief! No, sir, certainly not. Never used scent
in my life, sir.”

Thorndyke held out the handkerchief, and the sergeant Sniffed at it
incredulously. “It certainly does seem to smell of scent,” he
admitted, “but it must be the knife.” The same idea having occurred
to me, I applied the handle of the knife to my nose and instantly
detected the sickly-sweet odour of musk.

“The question is,” said the inspector, when the two articles had been
tested by us all, “was it the knife that scented the handkerchief or
the handkerchief that scented the knife?”

“You heard what the sergeant said,” replied Thorndyke. “There was no
scent on the handkerchief when the knife was wrapped in it. Do you
know, inspector, this scent seems to me to offer a very curious
suggestion. Consider the facts of the case: the distinct trail
leading straight to Ellis, who is, nevertheless, found to be without
a scratch or a spot of blood; the inconsistencies in the case that I
pointed out in the train, and now this knife, apparently dropped with
dried blood on it and scented with musk. To me it suggests a
carefully-planned, coolly-premeditated crime. The murderer knew about
the general’s bloodhounds and made use of them as a blind. He planted
this knife, smeared with blood and tainted with musk, to furnish a
scent. No doubt some object, also scented with musk, would be drawn
over the ground to give the trail. It is only a suggestion, of
course, but it is worth considering.”

“But, sir,” the inspector objected eagerly, “if the murderer had
handled the knife, it would have scented him too.”

“Exactly; so, as we are assuming that the man is not a fool, we may
assume that he did not handle it. He will have left it here in
readiness, hidden in some place whence he could knock it down, say,
with a stick, without touching it.”

“Perhaps in this very tree, sir,” suggested the sergeant, pointing to
the oak.

“No,” said Thorndyke, “he would hardly have hidden in the tree where
the knife had been. The hounds might have scented the place instead
of following the trail at once. The most likely hiding-place for the
knife is the one nearest the spot where it was found.” He walked over
to the stone that marked the spot, and looking round, continued: “You
see, that hornbeam is much the nearest, and its flat crown would be
very convenient for the purpose--easily reached even by a short man,
as he appears to be. Let us see if there are any traces of it.
Perhaps you will give me a ‘back up,’ sergeant, as we haven’t a
ladder.”

The sergeant assented with a faint grin, and stooping beside the tree
in an attitude suggesting the game of leap frog, placed his hands
firmly on his knees. Grasping a stout branch, Thorndyke swung himself
up on the Sergeant’s broad back, whence he looked down into the crown
of the tree. Then, parting the branches, he stepped onto the ledge
and disappeared into the central hollow.

When he reappeared he held in his hands two very singular objects: a
pair of iron crucible-tongs and an artist’s brush-case of
black-japanned tin. The former article he handed down to me, but the
brush-case he held carefully by its wire handle as he dropped to the
ground.

“The significance of these things is, I think, obvious,” he said.
“The tongs were used to handle the knife with and the case to carry
it in, so that it should not scent his clothes or bag. It was very
carefully planned.”

“If that is so,” said the inspector, “the inside of the case ought to
smell of musk.”

“No doubt,” said Thorndyke; “but before we open it, there is a rather
important matter to be attended to. Will you give me the Vitogen
powder, Jervis?”

I opened the canvas-covered “research case” and took from it an
object like a diminutive pepper-caster--an iodoform dredger in
fact--and handed it to him. Grasping the brush-case by its wire
handle, he sprinkled the pale yellow powder from the dredger freely
all round the pulloff lid, tapping the top with his knuckles to make
the fine particles spread. Then he blew off the superfluous powder,
and the two police officers gave a simultaneous gasp of joy; for now,
on the black background, there stood out plainly a number of
finger-prints, so clear and distinct that the ridge-pattern could be
made out with perfect ease.

“These will probably be his right hand,” said Thorndyke.

“Now for the left.” He treated the body of the case in the same way,
and, when he had blown off the powder, the entire surface was spotted
with yellow, oval impressions. “Now, Jervis,” said he, “if you will
put on a glove and pull off the lid, we can test the inside.”

There was no difficulty in getting the lid off, for the shoulder of
the case had been smeared with vaseline--apparently to produce an
airtight joint--and, as it separated with a hollow sound, a faint,
musky odour exhaled from its interior.

“The remainder of the inquiry,” said Thorndyke, when I pushed the lid
on again, “will be best conducted at the police station, where, also,
we can photograph these finger prints.”

“The shortest way will be across the meadows,” said Fox; “the way the
hounds went.”

By this route we accordingly travelled, Thorndyke carrying the
brush-case tenderly by its handle.

“I don’t quite see where Ellis comes in in this job,” said the
inspector, as we walked along, “if the fellow had a grudge against
Pratt. They weren’t chums.”

“I think I do,” said Thorndyke. “You say that both men were prison
officers at Portland at the same time. Now doesn’t it seem likely
that this is the work of some old convict who had been
identified--and perhaps blackmailed--by Pratt, and possibly by Ellis
too? That is where the value of the finger-prints comes in. If he is
an old ‘lag’ his prints will be at Scotland Yard. Otherwise they are
not of much value as a clue.”

“That’s true, sir,” said the inspector. “I suppose you want to see
Ellis.”

“I want to see that purse that you spoke of, first,” replied
Thorndyke. “That is probably the other end of the clue.”

As soon as we arrived at the station, the inspector unlocked a safe
and brought out a parcel. “These are Ellis’s things,” said he, as he
unfastened it, “and that is the purse.”

He handed Thorndyke a small pigskin pouch, which my colleague opened,
and having smelt the inside, passed to me. The odour of musk was
plainly perceptible, especially in the small compartment at the back.

“It has probably tainted the other contents of the parcel,” said
Thorndyke, sniffing at each article in turn, “but my sense of smell
is not keen enough to detect any scent. They all seem odourless to
me, whereas the purse smells quite distinctly. Shall we have Ellis in
now?”

The sergeant took a key from a locked drawer and de parted for the
cells, whence he presently reappeared accompanied by the prisoner--a
stout, burly man, in the last stage of dejection.

“Come, cheer up, Ellis,” said the inspector. “Here’s Dr. Thorndyke
come down to help us and he wants to ask you one or two questions.”

Ellis looked piteously at Thorndyke, and exclaimed: “I know nothing
whatever about this affair, sir, I swear to God I don’t.”

“I never supposed you did,” said Thorndyke. “But there are one or two
things that I want you to tell me. To begin with, that purse: where
did you find it?”

“On the Thorpe road, sir. It was lying in the middle of the footway.”

“Had any one else passed the spot lately? Did you meet or pass any
one?”

“Yes, sir, I met a labourer about a minute before I saw the purse. I
can’t imagine why he didn’t see it.”

“Probably because it wasn’t there,” said Thorndyke. “Is there a hedge
there?”

“Yes, sir; a hedge on a low bank.”

“Ha! Well, now, tell me: is there any one about here whom you knew
when you and Pratt were together at Portland? Any old lag--to put it
bluntly--whom you and Pratt have been putting the screw on.”

“No, sir, I swear there isn’t. But I wouldn’t answer for Pratt. He
had a rare memory for faces.”

Thorndyke reflected. “Were there any escapes from Portland in your
time?” he asked.

“Only one--a man named Dobbs. He made off to the Sea in a sudden fog
and he was supposed to be drowned. His clothes washed up on the Bill,
but not his body. At any rate, he was never heard of again.”

“Thank you, Ellis. Do you mind my taking your finger prints?”

“Certainly, not, sir,” was the almost eager reply; and the office
inking-pad being requisitioned, a rough set of finger-prints was
produced; and when Thorndyke had compared them with those on the
brush-case and found no resemblance, Ellis returned to his cell in
quite buoyant spirits.

Having made several photographs of the strange finger-prints, we
returned to town that evening, taking the negatives with us; and
while we waited for our train, Thorndyke gave a few parting
injunctions to the inspector. “Remember,” he said, “that the man must
have washed his hands before he could appear in public. Search the
banks of every pond, ditch and stream in the neighbourhood for
footprints like those in the avenue; and, if you find any, search the
bottom of the water thoroughly, for he is quite likely to have
dropped the knife into the mud.”

The photographs, which we handed in at Scotland Yard that same night,
enabled the experts to identify the finger prints as those of Francis
Dobbs, an escaped convict. The two photographs--profile and
full-face--which were attached to his record, were sent down to
Baysford with a description of the man, and were, in due course,
identified with a somewhat mysterious individual, who passed by the
name of Rufus Pembury and who had lived in the neighbourhood as a
private gentleman for some two years. But Rufus Pembury was not to be
found either at his genteel house or elsewhere. All that was known
was, that on the day after the murder, he had converted his entire
“personalty” into “bearer securities,” and then vanished from mortal
ken. Nor has he ever been heard of to this day.

“And, between ourselves,” said Thorndyke, when we were discussing the
case some time after, “he deserved to escape. It was clearly a case
of blackmail, and to kill a blackmailer--when you have no other
defence against him--is hardly murder. As to Ellis, he could never
have been convicted, and Dobbs, or Pembury, must have known it. But
he would have been committed to the Assizes, and that would have
given time for all traces to disappear. No, Dobbs was a man of
courage, ingenuity and resource; and, above all, he knocked the
bottom out of the great bloodhound superstition.”




THE ECHO OF A MUTINY


PART I

DEATH ON THE GIRDLER

Popular belief ascribes to infants and the lower animals certain
occult powers of divining character denied to the reasoning faculties
of the human adult; and is apt to accept their judgment as finally
overriding the pronouncements of mere experience.

Whether this belief rests upon any foundation other than the
universal love of paradox it is unnecessary to inquire. It is very
generally entertained, especially by ladies of a certain social
status; and by Mrs. Thomas Solly it was loyally maintained as an
article of faith.

“Yes,” she moralized, “it’s surprisin’ how they know, the little
children and the dumb animals. But they do. There’s no deceivin’
_them_. They can tell the gold from the dross in a moment, they can,
and they reads the human heart like a book. Wonderful, I call it. I
suppose it’s instinct.”

Having delivered herself of this priceless gem of philosophic
thought, she thrust her arms elbow-deep into the foaming wash-tub and
glanced admiringly at her lodger as he sat in the doorway, supporting
on one knee an obese infant of eighteen months and on the other a
fine tabby cat.

James Brown was an elderly seafaring man, small and slight in build
and in manner suave, insinuating and perhaps a trifle sly. But he had
all the sailor’s love of children and animals, and the sailor’s knack
of making himself acceptable to them, for, as he sat with an empty
pipe wobbling in the grasp of his toothless gums, the baby beamed
with humid smiles, and the cat, rolled into a fluffy ball and purring
like a stocking-loom, worked its fingers ecstatically as if it were
trying on a new pair of gloves.

“It must be mortal lonely out at the lighthouse,” Mrs. Solly resumed.
“Only three men and never a neighbour to speak to; and, Lord! what a
muddle they must be in with no woman to look after them and keep ’em
tidy. But you won’t be overworked, Mr. Brown, in these long days; day
light till past nine o’clock. I don’t know what you’ll do to pass the
time.”

“Oh, I shall find plenty to do, I expect,” said Brown, “what with
cleanin’ the lamps and glasses and paintin’ up the ironwork. And that
reminds me,” he added, looking round at the clock, “that time’s
getting on. High water at half-past ten, and here it’s gone eight
o’clock.”

Mrs. Solly, acting on the hint, began rapidly to fish out the washed
garments and wring them out into the form of short ropes. Then,
having dried her hands on her apron, she relieved Brown of the
protesting baby.

“Your room will be ready for you, Mr. Brown,” said she, “when your
turn comes for a spell ashore; and main glad me and Tom will be to
see you back.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Solly, ma’am,” answered Brown, tenderly placing the
cat on the floor; “you won’t be more glad than what I will.” He shook
hands warmly with his land lady, kissed the baby, chucked the cat
under the chin, and, picking up his little chest by its becket, swung
it onto his shoulder and strode out of the cottage.

His way lay across the marshes, and, like the ships in the offing, he
shaped his course by the twin towers of Reculver that stood up
grotesquely on the rim of the land; and as he trod the springy turf,
Tom Solly’s fleecy charges looked up at him with vacant stares and
valedictory bleatings. Once, at a dyke-gate, he paused to look back
at the fair Kentish landscape: at the grey tower of St.
Nicholas-at-Wade peeping above the trees and the faraway mill at
Sarre, whirling slowly in the summer breeze; and, above all, at the
solitary cottage where, for a brief spell in his stormy life, he had
known the homely joys of domesticity and peace. Well, that was over
for the present, and the lighthouse loomed ahead. With a half-sigh he
passed through the gate and walked on towards Reculver.

Outside the whitewashed cottages with their official black chimneys a
petty-officer of the coast-guard was adjusting the halyards of the
flagstaff. He looked round as Brown approached, and hailed him
cheerily.

“Here you are, then,” said he, “all figged out in your new togs, too.
But we’re in a bit of a difficulty, d’ye see. We’ve got to pull up to
Whitstable this morning, so I can’t send a man out with you and I
can’t spare a boat.”

“Have I got to swim out, then?” asked Brown.

The coast-guard grinned. “Not in them new clothes, mate,” he
answered. “No, but there’s old Willett’s boat; he isn’t using her
to-day; he’s going over to Minster to see his daughter, and he’ll let
us have the loan of the boat. But there’s no one to go with you, and
I’m responsible to Willett.”

“Well, what about it?” asked Brown, with the deep-sea sailor’s
(usually misplaced) confidence in his power to handle a sailing-boat.
“D’ye think I can’t manage a tub of a boat? Me what’s used the sea
since I was a kid of ten?”

“Yes,” said the coast-guard; “but who’s to bring her back?”

“Why, the man that I’m going to relieve,” answered Brown. “He don’t
want to swim no more than what I do.”

The coast-guard reflected with his telescope pointed at a passing
barge. “Well, I suppose it’ll be all right,” he concluded; “but it’s
a pity they couldn’t send the tender round. However, if you undertake
to send the boat back, we’ll get her afloat. It’s time you were off.”

He strolled away to the back of the cottages, whence he presently
returned with two of his mates, and the four men proceeded along the
shore to where Willett’s boat lay just above high-water mark.

The _Emily_ was a beamy craft of the type locally known as a
“half-share skiff,” solidly built of oak, with varnished planking and
fitted with main and mizzen lugs. She was a good handful for four
men, and, as she slid over the soft chalk rocks with a hollow rumble,
the coast-guards debated the advisability of lifting out the bags of
shingle with which she was ballasted. However, she was at length
dragged down, ballast and all, to the water’s edge, and then, while
Brown stepped the mainmast, the petty-officer gave him his
directions. “What you’ve got to do,” said he, “is to make use of the
flood-tide. Keep her nose nor’-east, and with this trickle of
nor’-westerly breeze you ought to make the lighthouse in one board.
Anyhow don’t let her get east of the lighthouse, or, when the ebb
sets in, you’ll be in a fix.”

To these admonitions Brown listened with jaunty indifference as he
hoisted the sails and watched the incoming tide creep over the level
shore. Then the boat lifted on the gentle swell. Putting out an oar,
he gave a vigorous shove off that sent the boat, with a final scrape,
clear of the beach, and then, having dropped the rudder onto its
pintles, he seated himself and calmly belayed the main-sheet.

“There he goes,” growled the coast-guard; “makin’ fast his sheet.
They _will_ do it” (he invariably did it himself), “and that’s how
accidents happen. I hope old Willett ’ll see his boat back all right.”

He stood for some time watching the dwindling boat as it sidled
across the smooth water; then he turned and followed his mates
towards the station.

Out on the south-western edge of the Girdler Sand, just inside the
two-fathom line, the spindle-shanked lighthouse stood a-straddle on
its long screw-piles like some uncouth red-bodied wading bird. It was
now nearly half flood tide. The highest shoals were long since
covered, and the lighthouse rose above the smooth sea as solitary as
a slaver becalmed in the “middle passage.”

On the gallery outside the lantern were two men, the entire staff of
the building, of whom one sat huddled in a chair with his left leg
propped up with pillows on another, while his companion rested a
telescope on the rail and peered at the faint grey line of the
distant land and the two tiny points that marked the twin spires of
Reculver.

“I don’t see any signs of the boat, Harry,” said he.

The other man groaned. “I shall lose the tide,” he complained, “and
then there’s another day gone.”

“They can pull you down to Birchington and put you in the train,”
said the first man.

“I don’t want no trains,” growled the invalid. “The boat ’ll be bad
enough. I suppose there’s nothing coming our way, Tom?”

Tom turned his face eastward and shaded his eyes. “There’s a brig
coming across the tide from the north,” he said. “Looks like a
collier.” He pointed his telescope at the approaching vessel, and
added: “She’s got two new cloths in her upper fore top-sail, one on
each leech.”

The other man sat up eagerly. “What’s her trysail like, Tom?” he
asked.

“Can’t see it,” replied Tom. “Yes, I can, now: it’s tanned. Why,
that’ll be the old _Utopia_, Harry; she’s the only brig I know that’s
got a tanned trysail.”

“Look here, Tom,” exclaimed the other, “If that’s the _Utopia_, she’s
going to my home and I’m going aboard of her. Captain Mockett ’ll
give me a passage, I know.”

“You oughtn’t to go until you’re relieved, you know, Barnett,” said
Tom doubtfully; “it’s against regulations to leave your station.”

“Regulations be blowed!” exclaimed Barnett. “My leg’s more to me than
the regulations. I don’t want to be a cripple all my life. Besides,
I’m no good here, and this new chap, Brown, will be coming out
presently. You run up the signal, Tom, like a good comrade, and hail
the brig.”

“Well, it’s your look-out,” said Tom, “and I don’t mind saying that
if I was in your place I should cut off home and see a doctor, if I
got the chance.” He sauntered off to the flag-locker, and, selecting
the two code-flags, deliberately toggled them onto the halyards.
Then, as the brig swept up within range, he hoisted the little balls
of bunting to the flagstaff-head and jerked the halyards, when the
two flags blew out making the signal “Need assistance.”

Promptly a coal-soiled answering pennant soared to the brig’s
main-truck; less promptly the collier went about, and, turning her
nose down stream, slowly drifted stern-forwards towards the
lighthouse. Then a boat slid out through her gangway, and a couple of
men plied the oars vigorously.

“Lighthouse ahoy!” roared one of them, as the boat came within hail.
“What’s amiss?”

“Harry Barnett has broke his leg,” shouted the lighthouse keeper,
“and he wants to know if Captain Mockett will give him a passage to
Whitstable.”

The boat turned back to the brig, and after a brief and bellowed
consultation, once more pulled towards the lighthouse.

“Skipper says yus,” roared the sailor, when he was within ear-shot,
“and he says look alive, ’cause he don’t want to miss his tide.”

The injured man heaved a sigh of relief. “That’s good news,” said he,
“though, how the blazes I’m going to get down the ladder is more than
I can tell. What do you say, Jeffreys?”

“I say you’d better let me lower you with the tackle,” replied
Jeffreys. “You can sit in the bight of a rope and I’ll give you a
line to steady yourself with.”

“Ah, that’ll do, Tom,” said Barnett; “but, for the Lord’s sake, pay
out the fall-rope gently.”

The arrangements were made so quickly that by the time the boat was
fast alongside everything was in readiness, and a minute later the
injured man, dangling like a gigantic spider from the end of the
tackle, slowly descended, cursing volubly to the accompaniment of the
creaking of the blocks. His chest and kit-bag followed, and, as soon
as these were unhooked from the tackle, the boat pulled off to the
brig, which was now slowly creeping stern-foremost past the
lighthouse. The sick man was hoisted up the side, his chest handed up
after him, and then the brig was put on her course due South across
the Kentish Flats.

Jeffreys stood on the gallery watching the receding vessel and
listening to the voices of her crew as they grew small and weak in
the increasing distance. Now that his gruff companion was gone, a
strange loneliness had fallen on the lighthouse. The last of the
homeward-bound ships had long since passed up the Princes Channel and
left the calm sea desolate and blank. The distant buoys, showing as
tiny black dots on the glassy surface, and the spindly shapes of the
beacons which stood up from invisible shoals, but emphasized the
solitude of the empty sea, and the tolling of the bell buoy on the
Shivering Sand, stealing faintly down the wind, sounded weird and
mournful. The day’s work was already done. The lenses were polished,
the lamps had been trimmed, and the little motor that worked the fog
horn had been cleaned and oiled. There were several odd jobs, it is
true, waiting to be done, as there always are in a lighthouse; but,
just now, Jeffreys was not in a working humour. A new comrade was
coming into his life to-day, a stranger with whom he was to be shut
up alone, night and day, for a month on end, and whose temper and
tastes and habits might mean for him pleasant companionship or
jangling and discord without end. Who was this man Brown? What had he
been? and what was he like? These were the questions that passed,
naturally enough, through the lighthouse keeper’s mind and distracted
him from his usual thoughts and occupations.

Presently a speck on the landward horizon caught his eye. He snatched
up the telescope eagerly to inspect it. Yes, it was a boat; but not
the coast-guard’s cutter, for which he was looking. Evidently a
fisherman’s boat and with only one man in it. He laid down the
telescope with a sigh of disappointment, and, filling his pipe,
leaned on the rail with a dreamy eye bent on the faint grey line of
the land.

Three long years had he spent in this dreary solitude, so repugnant
to his active, restless nature: three blank, interminable years, with
nothing to look back on but the endless succession of summer calms,
stormy nights and the chilly fogs of winter, when the unseen steamers
hooted from the void and the fog-horn bellowed its hoarse warning.

Why had he come to this God-forsaken spot? and why did he stay, when
the wide world called to him? And then memory painted him a picture
on which his mind’s eye had often looked before and which once again
arose before him, shutting out the vision of the calm sea and the
distant land. It was a brightly-coloured picture. It showed a
cloudless sky brooding over the deep blue tropic sea: and in the
middle of the picture, see-sawing gently on the quiet swell, a
white-painted barque.

Her sails were clewed up untidily, her swinging yards jerked at the
slack braces and her untended wheel revolved to and fro to the
oscillations of the rudder.

She was not a derelict, for more than a dozen men were on her deck;
but the men were all drunk and mostly asleep, and there was never an
officer among them.

Then he saw the interior of one of her cabins. The chart rack, the
tell-tale compass and the chronometers marked it as the captain’s
cabin. In it were four men, and two of them lay dead on the deck. Of
the other two, one was a small, cunning-faced man, who was, at the
moment, kneeling be side one of the corpses to wipe a knife upon its
coat. The fourth man was himself.

Again, he saw the two murderers stealing off in a quarter boat, as
the barque with her drunken crew drifted towards the spouting surf of
a river-bar. He saw the ship melt away in the surf like an icicle in
the sunshine; and, later, two shipwrecked mariners, picked up in an
open boat and set ashore at an American port.

That was why he was here. Because he was a murderer. The other
scoundrel, Amos Todd, had turned Queen’s Evidence and denounced him,
and he had barely managed to escape. Since then he had hidden himself
from the great world, and here he must continue to hide, not from the
law--for his person was unknown now that his shipmates were dead--but
from the partner of his crime. It was the fear of Todd that had
changed him from Jeffrey Rorke to Tom Jeffreys and had sent him to
the Girdler, a prisoner for life. Todd might die--might even now be
dead--but he would never hear of it: would never hear the news of his
release.

He roused himself and once more pointed his telescope at the distant
boat. She was considerably nearer now and seemed to be heading out
towards the lighthouse. Perhaps the man in her was bringing a
message; at any rate, there was no sign of the coast-guard’s cutter.

He went in, and, betaking himself to the kitchen, busied himself with
a few simple preparations for dinner. But there was nothing to cook,
for there remained the cold meat from yesterday’s cooking, which he
would make sufficient, with some biscuit in place of potatoes. He
felt restless and unstrung; the solitude irked him, and the
everlasting wash of the water among the piles jarred on his nerves.

When he went out again into the gallery the ebb-tide had set in
strongly and the boat was little more than a mile distant; and now,
through the glass, he could see that the man in her wore the uniform
cap of the Trinity House. Then the man must be his future comrade,
Brown; but this was very extraordinary. What were they to do with the
boat? There was no one to take her back.

The breeze was dying away. As he watched the boat, he saw the man
lower the sail and take to his oars; and something of hurry in the
way the man pulled over the gathering tide, caused Jeffreys to look
round the horizon. And then, for the first time, he noticed a bank of
fog creeping up from the east and already so near that the beacon on
the East Girdler had faded out of sight. He hastened in to start the
little motor that compressed the air for the fog-horn and waited
awhile to see that the mechanism was running properly. Then, as the
deck vibrated to the roar of the horn, he went out once more into the
gallery.

The fog was now all round the lighthouse and the boat was hidden from
view. He listened intently. The enclosing wall of vapour seemed to
have shut out sound as well as vision. At intervals the horn bellowed
its note of warning, and then all was still save the murmur of the
water among the piles below, and, infinitely faint and far away, the
mournful tolling of the bell on the Shivering Sand.

At length there came to his ear the muffled sound of oars working in
the tholes; then, at the very edge of the circle of grey water that
was visible, the boat appeared through the fog, pale and spectral,
with a shadowy figure pulling furiously. The horn emitted a hoarse
growl; the man looked round, perceived the lighthouse and altered his
course towards it.

Jeffreys descended the iron stairway, and, walking along the lower
gallery, stood at the head of the ladder earnestly watching the
approaching stranger. Already he was tired of being alone. The
yearning for human companionship had been growing ever since Barnett
left. But what sort of comrade was this stranger who was coming into
his life? And coming to occupy so dominant a place in it.

The boat swept down swiftly athwart the hurrying tide. Nearer it came
and yet nearer: and still Jeffreys could catch no glimpse of his new
comrade’s face. At length it came fairly alongside and bumped against
the fender-posts; the stranger whisked in an oar and grabbed a rung
of the ladder, and Jeffreys dropped a coil of rope into the boat. And
still the man’s face was hidden.

Jeffreys, leaned out over the ladder and watched him anxiously, as he
made fast the rope, unhooked the sail from the traveller and
unstepped the mast. When he had set all in order, the stranger picked
up a small chest, and, swinging it over his shoulder, stepped onto
the ladder. Slowly, by reason of his encumbrance, he mounted, rung by
rung, with never an upward glance, and Jeffreys gazed down at the top
of his head with growing curiosity. At last he reached the top of the
ladder and Jeffreys stooped to lend him a hand. Then, for the first
time, he looked up, and Jeffreys started back with a blanched face.

“God Almighty!” he gasped. “It’s Amos Todd!”

As the newcomer stepped on the gallery, the fog-horn emitted a roar
like that of some hungry monster. Jeffreys turned abruptly without a
word, and walked to the stairs, followed by Todd, and the two men
ascended with never a sound but the hollow clank of their footsteps
on the iron plates. Silently Jeffreys stalked into the living-room
and, as his companion followed, he turned and motioned to the latter
to set down his chest.

“You ain’t much of a talker, mate,” said Todd, looking round the room
in some surprise; “ain’t you going to say ‘good-morning’? We’re going
to be good comrades, I hope. I’m Jim Brown, the new hand, I am; what
might your name be?”

Jeffreys turned on him suddenly and led him to the window. “Look at
me carefully, Amos Todd,” he said sternly, “and then ask yourself
what my name is.”

At the sound of his voice Todd looked up with a start and turned pale
as death. “It can’t be,” he whispered, “it can’t be Jeff Rorke!”

The other man laughed harshly, and leaning forward, said in a low
voice: “Hast thou found me, O mine enemy!”

“Don’t say that!” exclaimed Todd. “Don’t call me your enemy, Jeff.
Lord knows but I’m glad to see you, though I’d never have known you
without your beard and with that grey hair. I’ve been to blame, Jeff,
and I know it; but it ain’t no use raking up old grudges. Let bygones
be bygones, Jeff, and let us be pals as we used to be.” He wiped his
face with his handkerchief and watched his companion apprehensively.

“Sit down,” said Rorke, pointing to a shabby rep-covered arm-chair;
“sit down and tell me what you’ve done with all that money. You’ve
blued it all, I suppose, or you wouldn’t be here.”

“Robbed, Jeff,” answered Todd; “robbed of every penny. Ah! that was
an unfortunate affair, that job on board the old _Sea-flower_. But
it’s over and done with and we’d best forget it. They’re all dead but
us, Jeff, so we’re safe enough so long as we keep our mouths shut;
all at the bottom of the sea--and the best place for ’em too.”

“Yes,” Rorke replied fiercely, “that’s the best place for your
shipmates when they know too much; at the bottom of the sea or
swinging at the end of a rope.” He paced up and down the little room
with rapid strides, and each time that he approached Todd’s chair the
latter shrank back with an expression of alarm.

“Don’t sit there staring at me,” said Rorke. “Why don’t you smoke or
do something?”

Todd hastily produced a pipe from his pocket, and having filled it
from a moleskin pouch, stuck it in his mouth while he searched for a
match. Apparently he carried his matches loose in his pocket, for he
presently brought one forth--a red-headed match, which, when he
struck it on the wall, lighted with a pale-blue flame. He applied it
to his pipe, sucking in his cheeks while he kept his eyes fixed on
his companion. Rorke, meanwhile, halted in his walk to cut some
shavings from a cake of hard tobacco with a large clasp-knife; and,
as he stood, he gazed with frowning abstraction at Todd.

“This pipe’s stopped,” said the latter, sucking ineffectually at the
mouthpiece. “Have you got such a thing as a piece of wire, Jeff?”

“No, I haven’t,” replied Rorke; “not up here. I’ll get a bit from the
store presently. Here, take this pipe till you can clean your own:
I’ve got another in the rack there.” The sailor’s natural hospitality
overcoming for the moment his animosity, he thrust the pipe that he
had just filled towards Todd, who took it with a mumbled “Thank you”
and an anxious eye on the open knife. On the wall beside the chair
was a roughly-carved pipe-rack containing several pipes, one of which
Rorke lifted out; and, as he leaned over the chair to reach it,
Todd’s face went several shades paler.

“Well, Jeff,” he said, after a pause, while Rorke cut a fresh “fill”
of tobacco, “are we going to be pals same as what we used to be?”

Rorke’s animosity lighted up afresh. “Am I going to be pals with the
man that tried to swear away my life?” he said sternly; and after a
pause he added: “That wants thinking about, that does; and meantime I
must go and look at the engine.”

When Rorke had gone the new hand sat, with the two pipes in his
hands, reflecting deeply. Abstractedly he stuck the fresh pipe into
his mouth, and, dropping the stopped one into the rack, felt for a
match. Still with an air of abstraction he lit the pipe, and having
smoked for a minute or two, rose from the chair and began softly to
creep across the room, looking about him and listening intently. At
the door he paused to look out into the fog, and then, having again
listened attentively, he stepped on tip-toe out onto the gallery and
along towards the stairway. Of a sudden the voice of Rorke brought
him up with a start.

“Hallo, Todd! where are you off to?”

“I’m just going down to make the boat secure,” was the reply.

“Never you mind about the boat,” said Rorke. “I’ll see to her.”

“Right-o, Jeff,” said Todd, still edging towards the stairway. “But,
I say, mate, where’s the other man--the man that I’m to relieve?”

“There ain’t any other man,” replied Rorke; “he went off aboard a
collier.”

Todd’s face suddenly became grey and haggard. “Then there’s no one
here but us two!” he gasped; and then, with an effort to conceal his
fear, he asked: “But who’s going to take the boat back?”

“We’ll see about that presently,” replied Rorke; “you get along in
and unpack your chest.”

He came out on the gallery as he spoke, with a lowering frown on his
face. Todd cast a terrified glance at him, and then turned and ran
for his life towards the stairway.

“Come back!” roared Rorke, springing forward along the gallery; but
Todd’s feet were already clattering down the iron steps. By the time
Rorke reached the head of the stairs, the fugitive was near the
bottom; but here, in his haste, he stumbled, barely saving himself by
the handrail, and when he recovered his balance Rorke was upon him.
Todd darted to the head of the ladder, but, as he grasped the
stanchion, his pursuer seized him by the collar. In a moment he had
turned with his hand under his coat. There was a quick blow, a loud
curse from Rorke, an answering yell from Todd, and a knife fell
spinning through the air and dropped into the fore-peak of the boat
below.

“You murderous little devil!” said Rorke in an ominously quiet voice,
with his bleeding hand gripping his captive by the throat. “Handy
with your knife as ever, eh? So you were off to give information,
were you?”

“No, I wasn’t Jeff,” replied Todd in a choking voice; “I wasn’t,
s’elp me, God. Let go, Jeff. I didn’t mean no harm. I was only----”
With a sudden wrench he freed one hand and struck out frantically at
his captor’s face. But Rorke warded off the blow, and, grasping the
other wrist, gave a violent push and let go. Todd staggered backward
a few paces along the staging, bringing up at the extreme edge; and
here, for a sensible time, he stood with wide-open mouth and starting
eye-balls, swaying and clutching wildly at the air. Then, with a
shrill scream, he toppled backwards and fell, striking a pile in his
descent and rebounding into the water.

In spite of the audible thump of his head on the pile, he was not
stunned, for when he rose to the surface, he struck out vigorously,
uttering short, stifled cries for help. Rorke watched him with set
teeth and quickened breath, but made no move. Smaller and still
smaller grew the head with its little circle of ripples, swept away
on the swift ebb-tide, and fainter the bubbling cries that came
across the smooth water. At length as the small black spot began to
fade in the fog, the drowning man, with a final effort, raised his
head clear of the surface and sent a last, despairing shriek towards
the lighthouse. The fog-horn sent back an answering bellow; the head
sank below the surface and was seen no more; and in the dreadful
stillness that settled down upon the sea there sounded faint and far
away the muffled tolling of a bell.

Rorke stood for some minutes immovable, wrapped in thought. Presently
the distant hoot of a steamer’s whistle aroused him. The ebb-tide
shipping was beginning to come down and the fog might lift at any
moment; and there was the boat still alongside. She must be disposed
of at once. No one had seen her arrive and no one must see her made
fast to the lighthouse. Once get rid of the boat and all traces of
Todd’s visit would be destroyed. He ran down the ladder and stepped
into the boat. It was simple. She was heavily ballasted, and would go
down if she filled.

He shifted some of the bags of shingle, and, lifting the bottom
boards, pulled out the plug. Instantly a large jet of water spouted
up into the bottom. Rorke looked at it critically, and, deciding that
it would fill her in a few minutes, replaced the bottom boards; and
having secured the mast and sail with a few turns of the sheet round
a thwart, to prevent them from floating away, he cast off the
mooring-rope and stepped on the ladder.

As the released boat began to move away on the tide, he ran up and
mounted to the upper gallery to watch her disappearance. Suddenly he
remembered Todd’s chest. It was still in the room below. With a
hurried glance around into the fog, he ran down to the room, and
snatching up the chest, carried it out on the lower gallery. After
another nervous glance around to assure himself that no craft was in
sight, he heaved the chest over the handrail, and, when it fell with
a loud splash into the sea, he waited to watch it float away after
its owner and the sunken boat. But it never rose; and presently he
returned to the upper gallery.

The fog was thinning perceptibly now, and the boat remained plainly
visible as she drifted away. But she sank more slowly than he had
expected, and presently as she drifted farther away, he fetched the
telescope and peered at her with growing anxiety. It would be
unfortunate if any one saw her; if she should be picked up here, with
her plug out, it would be disastrous.

He was beginning to be really alarmed. Through the glass he could see
that the boat was now rolling in a sluggish, water-logged fashion,
but she still showed some inches of free-board, and the fog was
thinning every moment.

Presently the blast of a steamer’s whistle sounded close at hand. He
looked round hurriedly and, seeing nothing, again pointed the
telescope eagerly at the dwindling boat. Suddenly he gave a gasp of
relief. The boat had rolled gun wale under; had staggered back for a
moment and then rolled again, slowly, finally, with the water pouring
in over the submerged gunwale.

In a few more seconds she had vanished. Rorke lowered the telescope
and took a deep breath. Now he was safe. The boat had sunk unseen.
But he was better than safe: he was free. His evil spirit, the
standing menace of his life, was gone, and the wide world, the world
of life, of action, of pleasure, called to him.

In a few minutes the fog lifted. The sun shone brightly on the
red-funnelled cattle-boat whose whistle had startled him just now,
the summer blue came back to sky and sea, and the land peeped once
more over the edge of the horizon.

He went in, whistling cheerfully, and stopped the motor; returned to
coil away the rope that he had thrown to Todd; and, when he had
hoisted a signal for assistance, he went in once more to eat his
solitary meal in peace and gladness.


PART II

“THE SINGING BONE”

(_Related by Christopher Jervis, M.D._)

To every kind of scientific work a certain amount of manual labour
naturally appertains, labour that cannot be performed by the
scientist himself, since art is long but life is short. A chemical
analysis involves a laborious “clean up” of apparatus and laboratory,
for which the chemist has no time; the preparation of a skeleton--the
maceration, bleaching, “assembling,” and riveting together of
bones--must be carried out by some one whose time is not too
precious. And so with other Scientific activities. Behind the man of
science with his outfit of knowledge is the indispensable mechanic
with his outfit of manual skill.

Thorndyke’s laboratory assistant, Polton, was a fine example of the
latter type, deft, resourceful, ingenious and untiring. He was
somewhat of an inventive genius, too; and it was one of his
inventions that connected us with the singular case that I am about
to record.

Though by trade a watchmaker, Polton was, by choice, an optician.
Optical apparatus was the passion of his life; and when, one day, he
produced for our inspection an improved prism for increasing the
efficiency of gas-buoys, Thorndyke at once brought the invention to
the notice of a friend at the Trinity House.

As a consequence, we three--Thorndyke, Polton and I--found ourselves
early on a fine July morning making our way down Middle Temple Lane
bound for the Temple Pier. A small oil-launch lay alongside the
pontoon, and, as we made our appearance, a red-faced, white-whiskered
gentleman stood up in the cockpit.

“Here’s a delightful morning, doctor,” he sang out in a fine, brassy,
resonant, seafaring voice; “sort of day for a trip to the lower
river, hey? Hallo, Polton! Coming down to take the bread out of our
mouths, are you? Ha, ha!” The cheery laugh rang out over the river
and mingled with the throb of the engine as the launch moved off from
the pier.

Captain Grumpass was one of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House.
Formerly a client of Thorndyke’s he had subsided, as Thorndyke’s
clients were apt to do, into the position of a personal friend, and
his hearty regard included our invaluable assistant.

“Nice state of things,” continued the captain, with a chuckle, “when
a body of nautical experts have got to be taught their business by a
parcel of lawyers or doctors, what? I suppose trade’s slack and
‘Satan findeth mischief still,’ hey, Polton?”

“There isn’t much doing on the civil side, sir,” replied Polton, with
a quaint, crinkly smile, “but the criminals are still going strong.”

“Ha! mystery department still flourishing, what? And, by Jove!
talking of mysteries, doctor, our people have got a queer problem to
work out; something quite in your line--quite. Yes, and, by the Lord
Moses, since I’ve got you here, why shouldn’t I suck your brains?”

“Exactly,” said Thorndyke. “Why shouldn’t you?”

“Well, then, I will,” said the captain, “so here goes. All hands to
the pump!” He lit a cigar, and, after a few preliminary puffs, began:
“The mystery, shortly stated, is this: one of our lighthousemen has
disappeared--vanished off the face of the earth and left no trace. He
may have bolted, he may have been drowned accidentally or he may have
been murdered. But I’d rather give you the particulars in order. At
the end of last week a barge brought into Ramsgate a letter from the
screw-pile lighthouse on the Girdler. There are only two men there,
and it seems that one of them, a man named Barnett, had broken his
leg, and he asked that the tender should be sent to bring him ashore.
Well, it happened that the local tender, the _Warden_, was up on the
slip in Ramsgate Harbour, having a scrape down, and wouldn’t be
available for a day or two, so, as the case was urgent, the officer
at Ramsgate sent a letter to the lighthouse by one of the pleasure
steamers saying that the man should be relieved by boat on the
following morning, which was Saturday. He also wrote to a new hand
who had just been taken on, a man named James Brown, who was lodging
near Reculver, waiting his turn, telling him to go out on Saturday
morning in the coast-guard’s boat; and he sent a third letter to the
coast-guard at Reculver asking him to take Brown out to the
lighthouse and bring Barnett ashore. Well, between them, they made a
fine muddle of it. The coast-guard couldn’t spare either a boat or a
man, so they borrowed a fisherman’s boat, and in this the man Brown
started off alone, like an idiot, on the chance that Barnett would be
able to sail the boat back in spite of his broken leg.

“Meanwhile Barnett, who is a Whitstable man, had signalled a collier
bound for his native town, and got taken off; so that the other
keeper, Thomas Jeffreys, was left alone until Brown should turn up.

“But Brown never did turn up. The coast-guard helped him to put off
and saw him well out to sea, and the keeper, Jeffreys, saw a
sailing-boat with one man in her making for the lighthouse. Then a
bank of fog came up and hit the boat, and when the fog cleared she
was nowhere to be seen. Man and boat had vanished and left no sign.”

“He may have been run down,” Thorndyke suggested.

“He may,” agreed the captain, “but no accident has been reported. The
coast-guards think he may have capsized in a squall--they saw him
make the sheet fast. But there weren’t any squalls; the weather was
quite calm.”

“Was he all right and well when he put off?” inquired Thorndyke.

“Yes,” replied the captain, “the coast-guards’ report is highly
circumstantial; in fact, it’s full of silly details that have no
bearing on anything. This is what they say.” He pulled out an
official letter and read: “‘When last seen, the missing man was
seated in the boat’s stern to windward of the helm. He had belayed
the sheet. He was holding a pipe and tobacco-pouch in his hands and
steering with his elbow. He was filling the pipe from the
tobacco-pouch.’ There! ‘He was holding the pipe in his hand,’ mark
you! not with his toes; and he was filling it from a tobacco-pouch,
whereas you’d have expected him to fill it from a coal scuttle or a
feeding-bottle. Bah!” The captain rammed the letter back in his
pocket and puffed scornfully at his cigar.

“You are hardly fair to the coastguard,” said Thorndyke, laughing at
the captain’s vehemence. “The duty of a witness is to give _all_ the
facts, not a judicious selection.”

“But, my dear sir,” said Captain Grumpass, “what the deuce can it
matter what the poor devil filled his pipe from?”

“Who can say?” answered Thorndyke. “It may turn out to be a highly
material fact. One never knows before hand. The value of a particular
fact depends on its relation to the rest of the evidence.”

“I suppose it does,” grunted the captain; and he continued to smoke
in reflective silence until we opened Blackwall Point, when he
suddenly stood up.

“There’s a steam trawler alongside our wharf,” he announced. “Now
what the deuce can she be doing there?” He scanned the little steamer
attentively, and continued: “They seem to be landing something, too.
Just pass me those glasses, Polton. Why, hang me! it’s a dead body!
But why on earth are they landing it on our wharf? They must have
known you were coming, doctor.”

As the launch swept alongside the wharf, the captain sprang up
lightly and approached the group gathered round the body. “What’s
this?” he asked. “Why have they brought this thing here?”

The master of the trawler, who had superintended the landing,
proceeded to explain.

“It’s one of your men, sir,” said he. “We saw the body lying on the
edge of the South Shingles Sand, close to the beacon, as we passed at
low water, so we put off the boat and fetched it aboard. As there was
nothing to identify the man by, I had a look in his pockets and found
this letter.” He handed the captain an official envelope addressed to
“Mr. J. Brown, c/o Mr. Solly, Shepherd, Reculver, Kent.”

“Why, this is the man we were speaking about, doctor,” exclaimed
Captain Grumpass. “What a very singular coincidence. But what are we
to do with the body?”

“You will have to write to the coroner,” replied Thorndyke. “By the
way, did you turn out all the pockets?” he asked, turning to the
skipper of the trawler.

“No, sir,” was the reply. “I found the letter in the first pocket
that I felt in, so I didn’t examine any of the others. Is there
anything more that you want to know, sir?”

“Nothing but your name and address, for the coroner,” replied
Thorndyke, and the skipper, having given this information and
expressed the hope that the coroner would not keep him “hanging
about,” returned to his vessel and pursued his way to Billingsgate.

“I wonder if you would mind having a look at the body of this poor
devil, while Polton is showing us his contraptions,” said Captain
Grumpass.

“I can’t do much without a coroner’s order,” replied Thorndyke; “but
if it will give you any satisfaction, Jervis and I will make a
preliminary inspection with pleasure.”

“I should be glad if you would,” said the captain. “We should like to
know that the poor beggar met his end fairly.”

The body was accordingly moved to a shed, and, as Polton was led
away, carrying the black bag that contained his precious model, we
entered the shed and commenced our investigation.

The deceased was a small, elderly man, decently dressed in a somewhat
nautical fashion. He appeared to have been dead only two or three
days, and the body, unlike the majority of sea-borne corpses, was
uninjured by fish or crabs. There were no fractured bones or other
gross injuries, and no wounds, excepting a rugged tear in the scalp
at the back of the head.

“The general appearance of the body,” said Thorndyke, when he had
noted these particulars, “suggests death by drowning, though, of
course, we can’t give a definite opinion until a _post mortem_ has
been made.”

“You don’t attach any significance to that scalp-wound, then?” I
asked.

“As a cause of death? No. It was obviously inflicted during life, but
it seems to have been an oblique blow that spent its force on the
scalp, leaving the skull uninjured. But it is very significant in
another way.”

“In what way?” I asked.

Thorndyke took out his pocket-case and extracted a pair of forceps.
“Consider the circumstances,” said he. “This man put off from the
shore to go to the lighthouse, but never arrived there. The question
is, where did he arrive?” As he spoke he stooped over the corpse and
turned back the hair round the wound with the beak of the forceps.
“Look at those white objects among the hair, Jervis, and inside the
wound. They tell us something, I think.”

I examined, through my lens, the chalky fragments to which he
pointed. “These seem to be bits of shells and the tubes of some
marine worm,” I said.

“Yes,” he answered; “the broken shells are evidently those of the
acorn barnacle, and the other fragments are mostly pieces of the
tubes of the common serpula. The inference that these objects suggest
is an important one. It is that this wound was produced by some body
encrusted by acorn barnacles and serpulæ; that is to say, by a body
that is periodically submerged. Now, what can that body be, and how
can the deceased have knocked his head against it?”

“It might be the stem of a ship that ran him down,” I suggested.

“I don’t think you would find many serpulæ on the stem of a ship,”
said Thorndyke. “The combination rather suggests some stationary
object between tidemarks, such as a beacon. But one doesn’t see how a
man could knock his head against a beacon, while, on the other hand,
there are no other stationary objects out in the estuary to knock
against except buoys, and a buoy presents a flat surface that could
hardly have produced this wound. By the way, we may as well see what
there is in his pockets, though it is not likely that robbery had
anything to do with his death.”

“No,” I agreed, “and I see his watch is in his pocket; quite a good
silver one,” I added, taking it out. “It has stopped at 12.13.”

“That may be important,” said Thorndyke, making a note of the fact;
“but we had better examine the pockets one at a time, and put the
things back when we have looked at them.”

The first pocket that we turned out was the left hip-pocket of the
monkey jacket. This was apparently the one that the skipper had
rifled, for we found in it two letters, both bearing the crest of the
Trinity House. These, of course, we returned without reading, and
then passed on to the right pocket. The contents of this were
commonplace enough, consisting of a briar pipe, a moleskin pouch and
a number of loose matches.

“Rather a casual proceeding, this,” I remarked, “to carry matches
loose in the pocket, and a pipe with them, too.”

“Yes,” agreed Thorndyke; “especially with these very inflammable
matches. You notice that the sticks had been coated at the upper end
with sulphur before the red phosphorous heads were put on. They would
light with a touch, and would be very difficult to extinguish; which,
no doubt, is the reason that this type of match is so popular among
seamen, who have to light their pipes in all sorts of weather.” As he
spoke he picked up the pipe and looked at it reflectively, turning it
over in his hand and peering into the bowl. Suddenly he glanced from
the pipe to the dead man’s face and then, with the forceps, turned
back the lips to look into the mouth.

“Let us see what tobacco he smokes,” said he.

I opened the sodden pouch and displayed a mass of dark, fine-cut
tobacco. “It looks like shag,” I said.

“Yes, it is shag,” he replied; “and now we will see what is in the
pipe. It has been only half-smoked out.” He dug out the “dottle” with
his pocket-knife onto a sheet of paper, and we both inspected it.
Clearly it was not shag, for it consisted of coarsely-cut shreds and
was nearly black.

“Shavings from a cake of ‘hard,’” was my verdict, and Thorndyke
agreed as he shot the fragments back into the pipe.

The other pockets yielded nothing of interest, except a pocket-knife,
which Thorndyke opened and examined closely. There was not much
money, though as much as one would expect, and enough to exclude the
idea of robbery.

“Is there a sheath-knife on that strap?” Thorndyke asked, pointing to
a narrow leather belt. I turned back the jacket and looked.

“There is a sheath,” I said, “but no knife. It must have dropped out.”

“That is rather odd,” said Thorndyke. “A sailor’s sheath-knife takes
a deal of shaking out as a rule. It is intended to be used in working
on the rigging when the man is aloft, so that he can get it out with
one hand while he is holding on with the other. It has to be and
usually is very secure, for the sheath holds half the handle as well
as the blade. What makes one notice the matter in this case is that
the man, as you see, carried a pocket-knife; and, as this would serve
all the ordinary purposes of a knife, it seems to suggest that the
sheath-knife was carried for defensive purposes: as a weapon, in
fact. However, we can’t get much further in the case with out a _post
mortem_, and here comes the captain.”

Captain Grumpass entered the shed and looked down commiseratingly at
the dead seaman.

“Is there anything, doctor, that throws any light on the man’s
disappearance?” he asked.

“There are one or two curious features in the case,” Thorndyke
replied; “but, oddly enough, the only really important point arises
out of that statement of the coastguard’s, concerning which you were
so scornful.”

“You don’t say so!” exclaimed the captain.

“Yes,” said Thorndyke; “the coast-guard states that when last seen
deceased was filling his pipe from his tobacco pouch. Now his pouch
contains shag; but the pipe in his pocket contains hard cut.”

“Is there no cake tobacco in any of the pockets?”

“Not a fragment. Of course, it is possible that he might have had a
piece and used it up to fill the pipe; but there is no trace of any
on the blade of his pocket-knife, and you know how this juicy black
cake stains a knife-blade. His sheath-knife is missing, but he would
hardly have used that to shred tobacco when he had a pocket-knife.”

“No,” assented the captain; “but are you sure he hadn’t a second
pipe?”

“There was only one pipe,” replied Thorndyke, “and that was not his
own.”

“Not his own!” exclaimed the captain, halting by a huge, chequered
buoy to stare at my colleague. “How do you know it was not his own?”

“By the appearance of the vulcanite mouthpiece,” said Thorndyke. “It
showed deep tooth-marks; in fact, it was nearly bitten through. Now a
man who bites through his pipe usually presents certain definite
physical peculiarities, among which is, necessarily, a fairly good
set of teeth. But the dead man had not a tooth in his head.”

The captain cogitated a while, and then remarked: “I don’t quite see
the bearing of this.”

“Don’t you?” said Thorndyke. “It seems to me highly suggestive. Here
is a man who, when last seen, was filling his pipe with a particular
kind of tobacco. He is picked up dead, and his pipe contains a
totally different kind of tobacco. Where did that tobacco come from?
The obvious suggestion is that he had met some one.”

“Yes, it does look like it,” agreed the captain.

“Then,” continued Thorndyke, “there is the fact that his sheath-knife
is missing. That may mean nothing, but we have to bear it in mind.
And there is another curious circumstance: there is a wound on the
back of the head caused by a heavy bump against some body that was
covered with acorn barnacles and marine worms. Now there are no piers
or stages out in the open estuary. The question is, what could he
have struck?”

“Oh, there is nothing in that,” said the captain. “When a body has
been washing about in a tide-way for close on three days----”

“But this is not a question of a body,” Thorndyke interrupted. “The
wound was made during life.”

“The deuce it was!” exclaimed the captain. “Well, all I can suggest
is that he must have fouled one of the beacons in the fog, stove in
his boat and bumped his head, though, I must admit, that’s rather a
lame explanation.” He stood for a minute gazing at his toes with a
cogitative frown and then looked up at Thorndyke.

“I have an idea,” he said. “From what you say, this matter wants
looking into pretty carefully. Now, I am going down on the tender
to-day to make inquiries on the spot. What do you say to coming with
me as adviser--as a matter of business, of course--you and Dr.
Jervis? I shall start about eleven; we shall be at the lighthouse by
three o’clock, and you can get back to town to-night, if you want to.
What do you say?”

“There’s nothing to hinder us,” I put in eagerly, for even at
Bugsby’s Hole the river looked very alluring on this summer morning.

“Very well,” said Thorndyke, “we will come. Jervis is evidently
hankering for a sea-trip, and so am I, for that matter.”

“It’s a business engagement, you know,” the captain stipulated.

“Nothing of the kind,” said Thorndyke; “it’s unmitigated pleasure;
the pleasure of the voyage and your high well-born society.”

“I didn’t mean that,” grumbled the captain, “but, if you are coming
as guests, send your man for your nightgear and let us bring you back
tomorrow evening.”

“We won’t disturb Polton,” said my colleague; “we can take the train
from Blackwall and fetch our things ourselves. Eleven o’clock, you
said?”

“Thereabouts,” said Captain Grumpass; “but don’t put yourselves out.”

The means of communication in London have reached an almost
undesirable state of perfection. With the aid of the snorting train
and the tinkling, two-wheeled “gondola,” we crossed and re-crossed
the town with such celerity that it was barely eleven when we
reappeared on Trinity Wharf with a joint Gladstone and Thorndyke’s
little green case.

The tender had hauled out of Bow Creek, and now lay alongside the
wharf with a great striped can buoy dangling from her derrick, and
Captain Grumpass stood at the gang way, his jolly, red face beaming
with pleasure. The buoy was safely stowed forward, the derrick hauled
up to the mast, the loose shrouds rehooked to the screw-lanyards, and
the steamer, with four jubilant hoots, swung round and shoved her
sharp nose against the incoming tide.

For near upon four hours the ever-widening stream of the “London
River” unfolded its moving panorama. The smoke and smell of Woolwich
Reach gave place to lucid air made soft by the summer haze; the grey
huddle of factories fell away and green levels of cattle-spotted
marsh stretched away to the high land bordering the river valley.
Venerable training ships displayed their chequered hulls by the
wooded shore, and whispered of the days of oak and hemp, when the
tall three-decker, comely and majestic, with her soaring heights of
canvas, like towers of ivory, had not yet given place to the
mud-coloured saucepans that fly the white ensign now-a-days and
devour the substance of the British taxpayer: when a sailor was a
sailor and not a mere seafaring mechanic. Sturdily breasting the
flood tide, the tender threaded her way through the endless
procession of shipping; barges, billy-boys, schooners, brigs; lumpish
Black-seamen, blue-funnelled China tramps, rickety Baltic barques
with twirling windmills, gigantic liners, staggering under a mountain
of top-hamper. Erith, Purfleet, Greenhithe, Grays greeted us and
passed astern. The chimneys of Northfleet, the clustering roofs of
Gravesend, the populous anchorage and the lurking batteries, were
left behind, and, as we swung out of the Lower Hope, the wide expanse
of sea reach spread out before us like a great sheet of blue-shot
satin.

About half-past twelve the ebb overtook us and helped us on our way,
as we could see by the speed with which the distant land slid past,
and the freshening of the air as we passed through it.

But sky and sea were hushed in a summer calm. Balls of fleecy cloud
hung aloft, motionless in the soft blue; the barges drifted on the
tide with drooping sails, and a big, striped bell buoy--surmounted by
a staff and cage and labelled “Shivering Sand”--sat dreaming in the
sun above its motionless reflection, to rouse for a moment as it met
our wash, nod its cage drowsily, utter a Solemn ding-dong, and fall
asleep again.

It was shortly after passing the buoy that the gaunt shape of a
screw-pile lighthouse began to loom up ahead, its dull red paint
turned to vermilion by the early afternoon sun. As we drew nearer,
the name _Girdler_, painted in huge, white letters, became visible,
and two men could be seen in the gallery around the lantern,
inspecting us through a telescope.

“Shall you be long at the lighthouse, sir?” the master of the tender
inquired of Captain Grumpass; “because we’re going down to the
North-East Pan Sand to fix this new buoy and take up the old one.”

“Then you’d better put us off at the lighthouse and come back for us
when you’ve finished the job,” was the reply. “I don’t know how long
we shall be.”

The tender was brought to, a boat lowered, and a couple of hands
pulled us across the intervening space of water.

“It will be a dirty climb for you in your shore-going clothes,” the
captain remarked--he was as spruce as a new pin himself, “but the
stuff will all wipe off.” We looked up at the skeleton shape. The
falling tide had exposed some fifteen feet of the piles, and piles
and ladder alike were swathed in sea-grass and encrusted with
barnacles and worm tubes. But we were not such town-sparrows as the
captain seemed to think, for we both followed his lead without
difficulty up the slippery ladder, Thorndyke clinging tenaciously to
his little green case, from which he refused to be separated even for
an instant.

“These gentlemen and I,” said the captain, as we stepped on the stage
at the head of the ladder, “have come to make inquiries about the
missing man, James Brown. Which of you is Jeffreys?”

“I am, sir,” replied a tall, powerful, square-jawed, beetle-browed
man, whose left hand was tied up in a rough bandage.

“What have you been doing to your hand?” asked the captain.

“I cut it while I was peeling some potatoes,” was the reply. “It
isn’t much of a cut, sir.”

“Well, Jeffreys,” said the captain, “Brown’s body has been picked up
and I want particulars for the inquest. You’ll be summoned as a
witness, I suppose, so come in and tell us all you know.”

We entered the living-room and seated ourselves at the table. The
captain opened a massive pocket-book, while Thorndyke, in his
attentive, inquisitive fashion, looked about the odd, cabin-like room
as if making a mental inventory of its contents.

Jeffreys’ statement added nothing to what we already knew. He had
seen a boat with one man in it making for the lighthouse. Then the
fog had drifted up and he had lost sight of the boat. He started the
fog-horn and kept a bright look-out, but the boat never arrived. And
that was all he knew. He supposed that the man must have missed the
lighthouse and been carried away on the ebb-tide, which was running
strongly at the time.

“What time was it when you last saw the boat?” Thorndyke asked.

“About half-past eleven,” replied Jeffreys.

“What was the man like?” asked the captain.

“I don’t know, sir; he was rowing, and his back was towards me.”

“Had he any kit-bag or chest with him?” asked Thorndyke.

“He’d got his chest with him,” said Jeffreys.

“What sort of chest was it?” inquired Thorndyke.

“A small chest, painted green, with rope beckets.”

“Was it corded?”

“It had a single cord round, to hold the lid down.”

“Where was it stowed?”

“In the stern-sheets, sir.”

“How far off was the boat when you last saw it?”

“About half-a-mile.”

“Half-a-mile!” exclaimed the captain. “Why, how the deuce could you
see that chest half-a-mile away?”

The man reddened and cast a look of angry suspicion at Thorndyke. “I
was watching the boat through the glass, sir,” he replied sulkily.

“I see,” said Captain Grumpass. “Well, that will do, Jeffreys. We
shall have to arrange for you to attend the inquest. Tell Smith I
want to see him.”

The examination concluded, Thorndyke and I moved our chairs to the
window, which looked out over the sea to the east. But it was not the
sea or the passing ships that engaged my colleague’s attention. On
the wall, beside the window, hung a rudely-carved pipe-rack
containing five pipes. Thorndyke had noted it when we entered the
room, and now, as we talked, I observed him regarding it from time to
time with speculative interest.

“You men seem to be inveterate smokers,” he remarked to the keeper,
Smith, when the captain had concluded the arrangements for the
“shift.”

“Well, we do like our bit of ‘baccy, sir, and that’s a fact,”
answered Smith. “You see, sir,” he continued, “it’s a lonely life,
and tobacco’s cheap out here.”

“How is that?” asked Thorndyke.

“Why, we get it given to us. The small craft from foreign, especially
the Dutchmen, generally heave us a cake or two when they pass close.
We’re not ashore, you see, so there’s no duty to pay.”

“So you don’t trouble the tobacconists much? Don’t go in for cut
tobacco?”

“No, sir; we’d have to buy it, and then the cut stuff wouldn’t keep.
No, it’s hard-tack to eat out here and hard tobacco to smoke.”

“I see you’ve got a pipe-rack, too, quite a stylish affair.”

“Yes,” said Smith, “I made it in my off-time. Keeps the place tidy
and looks more ship-shape than letting the pipes lay about anywhere.”

“Some one seems to have neglected his pipe,” said Thorndyke, pointing
to one at the end of the rack which was coated with green mildew.

“Yes; that’s Parsons, my mate. He must have left it when he went off
near a month ago. Pipes do go mouldy in the damp air out here.”

“How soon does a pipe go mouldy if it is left untouched?” Thorndyke
asked.

“It’s according to the weather,” said Smith. “When it’s warm and damp
they’ll begin to go in about a week. Now here’s Barnett’s pipe that
he’s left behind--the man that broke his leg, you know, sir--it’s
just beginning to spot a little. He couldn’t have used it for a day
or two before he went.”

“And are all these other pipes yours?”

“No, sir. This here one is mine. The end one is Jeffreys’, and I
suppose the middle one is his too, but I don’t know it.”

“You’re a demon for pipes, doctor,” said the captain, strolling up at
this moment; “you seem to make a special study of them.”

“‘The proper study of mankind is man,’” replied Thorndyke, as the
keeper retired, “and ‘man’ includes those objects on which his
personality is impressed. Now a pipe is a very personal thing. Look
at that row in the rack. Each has its own physiognomy which, in a
measure, reflects the peculiarities of the owner. There is Jeffreys’
pipe at the end, for instance. The mouthpiece is nearly bitten
through, the bowl scraped to a shell and scored inside and the brim
battered and chipped. The whole thing speaks of rude strength and
rough handling. He chews the stem as he smokes, he scrapes the bowl
violently, and he bangs the ashes out with unnecessary force. And the
man fits the pipe exactly: powerful, square-jawed and, I should say,
violent on occasion.”

“Yes, he looks a tough customer, does Jeffreys,” agreed the captain.

“Then,” continued Thorndyke, “there is Smith’s pipe, next to it;
‘coked’ up until the cavity is nearly filled and burnt all round the
edge; a talker’s pipe, constantly going out and being relit. But the
one that interests me most is the middle one.”

“Didn’t Smith say that was Jeffreys’ too?” I said.

“Yes,” replied Thorndyke, “but he must be mistaken. It is the very
opposite of Jeffreys’ pipe in every respect. To begin with, although
it is an old pipe, there is not a sign of any tooth-mark on the
mouthpiece. It is the only one in the rack that is quite unmarked.
Then the brim is quite uninjured: it has been handled gently, and the
silver band is jet-black, whereas the band on Jeffreys’ pipe is quite
bright.”

“I hadn’t noticed that it had a band,” said the captain. “What has
made it so black?”

Thorndyke lifted the pipe out of the rack and looked at it closely.
“Silver sulphide,” said he, “the sulphur no doubt derived from
something carried in the pocket.”

“I see,” said Captain Grumpass, smothering a yawn and gazing out of
the window at the distant tender. “Incidentally it’s full of tobacco.
What moral do you draw from that?”

Thorndyke turned the pipe over and looked closely at the mouthpiece.
“The moral is,” he replied, “that you should see that your pipe is
clear before you fill it.” He pointed to the mouthpiece, the bore of
which was completely stopped up with fine fluff.

“An excellent moral too,” said the captain, rising with an other
yawn. “If you’ll excuse me a minute I’ll just go and see what the
tender is up to. She seems to be crossing to the East Girdler.” He
reached the telescope down from its brackets and went out onto the
gallery.

As the captain retreated, Thorndyke opened his pocket knife, and,
sticking the blade into the bowl of the pipe, turned the tobacco out
into his hand.

“Shag, by Jove!” I exclaimed.

“Yes,” he answered, poking it back into the bowl. “Didn’t you expect
it to be shag?”

“I don’t know that I expected anything,” I admitted. “The silver band
was occupying my attention.”

“Yes, that is an interesting point,” said Thorndyke, “but let us see
what the obstruction consists of.” He opened the green case, and,
taking out a dissecting needle, neatly extracted a little ball of
fluff from the bore of the pipe. Laying this on a glass slide, he
teased it out in a drop of glycerine and put on a cover-glass while I
set up the microscope.

“Better put the pipe back in the rack,” he said, as he laid the slide
on the stage of the instrument. I did so and then turned, with no
little excitement, to watch him as he examined the specimen. After a
brief inspection he rose and waved his hand towards the microscope.

“Take a look at it, Jervis,” he said.

I applied my eye to the instrument, and, moving the slide about,
identified the constituents of the little mass of fluff. The
ubiquitous cotton fibre was, of course, in evidence, and a few fibres
of wool, but the most remarkable objects were two or three
hairs--very minute hairs of a definite zigzag shape and having a flat
expansion near the free end like the blade of a paddle.

“These are the hairs of some small animal,” I said; “not a mouse or
rat or any rodent, I should say. Some small insectivorous animal, I
fancy. Yes! Of course! They are the hairs of a mole.” I stood up,
and, as the importance of the discovery flashed on me, I looked at my
colleague in silence.

“Yes,” he said, “they are unmistakable; and they furnish the keystone
of the argument.”

“You think that this is really the dead man’s pipe, then?” I said.

“According to the law of multiple evidence,” he replied, “it is
practically a certainty. Consider the facts in sequence. Since there
is no sign of mildew on it, this pipe can have been here only a short
time, and must belong either to Barnett, Smith, Jeffreys or Brown. It
is an old pipe, but it has no tooth-marks on it. Therefore it has
been used by a man who has no teeth. But Barnett, Smith and Jeffreys
all have teeth and mark their pipes, whereas Brown has no teeth. The
tobacco in it is shag. But these three men do not smoke shag, whereas
Brown had shag in his pouch. The silver band is encrusted with
sulphide; and Brown carried sulphur-tipped matches loose in his
pocket with his pipe. We find hairs of a mole in the bore of the
pipe; and Brown carried a mole skin pouch in the pocket in which he
appears to have carried his pipe. Finally, Brown’s pocket contained a
pipe which was obviously not his and which closely resembled that of
Jeffreys; it contained tobacco similar to that which Jeffreys smokes
and different from that in Brown’s pouch. It appears to me quite
conclusive, especially when we add to this evidence the other items
that are in our possession.”

“What items are they?” I asked.

“First there is the fact that the dead man had knocked his head
heavily against some periodically submerged body covered with acorn
barnacles and serpulæ. Now the piles of this lighthouse answer to the
description exactly, and there are no other bodies in the
neighbourhood that do: for even the beacons are too large to have
produced that kind of wound. Then the dead man’s sheath-knife is
missing, and Jeffreys has a knife-wound on his hand. You must admit
that the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.”

At this moment the captain bustled into the room with the telescope
in his hand. “The tender is coming up towing a strange boat,” he
said. “I expect it’s the missing one, and, if it is, we may learn
something. You’d better pack up your traps and get ready to go on
board.”

We packed the green case and went out into the gallery, where the two
keepers were watching the approaching tender; Smith frankly curious
and interested, Jeffreys restless, fidgety and noticeably pale. As
the steamer came opposite the lighthouse, three men dropped into the
boat and pulled across, and one of them--the mate of the tender--came
climbing up the ladder.

“Is that the missing boat?” the captain sang out.

“Yes, sir,” answered the officer, stepping onto the staging and
wiping his hands on the reverse aspect of his trousers, “we saw her
lying on the dry patch of the East Girdler. There’s been some
hanky-panky in this job, sir.”

“Foul play, you think, hey?”

“Not a doubt of it, sir. The plug was out and lying loose in the
bottom, and we found a sheath-knife sticking into the kelson forward
among the coils of the painter. It was stuck in hard as if it had
dropped from a height.”

“That’s odd,” said the captain. “As to the plug, it might have got
out by accident.”

“But it hadn’t sir,” said the mate. “The ballast-bags had been
shifted along to get the bottom boards up. Besides, sir, a seaman
wouldn’t let the boat fill; he’d have put the plug back and baled
out.”

“That’s true,” replied Captain Grumpass; “and certainly the presence
of the knife looks fishy. But where the deuce could it have dropped
from, out in the open sea? Knives don’t drop from the
clouds--fortunately. What do you say, doctor?”

“I should say that it is Brown’s own knife, and that it probably fell
from this staging.”

Jeffreys turned swiftly, crimson with wrath. “What d’ye mean?” he
demanded. “Haven’t I said that the boat never came here?”

“You have,” replied Thorndyke; “but if that is so, how do you explain
the fact that your pipe was found in the dead man’s pocket and that
the dead man’s pipe is at this moment in your pipe-rack?”

The crimson flush on Jeffreys’ face faded as quickly as it had come.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he faltered.

“I’ll tell you,” said Thorndyke. “I will relate what happened and you
shall check my statements. Brown brought his boat alongside and came
up into the living-room, bringing his chest with him. He filled his
pipe and tried to light it, but it was stopped and wouldn’t draw.
Then you lent him a pipe of yours and filled it for him. Soon
afterwards you came out on this staging and quarrelled. Brown
defended himself with his knife, which dropped from his hand into the
boat. You pushed him off the staging and he fell, knocking his head
on one of the piles. Then you took the plug out of the boat and sent
her adrift to sink, and you flung the chest into the sea. This
happened about ten minutes past twelve. Am I right?”

Jeffreys stood staring at Thorndyke, the picture of amazement and
consternation; but he uttered no word in reply.

“Am I right?” Thorndyke repeated.

“Strike me blind!” muttered Jeffreys. “Was you here, then? You talk
as if you had been. Anyhow,” he continued, recovering somewhat, “you
seem to know all about it. But you’re wrong about one thing. There
was no quarrel. This chap, Brown, didn’t take to me and he didn’t
mean to stay out here. He was going to put off and go ashore again
and I wouldn’t let him. Then he hit out at me with his knife and I
knocked it out of his hand and he staggered backwards and went
overboard.”

“And did you try to pick him up?” asked the captain.

“How could I,” demanded Jeffreys, “with the tide racing down and me
alone on the station? I’d never have got back.”

“But what about the boat, Jeffreys? Why did you scuttle her?”

“The fact is,” replied Jeffreys, “I got in a funk, and I thought the
simplest plan was to send her to the cellar and know nothing about
it. But I never shoved him over. It was an accident, sir; I swear it!”

“Well, that sounds a reasonable explanation,” said the captain. “What
do you say, doctor?”

“Perfectly reasonable,” replied Thorndyke, “and, as to its truth,
that is no affair of ours.”

“No. But I shall have to take you off, Jeffreys, and hand you over to
the police. You understand that?”

“Yes, sir, I understand,” answered Jeffreys.

“That was a queer case, that affair on the Girdler,” remarked Captain
Grumpass, when he was spending an evening with us some six months
later. “A pretty easy let off for Jeffreys, too--eighteen months,
wasn’t it?”

“Yes, it was a very queer case indeed,” said Thorndyke. “There was
something behind that ‘accident,’ I should say. Those men had
probably met before.”

“So I thought,” agreed the captain. “But the queerest part of it to
me was the way you nosed it all out. I’ve had a deep respect for
briar pipes since then. It was a remarkable case,” he continued. “The
way in which you made that pipe tell the story of the murder seems to
me like sheer enchantment.”

“Yes,” said I, “it spoke like the magic pipe--only that wasn’t a
tobacco-pipe--in the German folk-story of the ‘Singing Bone.’ Do you
remember it? A peasant found the bone of a murdered man and fashioned
it into a pipe. But when he tried to play on it, it burst into a song
of its own--

_‘My brother slew me and buried my bones Beneath the sand and under
the stones.’”_

“A pretty story,” said Thorndyke, “and one with an excellent moral.
The inanimate things around us have each of them a song to sing to us
if we are but ready with attentive ears.”




A WASTREL’S ROMANCE


PART I

THE SPINSTERS’ GUEST

The lingering summer twilight was fast merging into night as a
solitary cyclist, whose evening-dress suit was thinly disguised by an
overcoat, rode slowly along a pleasant country road. From time to
time he had been overtaken and passed by a carriage, a car or a
closed cab from the adjacent town, and from the festive garb of the
occupants he had made shrewd guesses at their destination. His own
objective was a large house, standing in somewhat extensive grounds
just off the road, and the peculiar circumstances that surrounded his
visit to it caused him to ride more and more slowly as he approached
his goal.

Willowdale--such was the name of the house--was, to-night, witnessing
a temporary revival of its past glories. For many months it had been
empty and a notice-board by the gate-keeper’s lodge had silently
announced its forlorn state; but to-night, its rooms, their bare
walls clothed in flags and draperies, their floors waxed or carpeted,
would once more echo the sound of music and cheerful voices and
vibrate to the tread of many feet. For on this night the spinsters of
Raynesford were giving a dance; and chief amongst the spinsters was
Miss Halliwell, the owner of Willowdale.

It was a great occasion. The house was large and imposing; the
spinsters were many and their purses were long. The guests were
numerous and distinguished, and included no less a person than Mrs.
Jehu B. Chater. This was the crowning triumph of the function, for
the beautiful American widow was the lion (or should we say lioness?)
of the season. Her wealth was, if not beyond the dreams of avarice,
at least beyond the powers of common British arithmetic, and her
diamonds were, at once, the glory and the terror of her hostesses.

All these attractions notwithstanding, the cyclist approached the
vicinity of Willowdale with a slowness almost hinting at reluctance;
and when, at length, a curve of the road brought the gates into view,
he dismounted and halted irresolutely. He was about to do a rather
risky thing, and, though by no means a man of weak nerve, he
hesitated to make the plunge.

The fact is, he had not been invited.

Why, then, was he going? And how was he to gain admittance? To which
questions the answer involves a painful explanation.

Augustus Bailey lived by his wits. That is the common phrase, and a
stupid phrase it is. For do we not all live by our wits, if we have
any? And does it need any specially brilliant wits to be a common
rogue? However, such as his wits were, Augustus Bailey lived by them,
and he had not hitherto made a fortune.

The present venture arose out of a conversation overheard at a
restaurant table and an invitation-card carelessly laid down and
adroitly covered with the menu. Augustus had accepted the invitation
that he had not received (on a sheet of Hotel Cecil notepaper that he
had among his collection of stationery) in the name of Geoffrey
Harrington-Baillie; and the question that exercised his mind at the
moment was, would he or would he not be spotted? He had trusted to
the number of guests and the probable inexperience of the hostesses.
He knew that the cards need not be shown, though there was the
awkward ceremony of announcement.

But perhaps it wouldn’t get as far as that. Probably not, if his
acceptance had been detected as emanating from an uninvited stranger.

He walked slowly towards the gates with growing discomfort. Added to
his nervousness as to the present were certain twinges of
reminiscence. He had once held a commission in a line regiment--not
for long, indeed; his “wits” had been too much for his brother
officers--but there had been a time when he would have come to such a
gathering as this an invited guest. Now, a common thief, he was
sneaking in under a false name, with a fair prospect of being
ignominiously thrown out by the servants.

As he stood hesitating, the sound of hoofs on the road was followed
by the aggressive bellow of a motor-horn. The modest twinkle of
carriage lamps appeared round the curve and then the glare of
acetylene headlights. A man came out of the lodge and drew open the
gates; and Mr. Bailey, taking his courage in both hands, boldly
trundled his machine up the drive.

Half-way up--it was quite a steep incline--the car whizzed by; a
large Napier filled with a bevy of young men who economized space by
sitting on the backs of the seats and on one another’s knees. Bailey
looked at them and decided that this was his chance, and, pushing
forward, he saw his bicycle safely bestowed in the empty coach-house
and then hurried on to the cloak-room. The young men had arrived
there before him and, as he entered, were gaily peeling off their
over coats and flinging them down on a table. Bailey followed their
example, and, in his eagerness to enter the reception room with the
crowd, let his attention wander from the business of the moment, and,
as he pocketed the ticket and hurried away, he failed to notice that
the bewildered attendant had put his hat with another man’s coat and
affixed his duplicate to them both.

“Major Podbury, Captain Barker-Jones, Captain Sparker, Mr. Watson,
Mr. Goldsmith, Mr. Smart, _Mr. Harrington Baillie!_’

As Augustus swaggered up the room, hugging the party of officers and
quaking inwardly, he was conscious that his hostesses glanced from
one man to another with more than common interest.

But at that moment the footman’s voice rang out, sonorous and clear--

“Mrs. Chater, Colonel Crumpler!” and, as all eyes were turned towards
the new arrivals, Augustus made his bow and passed into the throng.
His little game of bluff had “come off,” after all.

He withdrew modestly into the more crowded portion of the room, and
there took up a position where he would be shielded from the gaze of
his hostesses. Presently, he reflected, they would forget him, if
they had really thought about him at all, and then he would see what
could be done in the way of business. He was still rather shaky, and
wondered how soon it would be decent to steady his nerves with a
“refresher.” Meanwhile he kept a sharp look-out over the shoulders of
neighbouring guests, until a movement in the crowd of guests
disclosed Mrs. Chater shaking hands with the presiding spinster. Then
Augustus got a most uncommon surprise.

He knew her at the first glance. He had a good memory for faces, and
Mrs. Chater’s face was one to remember. Well did he recall the frank
and lovely American girl with whom he had danced at the regimental
ball years ago. That was in the old days when he was a subaltern, and
before that little affair of the pricked court-cards that brought his
military career to an end. They had taken a mutual liking, he
remembered, that sweet-faced Yankee maid and he; had danced many
dances and had sat out others, to talk mystical nonsense which, in
their innocence, they had believed to be philosophy. He had never
seen her since. She had come into his life and gone out of it again,
and he had forgotten her name, if he had ever known it. But here she
was, middle aged now, it was true, but still beautiful and a great
personage withal. And, ye gods! what diamonds! And here was he, too,
a common rogue, lurking in the crowd that he might, perchance, snatch
a pendant or “pinch” a loose brooch.

Perhaps she might recognize him. Why not? He had recognized her. But
that would never do. And thus reflecting, Mr. Bailey slipped out to
stroll on the lawn and smoke a cigarette. Another man, somewhat older
than himself, was pacing to and fro thoughtfully, glancing from time
to time through the open windows into the brilliantly-lighted rooms.
When they had passed once or twice, the stranger halted and addressed
him.

“This is the best place on a night like this,” he remarked; “it’s
getting hot inside already. But perhaps you’re keen on dancing.”

“Not so keen as I used to be,” replied Bailey; and then, observing
the hungry look that the other man was bestowing on his cigarette, he
produced his case and offered it.

“Thanks awfully!” exclaimed the stranger, pouncing with avidity on
the open case. “Good Samaritan, by Jove. Left my case in my overcoat.
Hadn’t the cheek to ask, though I was starving for a smoke.” He
inhaled luxuriously, and, blowing out a cloud of smoke, resumed:
“These chits seem to be running the show pretty well, h’m? Wouldn’t
take it for an empty house to look at it, would you?”

“I have hardly seen it,” said Bailey; “only just come, you know.”

“We’ll have a look round, if you like,” said the genial stranger,
“when we’ve finished our smoke, that is. Have a drink too; may cool
us a bit. Know many people here?”

“Not a soul,” replied Bailey. “My hostess doesn’t seem to have turned
up.”

“Well, that’s easily remedied,” said the stranger. “My daughter’s one
of the spinsters--Granby, my name; when we’ve had a drink, I’ll make
her find you a partner--that is, if you care for the light fantastic.”

“I should like a dance or two,” said Bailey, “though I’m getting a
bit past it now, I suppose. Still, it doesn’t do to chuck up the
sponge prematurely.”

“Certainly not,” Granby agreed jovially; “a man’s as young as he
feels. Well, come and have a drink and then we’ll hunt up my little
girl.” The two men flung away the stumps of their cigarettes and
headed for the refreshments.

The spinsters’ champagne was light, but it was well enough if taken
in sufficient quantity; a point to which Augustus--and Granby
too--paid judicious attention; and when he had supplemented the wine
with a few sandwiches, Mr. Bailey felt in notably better spirits.
For, to tell the truth, his diet, of late, had been somewhat meagre.
Miss Granby, when found, proved to be a blonde and guileless
“flapper” of some seventeen summers, childishly eager to play her
part of hostess with due dignity; and presently Bailey found himself
gyrating through the eddying crowd in company with a comely matron of
thirty or thereabouts.

The sensations that this novel experience aroused rather took him by
surprise. For years past he had been living a precarious life of mean
and sordid shifts that oscillated between mere shabby trickery and
downright crime; now conducting a paltry swindle just inside the pale
of the law, and now, when hard pressed, descending to actual theft;
consorting with shady characters, swindlers and knaves and scurvy
rogues like himself; gambling, borrowing, cadging and, if need be,
stealing, and always slinking abroad with an apprehensive eye upon
“the man in blue.”

And now, amidst the half-forgotten surroundings, once so familiar;
the gaily-decorated rooms, the rhythmic music, the twinkle of jewels,
the murmur of gliding feet and the rustle of costly gowns, the moving
vision of honest gentlemen and fair ladies; the shameful years seemed
to drop away and leave him to take up the thread of his life where it
had snapped so disastrously. After all, these were his own people.
The seedy knaves in whose steps he had walked of late were but aliens
met by the way.

He surrendered his partner, in due course, with regret--which was
mutual--to an inarticulate subaltern, and was meditating another
pilgrimage to the refreshment-room, when he felt a light touch upon
his arm. He turned swiftly. A touch on the arm meant more to him than
to some men. But it was no wooden-faced plain-clothes man that he
confronted; it was only a lady. In short, it was Mrs. Chater, smiling
nervously and a little abashed by her own boldness.

“I expect you’ve forgotten me,” she began apologetically, but
Augustus interrupted her with an eager disclaimer.

“Of course I haven’t,” he said; “though I have forgotten your name,
but I remember that Portsmouth dance as well as if it were yesterday;
at least one incident in it--the only one that was worth remembering.
I’ve often hoped that I might meet you again, and now, at last, it
has happened.”

“It’s nice of you to remember,” she rejoined. “I’ve often and often
thought of that evening and all the wonderful things that we talked
about. You were a nice boy then; I wonder what you are like now. What
a long time ago it is!”

“Yes,” Augustus agreed gravely, “it _is_ a long time. I know it
myself; but when I look at you, it seems as if it could only have
been last season.”

“Oh, fie!” she exclaimed. “You are not simple as you used to be. You
didn’t flatter then; but perhaps there wasn’t the need.” She spoke
with gentle reproach, but her pretty face flushed with pleasure
nevertheless, and there was a certain wistfulness in the tone of her
concluding sentence.

“I wasn’t flattering,” Augustus replied, quite sincerely; “I knew you
directly you entered the room and marvelled that Time had been so
gentle with you. He hasn’t been as kind to me.”

“No. You have gotten a few grey hairs, I see, but after all, what are
grey hairs to a man? Just the badges of rank, like the crown on your
collar or the lace on your cuffs, to mark the steps of your
promotion--for I guess you’ll be a colonel by now.”

“No,” Augustus answered quickly, with a faint flush, “I left the army
some years ago.”

“My! what a pity!” exclaimed Mrs. Chater. “You must tell me all about
it--but not now. My partner will be looking for me. We will sit out a
dance and have a real gossip. But I’ve forgotten your name--never
could recall it, in fact, though that didn’t prevent me from
remembering you; but, as our dear W. S. remarks, ‘What’s in a name?’”

“Ah, indeed,” said Mr. Harrington-Baillie; and apropos of that
sentiment, he added: “Mine is Rowland--Captain Rowland. You may
remember it now.”

Mrs. Chater did not, however, and said so. “Will number six do?” she
asked, opening her programme; and, when Augustus had assented, she
entered his provisional name, remarking complacently: “We’ll sit out
and have a right-down good talk, and you shall tell me all about
yourself and if you still think the same about free-will and personal
responsibility. You had very lofty ideals, I remember, in those days,
and I hope you have still. But one’s ideals get rubbed down rather
faint in the friction of life. Don’t you think so?”

“Yes, I am afraid you’re right,” Augustus assented gloomily. “The
wear and tear of life soon fetches the gilt off the gingerbread.
Middle age is apt to find us a bit patchy, not to say naked.”

“Oh, don’t be pessimistic,” said Mrs. Chater; “that is the attitude
of the disappointed idealist, and I am sure you have no reason,
really, to be disappointed in yourself. But I must run away now.
Think over all the things you have to tell me, and don’t forget that
it is number six.” With a bright smile and a friendly nod she sailed
away, a vision of glittering splendour, compared with which Solomon
in all his glory was a mere matter of commonplace bullion.

The interview, evidently friendly and familiar, between the unknown
guest and the famous American widow had by no means passed unnoticed;
and in other circumstances, Bailey might have endeavoured to profit
by the reflected glory that enveloped him. But he was not in search
of notoriety; and the same evasive instinct that had led him to sink
Mr. Harrington-Baillie in Captain Rowland, now advised him to
withdraw his dual personality from the vulgar gaze. He had come here
on very definite business. For the hundredth time he was
“stony-broke,” and it was the hope of picking up some “unconsidered
trifles” that had brought him. But, somehow, the atmosphere of the
place had proved unfavourable. Either opportunities were lacking or
he failed to seize them. In any case, the game pocket that formed an
unconventional feature of his dress-coat was still empty, and it
looked as if a pleasant evening and a good supper were all that he
was likely to get. Nevertheless, be his conduct never so blameless,
the fact remained that he was an uninvited guest, liable at any
moment to be ejected as an impostor, and his recognition by the widow
had not rendered this possibility any the more remote.

He strayed out onto the lawn, whence the grounds fell away on all
sides. But there were other guests there, cooling themselves after
the last dance, and the light from the rooms streamed through the
windows, illuminating their figures, and among them, that of the
too-companionable Granby. Augustus quickly drew away from the lighted
area, and, chancing upon a narrow path, strolled away along it in the
direction of a copse or shrubbery that he saw ahead. Presently he
came to an ivy-covered arch, lighted by one or two fairy lamps, and,
passing through this, he entered a winding path, bordered by trees
and shrubs and but faintly lighted by an occasional coloured lamp
suspended from a branch.

Already he was quite clear of the crowd; indeed, the deserted
condition of the pleasant retreat rather surprised him, until he
reflected that to couples desiring seclusion there were whole ranges
of untenanted rooms and galleries available in the empty house.

The path sloped gently downwards for some distance; then came a long
flight of rustic steps and, at the bottom, a seat between two trees.
In front of the seat the path extended in a straight line, forming a
narrow terrace; on the right the ground sloped up steeply towards the
lawn; on the left it fell away still more steeply towards the
encompassing wall of the grounds; and on both sides it was covered
with trees and shrubs.

Bailey sat down on the seat to think over the account of himself that
he should present to Mrs. Chater. It was a comfortable seat, built
into the trunk of an elm, which formed one end and part of the back.
He leaned against the tree, and, taking out his silver case, selected
a cigarette. But it remained unlighted between his fingers as he sat
and meditated upon his unsatisfactory past and the melancholy tale of
what might have been. Fresh from the atmosphere of refined opulence
that pervaded the dancing-rooms, the throng of well-groomed men and
dainty women, his mind travelled back to his sordid little flat in
Bermondsey, encompassed by poverty and squalor, jostled by lofty
factories, grimy with the smoke of the river and the reek from the
great chimneys. It was a hideous contrast. Verily the way of the
transgressor was not strewn with flowers.

At that point in his meditations he caught the sound of voices and
footsteps on the path above and rose to walk on along the path. He
did not wish to be seen wandering alone in the shrubbery. But now a
woman’s laugh sounded from somewhere down the path. There were people
approaching that way too. He put the cigarette back in the case and
stepped round behind the seat, intending to retreat in that
direction, but here the path ended, and beyond was nothing but a
rugged slope down to the wall thickly covered with bushes. And while
he was hesitating, the sound of feet descending the steps and the
rustle of a woman’s dress left him to choose between staying where he
was or coming out to confront the newcomers. He chose the former,
drawing up close behind the tree to wait until they should have
passed on.

But they were not going to pass on. One of them--a woman--sat down on
the seat, and then a familiar voice smote on his ear. “I guess I’ll
rest here quietly for a while; this tooth of mine is aching terribly;
and, see here, I want you to go and fetch me something. Take this
ticket to the cloak-room and tell the woman to give you my little
velvet bag. You’ll find in it a bottle of chloroform and a packet of
cotton-wool.”

“But I can’t leave you here all alone, Mrs. Chater,” her partner
expostulated.

“I’m not hankering for society just now,” said Mrs. Chater. “I want
that chloroform. Just you hustle off and fetch it, like a good boy.
Here’s the ticket.”

The young officer’s footsteps retreated rapidly, and the voices of
the couple advancing along the path grew louder. Bailey, cursing the
chance that had placed him in his ridiculous and uncomfortable
position, heard them approach and pass on up the steps; and then all
was silent, save for an Occasional moan from Mrs. Chater and the
measured creaking of the seat as she rocked uneasily to and fro. But
the young man was uncommonly prompt in the discharge of his mission,
and in a very few minutes Bailey heard him approaching at a run along
the path above and then bounding down the steps.

“Now I call that real good of you,” said the widow gratefully. “You
must have run like the wind. Cut the string of the packet and then
leave me to wrestle with this tooth.”

“But I can’t leave you here all----”

“Yes, you can,” interrupted Mrs. Chater. “There won’t be any one
about--the next dance is a waltz. Besides, you must go and find your
partner.”

“Well, if you’d really rather be alone,” the subaltern began; but
Mrs. Chater interrupted him.

“Of course I would, when I’m fixing up my teeth. Now go along, and a
thousand thanks for your kindness.”

With mumbled protestations the young officer slowly retired, and
Bailey heard his reluctant feet ascending the steps. Then a deep
silence fell on the place in which the rustle of paper and the squeak
of a withdrawn cork seemed loud and palpable. Bailey had turned with
his face towards the tree, against which he leaned with his lips
parted scarcely daring to breathe. He cursed himself again and again
for having thus entrapped himself for no tangible reason, and longed
to get away. But there was no escape now without betraying himself.
He must wait for the woman to go.

Suddenly, beyond the edge of the tree, a hand appeared holding an
open packet of cotton-wool. It laid the wool down on the seat, and,
pinching off a fragment, rolled it into a tiny ball. The fingers of
the hand were encircled by rings, its wrist enclosed by a broad
bracelet; and from rings and bracelet the light of the solitary
fairy-lamp, that hung from a branch of the tree, was reflected in
prismatic sparks. The hand was withdrawn and Bailey stared dreamily
at the square pad of cotton-wool. Then the hand came again into view.
This time it held a small phial which it laid softly on the seat,
setting the cork beside it. And again the light flashed in
many-coloured scintillations from the encrusting gems.

Bailey’s knees began to tremble, and a chilly moisture broke out upon
his forehead.

The hand drew back, but, as it vanished, Bailey moved his head
silently until his face emerged from behind the tree. The woman was
leaning back, her head resting against the trunk only a few inches
away from his face. The great stones of the tiara flashed in his very
eyes. Over her shoulder, he could even see the gorgeous pendant,
rising and falling on her bosom with ever-changing fires; and both
her raised hands were a mass of glitter and sparkle, only the deeper
and richer for the subdued light.

His heart throbbed with palpable blows that drummed aloud in his
ears. The sweat trickled clammily down his face, and he clenched his
teeth to keep them from chattering. An agony of horror--of deadly
fear--was creeping over him--a terror of the dreadful impulse that
was stealing away his reason and his will.

The silence was profound. The woman’s soft breathing, the creak of
her bodice, were plainly--grossly--audible; and he checked his own
breath until he seemed on the verge of suffocation.

Of a sudden through the night air was borne faintly the dreamy music
of a waltz. The dance had begun. The distant sound but deepened the
sense of solitude in this deserted spot.

Bailey listened intently. He yearned to escape from the invisible
force that seemed to be clutching at his wrists, and dragging him
forward inexorably to his doom.

He gazed down at the woman with a horrid fascination. He struggled to
draw back out of sight--and struggled in vain.

Then, at last, with a horrible, stealthy deliberation, a clammy,
shaking hand crept forward towards the seat. Without a sound it
grasped the wool, and noiselessly, slowly drew back. Again it stole
forth. The fingers twined snakily around the phial, lifted it from
the seat and carried it back into the shadow.

After a few seconds it reappeared and softly replaced the bottle--now
half empty. There was a brief pause. The measured cadences of the
waltz stole softly through the quiet night and seemed to keep time
with the woman’s breathing. Other sound there was none. The place was
wrapped in the silence of the grave.

Suddenly, from the hiding-place, Bailey leaned forward over the back
of the seat. The pad of cotton-wool was in his hand.

The woman was now leaning back as if dozing, and her hands rested in
her lap. There was a swift movement. The pad was pressed against her
face and her head dragged back against the chest of the invisible
assailant. A smothered gasp burst from her hidden lips as her hands
flew up to clutch at the murderous arm; and then came a frightful
struggle, made even more frightful by the gay and costly trappings of
the writhing victim. And still there was hardly a sound; only muffled
gasps, the rustle of silk, the creaking of the seat, the clink of the
falling bottle and, afar off, with dreadful irony, the dreamy murmur
of the waltz.

The struggle was but brief. Quite suddenly the jewelled hands
dropped, the head lay resistless on the crumpled shirt-front, and the
body, now limp and inert, began to slip forward off the seat. Bailey,
still grasping the passive head, climbed over the back of the seat
and, as the woman slid gently to the ground, he drew away the pad and
stooped over her. The struggle was over now; the mad fury of the
moment was passing swiftly into the chill of mortal fear.

He stared with incredulous horror into the swollen face, but now so
comely, the sightless eyes that but a little while since had smiled
into his with such kindly recognition.

He had done this! He, the sneaking wastrel, discarded of all the
world, to whom this sweet woman had held out the hand of friendship.
She had cherished his memory, when to all others he was sunk deep
under the waters of oblivion. And he had killed her--for to his ear
no breath of life seemed to issue from those purple lips.

A sudden hideous compunction for this irrevocable thing that he had
done surged through him, and he stood up clutching at his damp hair
with a hoarse cry that was like the cry of the damned.

The jewels passed straightaway out of his consciousness. Everything
was forgotten now but the horror of this unspeakable thing that he
had done. Remorse incurable and haunting fear were all that were left
to him.

The sound of voices far away along the path aroused him, and the
vague horror that possessed him materialized into abject bodily fear.
He lifted the limp body to the edge of the path and let it slip down
the steep declivity among the bushes. A soft, shuddering sigh came
from the parted lips as the body turned over, and he paused a moment
to listen. But there was no other sound of life. Doubtless that sigh
was only the result of the passive movement.

Again he stood for an instant as one in a dream, gazing at the
huddled shape half hidden by the bushes, before he climbed back to
the path; and even then he looked back once more, but now she was
hidden from sight. And, as the voices drew nearer, he turned, and ran
up the rustic steps.

As he came out on the edge of the lawn the music ceased, and, almost
immediately, a stream of people issued from the house. Shaken as he
was, Bailey yet had wits enough left to know that his clothes and
hair were disordered and that his appearance must be wild.
Accordingly he avoided the dancers, and, keeping to the margin of the
lawn, made his way to the cloak-room by the least frequented route.
If he had dared, he would have called in at the refreshment-room, for
he was deadly faint and his limbs shook as he walked. But a haunting
fear pursued him and, indeed, grew from moment to moment. He found
himself already listening for the rumour of the inevitable discovery.

He staggered into the cloak-room, and, flinging his ticket down on
the table, dragged out his watch. The attendant looked at him
curiously and, pausing with the ticket in his hand, asked
sympathetically: “Not feeling very well, sir?”

“No,” said Bailey. “So beastly hot in there.”

“You ought to have a glass of champagne, sir, before you start,” said
the man.

“No time,” replied Bailey, holding out a shaky hand for his coat.
“Shall lose my train if I’m not sharp.”

At this hint the attendant reached down the coat and hat, holding up
the former for its owner to slip his arms into the sleeves. But
Bailey snatched it from him, and, flinging it over his arm, put on
his hat and hurried away to the coach-house. Here, again, the
attendant stared at him in astonishment, which was not lessened when
Bailey, declining his offer to help him on with his coat, bundled the
latter under his arm, clicked the lever of the “variable” on to the
ninety gear, sprang onto the machine and whirled away down the steep
drive, a grotesque vision of flying coat-tails.

“You haven’t lit your lamp, sir,” roared the attendant; but Bailey’s
ears were deaf to all save the clamour of the expected pursuit.

Fortunately the drive entered the road obliquely, or Bailey must have
been flung into the opposite hedge. As it was, the machine, rushing
down the slope, flew out into the road with terrific velocity; nor
did its speed diminish then, for its rider, impelled by mortal
terror, trod the pedals with the fury of a madman. And still, as the
machine whizzed along the dark and silent road, his ears were
strained to catch the clatter of hoofs or the throb of a motor from
behind.

He knew the country well, in fact, as a precaution, he had cycled
over the district only the day before; and he was ready, at any
suspicious sound, to slip down any of the lanes or byways, secure of
finding his way. But still he sped on, and still no sound from the
rear came to tell him of the dread discovery.

When he had ridden about three miles, he came to the foot of a steep
hill. Here he had to dismount and push his machine up the incline,
which he did at such speed that he arrived at the top quite
breathless. Before mounting again he determined to put on his coat,
for his appearance was calculated to attract attention, if nothing
more. It was only half-past eleven, and presently he would pass
through the streets of a small town. Also he would light his lamp. It
would be fatal to be stopped by a patrol or rural constable.

Having lit his lamp and hastily put on his coat he once more listened
intently, looking back over the country that was darkly visible from
the summit of the hill. No moving lights were to be seen, no ringing
hoofs or throbbing engines to be heard, and, turning to mount, he
instinctively felt in his overcoat pocket for his gloves.

A pair of gloves came out in his hand, but he was instantly conscious
that they were not his. A silk muffler was there also; a white one.
But his muffler was black.

With a sudden shock of terror he thrust his hand into the
ticket-pocket, where he had put his latch-key. There was no key
there; only an amber cigar-holder, which he had never seen before. He
stood for a few moments in utter consternation. He had taken the
wrong coat. Then he had left his own coat behind. A cold sweat of
fear broke out afresh on his face as he realized this. His Yale
latch-key was in its pocket; not that that mattered very much. He had
a duplicate at home, and, as to getting in, well, he knew his own
outside door and his tool-bag contained one or two trifles not
usually found in cyclists’ tool-bags. The question was whether that
coat contained anything that could disclose his identity. And then
suddenly he remembered, with a gasp of relief, that he had carefully
turned the pockets out before starting.

No; once let him attain the sanctuary of his grimy little flat,
wedged in as it was between the great factories by the river-side,
and he would be safe: safe from everything but the horror of himself,
and the haunting vision of a jewelled figure huddled up in a silken
heap beneath the bushes.

With a last look round he mounted his machine, and, driving it over
the brow of the hill, swept away into the darkness.


PART II

MUNERA PULVERIS

(_Related by Christopher Jervis, M.D._)

It is one of the drawbacks of medicine as a profession that one is
never rid of one’s responsibilities. The merchant, the lawyer, the
civil servant, each at the appointed time locks up his desk, puts on
his hat and goes forth a free man with an interval of uninterrupted
leisure before him. Not so the doctor. Whether at work or at play,
awake or asleep, he is the servant of humanity, at the instant
disposal of friend or stranger alike whose need may make the
necessary claim.

When I agreed to accompany my wife to the spinsters’ dance at
Raynesford, I imagined that, for that evening, at least, I was
definitely off duty; and in that belief I continued until the
conclusion of the eighth dance. To be quite truthful, I was not sorry
when the delusion was shattered. My last partner was a young lady of
a slanginess of speech that verged on the inarticulate. Now it is not
easy to exchange ideas in “pidgin” English; and the conversation of a
person to whom all things are either “ripping” or “rotten” is apt to
lack subtlety. In fact, I was frankly bored; and, reflecting on the
utility of the humble sandwich as an aid to conversation, I was about
to entice my partner to the refreshment room when I felt some one
pluck at my sleeve. I turned quickly and looked into the anxious and
rather frightened face of my wife.

“Miss Halliwell is looking for you,” she said. “A lady has been taken
ill. Will you come and see what is the matter?” She took my arm and,
when I had made my apologies to my partner, she hurried me on to the
lawn.

“It’s a mysterious affair,” my wife continued. “The sick lady is a
Mrs. Chater, a very wealthy American widow. Edith Halliwell and Major
Podbury found her lying in the shrubbery all alone and unable to give
any account of herself. Poor Edith is dreadfully upset. She doesn’t
know what to think.”

“What do you mean?” I began; but at this moment Miss Halliwell, who
was waiting by an ivy-covered rustic arch, espied us and ran forward.

“Oh, do hurry, please, Dr. Jervis,” she exclaimed; “such a shocking
thing has happened. Has Juliet told you?” Without waiting for an
answer, she darted through the arch and preceded us along a narrow
path at the curious, flat-footed, shambling trot common to most adult
women. Presently we descended a flight of rustic steps which brought
us to a seat, from whence extended a straight path cut like a
miniature terrace on a steep slope, with a high bank rising to the
right and declivity falling away to the left. Down in the hollow, his
head and shoulders appearing above the bushes, was a man holding in
his hand a fairy-lamp that he had apparently taken down from a tree.
I climbed down to him, and, as I came round the bushes, I perceived a
richly-dressed woman lying huddled on the ground. She was not
completely insensible, for she moved slightly at my approach,
muttering a few words in thick, indistinct accents. I took the lamp
from the man, whom I assumed to be Major Podbury, and, as he
delivered it to me with a significant glance and a faint lift of the
eyebrows, I understood Miss Halliwell’s agitation.

Indeed, for one horrible moment I thought that she was right--that
the prostrate woman was intoxicated. But when I approached nearer,
the flickering light of the lamp made visible a square reddened patch
on her face, like the impression of a mustard plaster, covering the
nose and mouth; and then I scented mischief of a more serious kind.

“We had better carry her up to the seat,” I said, handing the lamp to
Miss Halliwell. “Then we can consider moving her to the house.” The
major and I lifted the helpless woman and, having climbed cautiously
up to the path, laid her on the seat.

“What is it, Dr. Jervis?” Miss Halliwell whispered.

“I can’t say at the moment,” I replied; “but it’s not what you
feared.”

“Thank God for that!” was her fervent rejoinder. “It would have been
a shocking scandal.”

I took the dim lamp and once more bent over the half-conscious woman.
Her appearance puzzled me not a little. She looked like a person
recovering from an anaesthetic, but the square red patch on her face,
recalling, as it did, the Burke murders, rather suggested
suffocation. As I was thus reflecting, the light of the lamp fell on
a white object lying on the ground behind the seat, and holding the
lamp forward, I saw that it was a square pad of cotton-wool. The
coincidence of its shape and size with that of the red patch on the
woman’s face instantly struck me, and I stooped down to pick it up;
and then I saw, lying under the seat, a small bottle. This also I
picked up and held in the lamplight. It was a one-ounce phial, quite
empty, and was labelled “Methylated Chloroform.” Here seemed to be a
complete explanation of the thick utterance and drunken aspect; but
it was an explanation that required, in its turn, to be explained.
Obviously no robbery had been committed, for the woman literally
glittered with diamonds. Equally obviously she had not administered
the chloroform to herself.

There was nothing for it but to carry her indoors and await her
further recovery, so, with the major’s help, we conveyed her through
the shrubbery and kitchen garden to a side door, and deposited her on
a sofa in a half-furnished room.

Here, under the influence of water dabbed on her face and the
plentiful use of smelling salts, she quickly revived, and was soon
able to give an intelligible account of herself.

The chloroform and cotton-wool were her own. She had used them for an
aching tooth; and she was sitting alone on the seat with the bottle
and the wool beside her when the incomprehensible thing had happened.
Without a moment’s warning a hand had come from behind her and
pressed the pad of wool over her nose and mouth. The wool was
saturated with chloroform, and she had lost consciousness almost
immediately.

“You didn’t see the person, then?” I asked.

“No, but I know he was in evening dress, because I felt my head
against his shirt-front.”

“Then,” said I, “he is either here still or he has been to the
cloak-room. He couldn’t have left the place without an overcoat.”

“No, by Jove!” exclaimed the major; “that’s true. I’ll go and make
inquiries.” He strode away all agog, and I, having satisfied myself
that Mrs. Chater could be left safely, followed him almost
immediately.

I made my way straight to the cloak-room, and here I found the major
and one or two of his brother officers putting on their coats in a
flutter of gleeful excitement.

“He’s gone,” said Podbury, struggling frantically into his overcoat;
“went off nearly an hour ago on a bicycle. Seemed in a deuce of a
stew, the attendant says, and no wonder. We’re goin’ after him in our
car. Care to join the hunt?”

“No, thanks. I must stay with the patient. But how do you know you’re
after the right man?”

“Isn’t any other. Only one Johnnie’s left. Besides--here, confound
it! you’ve given me the wrong coat!” He tore off the garment and
handed it back to the attendant, who regarded it with an expression
of dismay.

“Are you sure, sir?” he asked.

“Perfectly,” said the major. “Come, hurry up, my man.”

“I’m afraid, sir,” said the attendant, “that the gentleman who has
gone has taken your coat. They were on the same peg, I know. I am
very sorry, sir.”

The major was speechless with wrath. What the devil was the good of
being sorry; and how the deuce was he to get his coat back?

“But,” I interposed, “if the stranger has got your coat, then this
coat must be his.”

“I know,” said Podbury; “but I don’t want his beastly coat.”

“No,” I replied, “but it may be useful for identification.”

This appeared to afford the bereaved officer little consolation, but
as the car was now ready, he bustled away, and I, having directed the
man to put the coat away in a safe place, went back to my patient.

Mrs. Chater was by now fairly recovered, and had developed a highly
vindictive interest in her late assailant. She even went so far as to
regret that he had not taken at least some of her diamonds, so that
robbery might have been added to the charge of attempted murder, and
expressed the earnest hope that the officers would not be foolishly
gentle in their treatment of him when they caught him.

“By the way, Dr. Jervis,” said Miss Halliwell, “I think I ought to
mention a rather curious thing that happened in connection with this
dance. We received an acceptance from a Mr. Harrington-Baillie, who
wrote from the Hotel Cecil. Now I am certain that no such name was
proposed by any of the spinsters.”

“But didn’t you ask them?” I inquired.

“Well, the fact is,” she replied, “that one of them, Miss Waters, had
to go abroad suddenly, and we had not got her address; and as it was
possible that she might have invited him, I did not like to move in
the matter. I am very sorry I didn’t now. We may have let in a
regular criminal--though why he should have wanted to murder Mrs.
Chater I cannot imagine.”

It was certainly a mysterious affair, and the mystery was in no wise
dispelled by the return of the search party an hour later. It seemed
that the bicycle had been tracked for a couple of miles towards
London, but then, at the cross-roads, the tracks had become
hopelessly mixed with the impressions of other machines and the
officers, after cruising about vaguely for a while, had given up the
hunt and returned.

“You see, Mrs. Chater,” Major Podbury explained apologetically, “the
fellow must have had a good hour’s start, and that would have brought
him pretty close to London.”

“Do you mean to tell me,” exclaimed Mrs. Chater, regarding the major
with hardly-concealed contempt, “that that villain has got off
scot-free?”

“Looks rather like it,” replied Podbury, “but if I were you I should
get the man’s description from the attendants who saw him and go up
to Scotland Yard tomorrow. They may know the Johnny there, and they
may even recognize the coat if you take it with you.”

“That doesn’t seem very likely,” said Mrs. Chater, and it certainly
did not; but since no better plan could be suggested the lady decided
to adopt it; and I supposed that I had heard the last of the matter.

In this, however, I was mistaken. On the following day, just before
noon, as I was drowsily considering the points in a brief dealing
with a question of survivorship, while Thorndyke drafted his weekly
lecture, a smart rat-tat at the door of our chambers announced a
visitor. I rose wearily--I had had only four hours’ sleep--and opened
the door, whereupon there sailed into the room no less a person than
Mrs. Chater, followed by Superintendent Miller, with a grin on his
face and a brown-paper parcel under his arm.

The lady was not in the best of tempers, though wonderfully lively
and alert considering the severe shock that she had suffered so
recently, and her disapproval of Miller was frankly obvious.

“Dr. Jervis has probably told you about the attempt to murder me last
night,” she said, when I had introduced her to my colleague. “Well,
now, will you believe it? I have been to the police, I have given
them a description of the murderous villain, and I have even shown
them the very coat that he wore, and they tell me that nothing can be
done. That, in short, this scoundrel must be allowed to go his way
free and unmolested.”

“You will observe, doctor,” said Miller, “that this lady has given us
a description that would apply to fifty per cent. of the middle-class
men of the United Kingdom, and has shown us a coat without a single
identifying mark of any kind on it, and expects us to lay our hands
on the owner without a solitary clue to guide us. Now we are not
sorcerers at the Yard; we’re only policemen. So I have taken the
liberty of referring Mrs. Chater to you.” He grinned maliciously and
laid the parcel on the table.

“And what do you want me to do?” Thorndyke asked quietly.

“Why sir,” said Miller, “there is a coat. In the pockets were a pair
of gloves, a muffler, a box of matches, a tram-ticket and a Yale key.
Mrs. Chater would like to know whose coat it is.” He untied the
parcel with his eye cocked at our rather disconcerted client, and
Thorndyke watched him with a faint Smile.

“This is very kind of you, Miller,” said he, “but I think a
clairvoyant would be more to your purpose.”

The superintendent instantly dropped his facetious manner.

“Seriously, sir,” he said, “I should be glad if you would take a look
at the coat. We have absolutely nothing to go on, and yet we don’t
want to give up the case. I have gone through it most thoroughly and
can’t find any clue to guide us. Now I know that nothing escapes you,
and perhaps you might notice something that I have overlooked;
something that would give us a hint where to start on our inquiry.
Couldn’t you turn the microscope on it, for instance?” he added, with
a deprecating smile.

Thorndyke reflected, with an inquisitive eye on the coat. I saw that
the problem was not without its attractions to him; and when the lady
seconded Miller’s request with persuasive eagerness, the inevitable
consequence followed.

“Very well,” he said. “Leave the coat with me for an hour or so and I
will look it over. I am afraid there is not the remotest chance of
our learning anything from it, but even so, the examination will have
done no harm. Come back at two o’clock; I shall be ready to report my
failure by then.”

He bowed our visitors out and, returning to the table, looked down
with a quizzical smile on the coat and the large official envelope
containing articles from the pockets.

“And what does my learned brother suggest?” he asked, looking up at
me.

“I should look at the tram-ticket first,” I replied, “and then--well,
Miller’s suggestion wasn’t such a bad one; to explore the surface
with the microscope.”

“I think we will take the latter measure first,” said he. “The
tram-ticket might create a misleading bias. A man may take a tram
anywhere, whereas the indoor dust on a man’s coat appertains mostly
to a definite locality.”

“Yes,” I replied; “but the information that it yields is excessively
vague.”

“That is true,” he agreed, taking up the coat and envelope to carry
them to the laboratory, “and yet, you know, Jervis, as I have often
pointed out, the evidential value of dust is apt to be
under-estimated. The naked-eye appearances--which are the normal
appearances--are misleading. Gather the dust, say, from a table-top,
and what have you? A fine powder of a characterless grey, just like
any other dust from any other table-top. But, under the microscope,
this grey powder is resolved into recognizable fragments of definite
substances, which fragments may often be traced with certainty to the
masses from which they have been detached. But you know all this as
well as I do.”

“I quite appreciate the value of dust as evidence in certain
circumstances,” I replied, “but surely the information that could be
gathered from dust on the coat of an unknown man must be too general
to be of any use in tracing the owner.”

“I am afraid you are right,” said Thorndyke, laying the coat on the
laboratory bench; “but we shall soon see, if Polton will let us have
his patent dust-extractor.”

The little apparatus to which my colleague referred was the invention
of our ingenious laboratory assistant, and resembled in principle the
“vacuum cleaners” used for restoring carpets. It had, however, one
special feature: the receiver was made to admit a microscope-slide,
and on this the dust laden air was delivered from a jet.

The “extractor” having been clamped to the bench by its proud
inventor, and a wetted slide introduced into the receiver, Thorndyke
applied the nozzle of the instrument to the collar of the coat while
Polton worked the pump. The slide was then removed and, another
having been substituted, the nozzle was applied to the right sleeve
near the shoulder, and the exhauster again worked by Polton. By
repeating this process, half-a-dozen slides were obtained charged
with dust from different parts of the garment, and then, setting up
our respective microscopes, we proceeded to examine the samples.

A very brief inspection showed me that this dust contained matter not
usually met with--at any rate, in appreciable quantities. There were,
of course, the usual fragments of wool, cotton and other fibres
derived from clothing and furniture, particles of straw, husk, hair,
various mineral particles and, in fact, the ordinary constituents of
dust from clothing. But, in addition to these, and in much greater
quantity, were a number of other bodies, mostly of vegetable origin
and presenting well-defined characters in considerable variety, and
especially abundant were various starch granules.

I glanced at Thorndyke and observed he was already busy with a pencil
and a slip of paper, apparently making a list of the objects visible
in the field of the microscope. I hastened to follow his example, and
for a time we worked on in silence. At length my colleague leaned
back in his chair and read over his list.

“This is a highly interesting collection, Jervis,” he remarked. “What
do you find on your slides out of the ordinary?”

“I have quite a little museum here,” I replied, referring to my list.
“There is, of course, chalk from the road at Raynesford. In addition
to this I find various starches, principally wheat and rice,
especially rice, fragments of the cortices of several seeds, several
different stone-cells, some yellow masses that look like turmeric,
black pepper resin-cells, one ‘port wine’ pimento cell, and one or
two particles of graphite.”

“Graphite!” exclaimed Thorndyke. “I have found no graphite, but I
have found traces of cocoa--spiral vessels and starch grains--and of
hops--one fragment of leaf and several lupulin glands. May I see the
graphite?”

I passed him the slide and he examined it with keen interest. “Yes,”
he said, “this is undoubtedly graphite, and no less than six
particles of it. We had better go over the coat systematically. You
see the importance of this?”

“I see that this is evidently factory dust and that it may fix a
locality, but I don’t see that it will carry us any farther.”

“Don’t forget that we have a touchstone,” said he; and, as I raised
my eyebrows inquiringly, he added, “The Yale latch-key. If we can
narrow the locality down sufficiently, Miller can make a tour of the
front doors.”

“But can we?” I asked incredulously. “I doubt it.”

“We can try,” answered Thorndyke. “Evidently some of the substances
are distributed over the entire coat, inside and out, while others,
such as the graphite, are present only on certain parts. We must
locate those parts exactly and then consider what this special
distribution means.” He rapidly sketched out on a sheet of paper a
rough diagram of the coat, marking each part with a distinctive
letter, and then, taking a number of labelled slides, he wrote a
single letter on each. The samples of dust taken on the slides could
thus be easily referred to the exact spots whence they had been
obtained.

Once more we set to work with the microscope, making, now and again,
an addition to our lists of discoveries, and, at the end of nearly an
hour’s strenuous search, every slide had been examined and the lists
compared.

“The net result of the examination,” said Thorndyke, “is this. The
entire coat, inside and out, is evenly powdered with the following
substances: Rice-starch in abundance, wheat-starch in less abundance,
and smaller quantities of the starches of ginger, pimento and
cinnamon; bast fibre of cinnamon, various seed cortices, stone-cells
of pimento, cinnamon, cassia and black pepper, with other fragments
of similar origin, such as resin-cells and ginger pigment--not
turmeric. In addition there are, on the right shoulder and sleeve,
traces of cocoa and hops, and on the back below the shoulders a few
fragments of graphite. Those are the data; and now, what are the
inferences? Remember this is not mere surface dust, but the
accumulation of months, beaten into the cloth by repeated
brushing--dust that nothing but a vacuum apparatus could extract.”

“Evidently,” I said, “the particles that are all over the coat
represent dust that is floating in the air of the place where the
coat habitually hangs. The graphite has obviously been picked up from
a seat and the cocoa and hops from some factories that the man passes
frequently, though I don’t see why they are on the right side only.”

“That is a question of time,” said Thorndyke, “and incidentally
throws some light on our friend’s habits. Going from home, he passes
the factories on his right; returning home, he passes them on his
left, but they have then stopped work. However, the first group of
substances is the more important as they indicate the locality of his
dwelling--for he is clearly not a workman or factory employee. Now
rice-starch, wheat-starch and a group of substances collectively
designated ‘spices’ suggest a rice-mill, a flour-mill and a spice
factory. Polton, may I trouble you for the Post Office Directory?”

He turned over the leaves of the “Trades” section and resumed: “I see
there are four rice-mills in London, of which the largest is
Carbutt’s at Dockhead. Let us look at the spice-factories.” He again
turned over the leaves and read down the list of names. “There are
six spice-grinders in London,” said he. “One of them, Thomas Williams
& Co., is at Dockhead. None of the others is near any rice-mill. The
next question is as to the flour-mill. Let us see. Here are the names
of several flour millers, but none of them is near either a rice-mill
or a spice-grinder, with one exception: Seth Taylor’s, St. Saviour’s
Flour Mills, Dockhead.”

“This is really becoming interesting,” said I.

“It has become interesting,” Thorndyke retorted. “You observe that at
Dockhead we find the peculiar combination of factories necessary to
produce the composite dust in which this coat has hung; and the
directory shows us that this particular combination exists nowhere
else in London. Then the graphite, the cocoa and the hops tend to
confirm the other suggestions. They all appertain to industries of
the locality. The trams which pass Dockhead, also, to my knowledge,
pass at no great distance from the black-lead works of Pearce Duff &
Co. in Rouel Road, and will probably collect a few particles of
black-lead on the seats in certain states of the wind. I see, too,
that there is a cocoa factory--Payne’s--in Goat Street, Horsleydown,
which lies to the right of the tram line going west, and I have
noticed several hop warehouses on the right side of Southwark Street,
going west. But these are mere suggestions; the really important data
are the rice and flour mills and the spice-grinders, which seem to
point unmistakably to Dockhead.”

“Are there any private houses at Dockhead?” I asked.

“We must look up the ‘Street’ list,” he replied. “The Yale latch-key
rather suggests a flat, and a flat with a single occupant, and the
probable habits of our absent friend offer a similar suggestion.” He
ran his eye down the list and presently turned to me with his finger
on the page.

“If the facts that we have elicited--the singular series of
agreements with the required conditions--are only a string of
coincidences, here is another. On the south side of Dockhead,
actually next door to the spice-grinders and opposite to Carbutt’s
rice-mills, is a block of workmen’s flats, Hanover Buildings. They
fulfil the conditions exactly. A coat hung in a room in those flats,
with the windows open (as they would probably be at this time of
year), would be exposed to the air containing a composite dust of
precisely the character of that which we have found. Of course, the
same conditions obtain in other dwellings in this part of Dockhead,
but the probability is in favour of the buildings. And that is all
that we can say. It is no certainty. There may be some radical
fallacy in our reasoning. But, on the face of it, the chances are a
thousand to one that the door that that key will open is in some part
of Dockhead, and most probably in Hanover Buildings. We must leave
the verification to Miller.”

“Wouldn’t it be as well to look at the tram-ticket?” I asked.

“Dear me!” he exclaimed. “I had forgotten the ticket. Yes, by all
means.” He opened the envelope and, turning its contents out on the
bench, picked up the dingy slip of paper. After a glance at it he
handed it to me. It was punched for the journey from Tooley Street to
Dockhead.

“Another coincidence,” he remarked; “and by yet another, I think I
hear Miller knocking at our door.”

It was the superintendent, and, as we let him into the room, the hum
of a motor-car entering from Tudor Street announced the arrival of
Mrs. Chater. We waited for her at the open door, and, as she entered,
she held out her hands impulsively.

“Say, now, Dr. Thorndyke,” she exclaimed, “have you gotten something
to tell us?”

“I have a suggestion to make,” replied Thorndyke. “I think that if
the superintendent will take this key to Hanover Buildings, Dockhead,
Bermondsey, he may possibly find a door that it will fit.”

“The deuce!” exclaimed Miller. “I beg your pardon, madam; but I
thought I had gone through that coat pretty completely. What was it
that I had overlooked, sir? Was there a letter hidden in it, after
all?”

“You overlooked the dust on it, Miller; that is all,” said Thorndyke.

“Dust!” exclaimed the detective, staring round-eyed at my colleague.
Then he chuckled softly. “Well,” said he, “as I said before, I’m not
a sorcerer; I’m only a policeman.” He picked up the key and asked:
“Are you coming to see the end of it, sir?”

“Of course he is coming,” said Mrs. Chater, “and Dr. Jervis too, to
identify the man. Now that we have gotten the villain we must leave
him no loophole for escape.”

Thorndyke smiled dryly. “We will come if you wish it, Mrs. Chater,”
he said, “but you mustn’t look upon our quest as a certainty. We may
have made an entire miscalculation, and I am, in fact, rather curious
to see if the result works out correctly. But even if we run the man
to earth, I don’t see that you have much evidence against him. The
most that you can prove is that he was at the house and that he left
hurriedly.”

Mrs. Chater regarded my colleague for a moment in scornful silence,
and then, gathering up her skirts, stalked out of the room. If there
is one thing that the average woman detests more than another, it is
an entirely reasonable man.

The big car whirled us rapidly over Blackfriars Bridge into the
region of the Borough, whence we presently turned down Tooley Street
towards Bermondsey.

As soon as Dockhead came into view, the detective, Thorndyke and I,
alighted and proceeded on foot, leaving our client, who was now
closely veiled, to follow at a little distance in the car. Opposite
the head of St. Saviour’s Dock, Thorndyke halted and, looking over
the wall, drew my attention to the snowy powder that had lodged on
every projection on the backs of the tall buildings and on the decks
of the barges that were loading with the flour and ground rice. Then,
crossing the road, he pointed to the wooden lantern above the roof of
the spice works, the louvres of which were covered with greyish-buff
dust.

“Thus,” he moralized, “does commerce subserve the ends of justice--at
least, we hope it does,” he added quickly, as Miller disappeared into
the semi-basement of the buildings.

We met the detective returning from his quest as we entered the
building.

“No go there,” was his report. “We’ll try the next floor.”

This was the ground-floor, or it might be considered the first floor.
At any rate, it yielded nothing of interest, and, after a glance at
the doors that opened on the landing, he strode briskly up the stone
stairs. The next floor was equally unrewarding, for our eager
inspection disclosed nothing but the gaping keyhole associated with
the common type of night-latch.

“What name was you wanting?” inquired a dusty knight of industry who
emerged from one of the flats.

“Muggs,” replied Miller, with admirable promptness.

“Don’t know ’im,” said the workman. “I expect it’s farther up.”

Farther up we accordingly went, but still from each door the artless
grin of the invariable keyhole saluted us with depressing monotony. I
began to grow uneasy, and when the fourth floor had been explored
with no better result, my anxiety became acute. A mare’s nest may be
an interesting curiosity, but it brings no kudos to its discoverer.

“I suppose you haven’t made any mistake, sir?” said Miller, stopping
to wipe his brow.

“It’s quite likely that I have,” replied Thorndyke, with unmoved
composure. “I only proposed this search as a tentative proceeding,
you know.”

The superintendent grunted. He was accustomed--as was I too, for that
matter--to regard Thorndyke’s “tentative suggestions” as equal to
another man’s certainties.

“It will be an awful suck-in for Mrs. Chater if we don’t find him
after all,” he growled as we climbed up the last flight. “She’s
counted her chickens to a feather.” He paused at the head of the
stairs and stood for a few moments looking round the landing.
Suddenly he turned eagerly, and, laying his hand on Thorndyke’s arm,
pointed to a door in the farthest corner.

“Yale lock!” he whispered impressively.

We followed him silently as he stole on tip-toe across the landing,
and watched him as he stood for an instant with the key in his land
looking gloatingly at the brass disc. We saw him softly apply the
nose of the fluted key-blade to the crooked slit in the cylinder,
and, as we watched, it slid noiselessly up to the shoulder. The
detective looked round with a grin of triumph, and, silently
withdrawing the key, stepped back to us.

“You’ve run him to earth, sir,” he whispered, “but I don’t think Mr.
Fox is at home. He can’t have got back yet.”

“Why not?” asked Thorndyke.

Miller waved his hand towards the door. “Nothing has been disturbed,”
he replied. “There’s not a mark on the paint. Now he hadn’t got the
key, and you can’t pick a Yale lock. He’d have had to break in, and
he hasn’t broken in.”

Thorndyke stepped up to the door and softly pushed in the flap of the
letter-slit, through which he looked into the flat.

“There’s no letter-box,” said he. “My dear Miller, I would undertake
to open that door in five minutes with a foot of wire and a bit of
resined string.”

Miller shook his head and grinned once more. “I am glad you’re not on
the lay, sir; you’d be one too many for us. Shall we signal to the
lady?”

I went out onto the gallery and looked down at the waiting car. Mrs.
Chater was staring intently up at the building, and the little crowd
that the car had collected stared alternately at the lady and at the
object of her regard. I wiped my face with my handkerchief--the
signal agreed upon--and she instantly sprang out of the car, and in
an incredibly short time she appeared on the landing, purple and
gasping, but with the fire of battle flashing from her eyes.

“We’ve found his flat, madam,” said Miller, “and we’re going to
enter. You’re not intending to offer any violence, I hope,” he added,
noting with some uneasiness the lady’s ferocious expression.

“Of course I’m not,” replied Mrs. Chater. “In the States ladies don’t
have to avenge insults themselves. If you were American men you’d
hang the ruffian from his own bedpost.”

“We’re not American men, madam,” said the superintendent stiffly. “We
are law-abiding Englishmen, and, moreover, we are all officers of the
law. These gentlemen are barristers and I am a police officer.”

With this preliminary caution, he once more inserted the key, and as
he turned it and pushed the door open, we all followed him into the
sitting-room.

“I told you so, sir,” said Miller, softly shutting the door; “he
hasn’t come back yet.”

Apparently he was right. At any rate, there was no one in the flat,
and we proceeded unopposed on our tour of inspection. It was a
miserable spectacle, and, as we wandered from one squalid room to
another, a feeling of pity for the starving wretch into whose lair we
were intruding stole over me and began almost to mitigate the
hideousness of his crime. On all sides poverty--utter, grinding
poverty--stared us in the face. It looked at us hollow-eyed in the
wretched sitting-room, with its bare floor, its solitary chair and
tiny deal table; its unfurnished walls and windows destitute of blind
or curtain. A piece of Dutch cheese-rind on the table, scraped to the
thinness of paper, whispered of starvation; and famine lurked in the
gaping cupboard, in the empty bread-tin, in the tea-caddy with its
pinch of dust at the bottom, in the jam-jar, wiped clean, as a few
crumbs testified, with a crust of bread. There was not enough food in
the place to furnish a meal for a healthy mouse.

The bedroom told the same tale, but with a curious variation. A
miserable truckle-bed with a straw mattress and a cheap jute rug for
bed-clothes, an orange-case, stood on end, for a dressing-table, and
another, bearing a tin washing bowl, formed the wretched furniture.
But the suit that hung from a couple of nails was well-cut and even
fashionable, though shabby; and another suit lay on the floor, neatly
folded and covered with a newspaper; and, most incongruous of all, a
silver cigarette-case reposed on the dressing-table.

“Why on earth does this fellow starve,” I exclaimed, “when he has a
silver case to pawn?”

“Wouldn’t do,” said Miller. “A man doesn’t pawn the implements of his
trade.”

Mrs. Chater, who had been staring about her with the mute amazement
of a wealthy woman confronted, for the first time, with abject
poverty, turned suddenly to the superintendent. “This can’t be the
man!” she exclaimed. “You have made some mistake. This poor creature
could never have made his way into a house like Willowdale.”

Thorndyke lifted the newspaper. Beneath it was a dress suit with the
shirt, collar and tie all carefully smoothed out and folded.
Thorndyke unfolded the shirt and pointed to the curiously crumpled
front. Suddenly he brought it close to his eye and then, from the
sham diamond stud, he drew a single hair--a woman’s hair.

“That is rather significant,” said he, holding it up between his
finger and thumb; and Mrs. Chater evidently thought so too, for the
pity and compunction suddenly faded from her face, and once more her
eyes flashed with vindictive fire.

“I wish he would come,” she exclaimed viciously. “Prison won’t be
much hardship to him after this, but I want to see him in the dock
all the same.”

“No,” the detective agreed, “it won’t hurt him much to swap this for
Portland. Listen!”

A key was being inserted into the outer door, and as we all stood
like statues, a man entered and closed the door after him. He passed
the door of the bedroom without seeing us, and with the dragging
steps of a weary, dispirited man. Almost immediately we heard him go
to the kitchen and draw water into some vessel. Then he went back to
the sitting-room.

“Come along,” said Miller, stepping silently towards the door. We
followed closely, and as he threw the door open, we looked in over
his shoulder.

The man had seated himself at the table, on which now lay a hunk of
household bread resting on the paper in which he had brought it, and
a tumbler of water. He half rose as the door opened, and as if
petrified remained staring at Miller with a dreadful expression of
terror upon his livid face.

At this moment I felt a hand on my arm, and Mrs. Chater brusquely
pushed past me into the room. But at the threshold she stopped short;
and a singular change crept over the man’s ghastly face, a change so
remarkable that I looked involuntarily from him to our client. She
had turned, in a moment, deadly pale, and her face had frozen into an
expression of incredulous horror.

The dramatic silence was broken by the matter-of-fact voice of the
detective.

“I am a police officer,” said he, “and I arrest you for----”

A peal of hysterical laughter from Mrs. Chater interrupted him, and
he looked at her in astonishment. “Stop, stop!” she cried in a shaky
voice. “I guess we’ve made a ridiculous mistake. This isn’t the man.
This gentleman is Captain Rowland, an old friend of mine.”

“I’m sorry he’s a friend of yours,” said Miller, “because I shall
have to ask you to appear against him.”

“You can ask what you please,” replied Mrs. Chater. “I tell you he’s
not the man.”

The superintendent rubbed his nose and looked hungrily at his quarry.
“Do I understand, madam,” he asked stiffly, “that you refuse to
prosecute?”

“Prosecute!” she exclaimed. “Prosecute my friends for offences that I
know they have not committed? Certainly I refuse.”

The superintendent looked at Thorndyke, but my colleague’s
countenance had congealed into a state of absolute immobility and was
as devoid of expression as the face of a Dutch clock.

“Very well,” said Miller, looking sourly at his watch. “Then we have
had our trouble for nothing. I wish you good afternoon, madam.”

“I am sorry I troubled you, now,” said Mrs. Chater.

“I am sorry you did,” was the curt reply; and the superintendent,
flinging the key on the table, stalked out of the room.

As the outer door slammed the man sat down with an air of
bewilderment; and then, suddenly flinging his arms on the table, he
dropped his head on them and burst into a passion of sobbing.

It was very embarrassing. With one accord Thorndyke and I turned to
go, but Mrs. Chater motioned us to stay. Stepping over to the man,
she touched him lightly on the arm.

“Why did you do it?” she asked in a tone of gentle reproach.

The man sat up and flung out one arm in an eloquent gesture that
comprehended the miserable room and the yawning cupboard.

“It was the temptation of a moment,” he said. “I was penniless, and
those accursed diamonds were thrust in my face; they were mine for
the taking. I was mad, I suppose.”

“But why didn’t you take them?” she said. “Why didn’t you?”

“I don’t know. The madness passed; and then--when I saw you lying
there---- Oh, God! Why don’t you give me up to the police?” He laid
his head down and sobbed afresh.

Mrs. Chater bent over him with tears standing in her pretty grey
eyes. “But tell me,” she said, “why didn’t you take the diamonds? You
could if you’d liked, I suppose?”

“What good were they to me?” he demanded passionately. “What did any
thing matter to me? I thought you were dead.”

“Well, I’m not, you see,” she said, with a rather tearful smile; “I’m
just as well as an old woman like me can expect to be. And I want
your address, so that I can write and give you some good advice.”

The man sat up and produced a shabby cardcase from his pocket, and,
as he took out a number of cards and spread them out like the “hand”
of a whist player, I caught a twinkle in Thorndyke’s eye.

“My name is Augustus Bailey,” said the man. He selected the
appropriate card, and, having scribbled his address on it with a
stump of lead pencil, relapsed into his former position.

“Thank you,” said Mrs. Chater, lingering for a moment by the table.
“Now we’ll go. Good-bye, Mr. Bailey. I shall write tomorrow, and you
must attend seriously to the advice of an old friend.”

I held open the door for her to pass out and looked back before I
turned to follow. Bailey still sat sobbing quietly, with his hand
resting on his arms; and a little pile of gold stood on the corner of
the table.

“I expect, doctor,” said Mrs. Chater, as Thorndyke handed her into
the car, “you’ve written me down a sentimental fool.”

Thorndyke looked at her with an unwonted softening of his rather
severe face and answered quietly, “It is written: Blessed are the
Merciful.”




THE OLD LAG


PART I

THE CHANGED IMMUTABLE

Among the minor and purely physical pleasures of life, I am disposed
to rank very highly that feeling of bodily comfort that one
experiences on passing from the outer darkness of a wet winter’s
night to a cheerful interior made glad by mellow lamplight and
blazing hearth. And so I thought when, on a dreary November night, I
let myself into our chambers in the Temple and found my friend
smoking his pipe in slippered ease, by a roaring fire, and facing an
empty armchair evidently placed in readiness for me.

As I shed my damp overcoat, I glanced inquisitively at my colleague,
for he held in his hand an open letter, and I seemed to perceive in
his aspect something meditative and self-communing--something, in
short, suggestive of a new case.

“I was just considering,” he said, in answer to my inquiring look,
“whether I am about to become an accessory after the fact. Read that
and give me your opinion.”

He handed me the letter, which I read aloud.



“DEAR SIR,--I am in great danger and distress. A warrant has been
issued for my arrest on a charge of which I am entirely innocent. Can
I come and see you, and will you let me leave in safety? The bearer
will wait for a reply.”



“I said ‘Yes,’ of course; there was nothing else to do,” said
Thorndyke. “But if I let him go, as I have promised to do, I shall be
virtually conniving at his escape.”

“Yes, you are taking a risk,” I answered. “When is he coming?”

“He was due five minutes ago--and I rather think--yes, here he is.”

A stealthy tread on the landing was followed by a soft tapping on the
outer door.

Thorndyke rose and, flinging open the inner door, unfastened the
massive “oak.”

“Dr. Thorndyke?” inquired a breathless, quavering voice.

“Yes, come in. You sent me a letter by hand?”

“I did, sir,” was the reply; and the speaker entered, but at the
sight of me he stopped short.

“This is my colleague, Dr. Jervis,” Thorndyke explained. “You need
have no----”

“Oh, I remember him,” our visitor interrupted in a tone of relief. “I
have seen you both before, you know, and you have seen me too--though
I don’t suppose you recognize me,” he added, with a sickly smile.

“Frank Belfield?” asked Thorndyke, smiling also.

Our visitor’s jaw fell and he gazed at my colleague in sudden dismay.

“And I may remark,” pursued Thorndyke, “that for a man in your
perilous position, you are running most unnecessary risks. That wig,
that false beard and those spectacles--through which you obviously
cannot see--are enough to bring the entire police force at your
heels. It is not wise for a man who is wanted by the police to make
up as though he had just escaped from a comic opera.”

Mr. Belfield seated himself with a groan, and, taking off his
spectacles, stared stupidly from one of us to the other.

“And now tell us about your little affair,” said Thorndyke. “You say
that you are innocent?”

“I swear it, doctor,” replied Belfield; adding, with great
earnestness, “And you may take it from me, sir, that if I was not, I
shouldn’t be here. It was you that convicted me last time, when I
thought myself quite safe, so I know your ways too well to try to
gammon you.”

“If you are innocent,” rejoined Thorndyke, “I will do what I can for
you; and if you are not--well, you would have been wiser to stay
away.”

“I know that well enough,” said Belfield, “and I am only afraid that
you won’t believe what I am going to tell you.”

“I shall keep an open mind, at any rate,” replied Thorndyke.

“If you only will,” groaned Belfield, “I shall have a look in, in
spite of them all. You know, sir, that I have been on the crook, but
I have paid in full. That job when you tripped me up was the last of
it--it was, sir, so help me. It was a woman that changed me--the best
and truest woman on God’s earth. She said she would marry me when I
came out if I promised her to go straight and live an honest life.
And she kept her promise--and I have kept mine. She found me work as
clerk in a warehouse and I have stuck to it ever since, earning fair
wages and building up a good character as an honest, industrious man.
I thought all was going well and that I was settled for life, when
only this very morning the whole thing comes tumbling about my ears
like a house of cards.”

“What happened this morning, then?” asked Thorndyke.

“Why, I was on my way to work when, as I passed the police station, I
noticed a bill with the heading ‘Wanted’ and a photograph. I stopped
for a moment to look at it, and you may imagine my feelings when I
recognized my own portrait--taken at Holloway--and read my own name
and description. I did not stop to read the bill through, but ran
back home and told my wife, and she ran down to the station and read
the bill carefully. Good God, sir! What do you think I am wanted
for?” He paused for a moment, and then re plied in breathless tones
to his own question: “The Camberwell murder!”

Thorndyke gave a low whistle.

“My wife knows I didn’t do it,” continued Belfield, “because I was at
home all the evening and night; but what use is a man’s wife to prove
an alibi?”

“Not much, I fear,” Thorndyke admitted; “and you have no other
witness?”

“Not a soul. We were alone all the evening.”

“However,” said Thorndyke, “if you are innocent--as I am
assuming--the evidence against you must be entirely circumstantial
and your alibi may be quite sufficient. Have you any idea of the
grounds of suspicion against you?”

“Not the faintest. The papers said that the police had an excellent
clue, but they did not say what it was. Probably some one has given
false information for the----”

A sharp rapping at the outer door cut short the explanation, and our
visitor rose, trembling and aghast, with beads of sweat standing upon
his livid face.

“You had better go into the office, Belfield, while we see who it
is,” said Thorndyke. “The key is on the inside.”

The fugitive wanted no second bidding, but hurried into the empty
apartment, and, as the door closed, we heard the key turn in the lock.

As Thorndyke threw open the outer door, he cast a meaning glance at
me over his shoulder which I understood when the newcomer entered the
room; for it was none other than Superintendent Miller of Scotland
Yard.

“I have just dropped in,” said the superintendent, in his brisk,
cheerful way, “to ask you to do me a favour. Good evening, Dr.
Jervis. I hear you are reading for the bar; learned counsel soon,
sir, hey? Medico-legal expert. Dr. Thorndyke’s mantle going to fall
on you, sir?”

“I hope Dr. Thorndyke’s mantle will continue to drape his own
majestic form for many a long year yet,” I answered; “though he is
good enough to spare me a corner--but what on earth have you got
there?” For during this dialogue the Superintendent had been deftly
unfastening a brown-paper parcel, from which he now drew a linen
shirt, once white, but now of an unsavoury grey.

“I want to know what this is,” said Miller, exhibiting a brownish-red
stain on one sleeve. “Just look at that, sir, and tell me if it is
blood, and, if so, is it human blood?”

“Really, Miller,” said Thorndyke, with a smile, “you flatter me; but
I am not like the wise woman of Bagdad who could tell you how many
stairs the patient had tumbled down by merely looking at his tongue.
I must examine this very thoroughly. When do you want to know?”

“I should like to know to-night,” replied the detective.

“Can I cut a piece out to put under the microscope?”

“I would rather you did not,” was the reply.

“Very well; you shall have the information in about an hour.”

“It’s very good of you, doctor,” said the detective; and he was
taking up his hat preparatory to departing, when Thorndyke said
suddenly----

“By the way, there is a little matter that I was going to speak to
you about. It refers to this Camberwell murder case. I understand you
have a clue to the identity of the murderer?”

“Clue!” exclaimed the superintendent contemptuously. “We have spotted
our man all right, if we could only lay hands on him; but he has
given us the slip for the moment.”

“Who is the man?” asked Thorndyke.

The detective looked doubtfully at Thorndyke for some seconds and
then said, with evident reluctance: “I suppose there is no harm in
telling you--especially as you probably know already”--this with a
sly grin; “it’s an old crook named Belfield.”

“And what is the evidence against him?”

Again the superintendent looked doubtful and again relented.

“Why, the case is as clear as--as cold Scotch,” he said (here
Thorndyke in illustration of this figure of speech produced a
decanter, a syphon and a tumbler, which he pushed towards the
officer). “You see, sir, the silly fool went and stuck his sweaty
hand on the window; and there we found the marks--four fingers and a
thumb, as beautiful prints as you could wish to see. Of course we cut
out the piece of glass and took it up to the Finger-print Department;
they turned up their files and out came Mr. Belfield’s record, with
his finger-prints and photograph all complete.”

“And the finger-prints on the window-pane were identical with those
on the prison form?”

“Identical.”

“H’m!” Thorndyke reflected for a while, and the superintendent
watched him foxily over the edge of his tumbler.

“I guess you are retained to defend Belfield,” the latter observed
presently.

“To look into the case generally,” replied Thorndyke.

“And I expect you know where the beggar is hiding,” continued the
detective.

“Belfield’s address has not yet been communicated to me,” said
Thorndyke. “I am merely to investigate the case--and there is no
reason, Miller, why you and I should be at cross purposes. We are
both working at the case; you want to get a conviction and you want
to convict the right man.”

“That’s so--and Belfield’s the right man--but what do you want of us,
doctor?”

“I should like to see the piece of glass with the finger-prints on
it, and the prison form, and take a photograph of each. And I should
like to examine the room in which the murder took place--you have it
locked up, I suppose?”

“Yes, we have the keys. Well, it’s all rather irregular, letting you
see the things. Still, you’ve always played the game fairly with us,
so we might stretch a point. Yes, I will. I’ll come back in an hour
for your report and bring the glass and the form. I can’t let them go
out of my custody, you know. I’ll be off now--no, thank you, not
another drop.”

The superintendent caught up his hat and strode away, the
personification of mental alertness and bodily vigour.

No sooner had the door closed behind him than Thorndyke’s stolid calm
changed instantaneously into feverish energy. Darting to the electric
bell that rang into the laboratories above, he pressed the button
while he gave me my directions.

“Have a look at that bloodstain, Jervis, while I am finishing with
Belfield. Don’t wet it; scrape it into a drop of warm normal saline
solution.”

I hastened to reach down the microscope and set out on the table the
necessary apparatus and reagents, and, as I was thus occupied, a
latch-key turned in the outer door and our invaluable helpmate,
Polton, entered the room in his habitual silent, unobtrusive fashion.

“Let me have the finger-print apparatus, please, Polton,” said
Thorndyke; “and have the copying camera ready by nine o’clock. I am
expecting Mr. Miller with some documents.”

As his laboratory assistant departed, Thorndyke rapped at the office
door.

“It’s all clear, Belfield,” he called; “you can come out.”

The key turned and the prisoner emerged, looking ludicrously
woebegone in his ridiculous wig and beard.

“I am going to take your finger-prints, to compare with some that the
police found on the window.”

“Finger-prints!” exclaimed Belfield, in a tone of dismay. “They don’t
say they’re my finger-prints, do they, sir?”

“They do indeed,” replied Thorndyke, eyeing the man narrowly. “They
have compared them with those taken when you were at Holloway, and
they say that they are identical.”

“Good God!” murmured Belfield, collapsing into a chair, faint and
trembling. “They must have made some awful mistake. But are mistakes
possible with finger-prints?”

“Now look here, Belfield,” said Thorndyke. “Were you in that house
that night, or were you not? It is of no use for you to tell me any
lies.”

“I was not there, sir; I swear to God I was not.”

“Then they cannot be your finger-prints, that is obvious.” Here he
stepped to the door to intercept Polton, from whom he received a
substantial box, which he brought in and placed on the table.

“Tell me all you know about this case,” he continued, as he set out
the contents of the box on the table.

“I know nothing about it whatever,” replied Belfield; “nothing, at
least, except----”

“Except what?” demanded Thorndyke, looking up sharply as he squeezed
a drop from a tube of finger-print ink onto a smooth copper plate.

“Except that the murdered man, Caldwell, was a retired fence.”

“A fence, was he?” said Thorndyke in a tone of interest.

“Yes; and I suspect he was a ‘nark’ too. He knew more than was
wholesome for a good many.”

“Did he know anything about you?”

“Yes; but nothing that the police don’t know.”

With a small roller Thorndyke spread the ink upon the plate into a
thin film. Then he laid on the edge of the table a smooth white card
and, taking Belfield’s right hand, pressed the forefinger firmly but
quickly, first on the inked plate and then on the card, leaving on
the latter a clear print of the finger-tip. This process he repeated
with the other fingers and thumb, and then took several additional
prints of each.

“That was a nasty injury to your forefinger, Belfield,” said
Thorndyke, holding the finger to the light and examining the tip
carefully. “How did you do it?”

“Stuck a tin-opener into it--a dirty one, too. It was bad for weeks;
in fact, Dr. Sampson thought at one time that he would have to
amputate the finger.”

“How long ago was that?”

“Oh, nearly a year ago, sir.”

Thorndyke wrote the date of the injury by the side of the
finger-print and then, having rolled up the inking plate afresh, laid
on the table several larger cards.

“I am now going to take the prints of the four fingers and the thumb
all at once,” he said.

“They only took the four fingers at once at the prison,” said
Belfield. “They took the thumb separately.”

“I know,” replied Thorndyke; “but I am going to take the impression
just as it would appear on the window glass.”

He took several impressions thus, and then, having looked at his
watch, he began to repack the apparatus in its box. While doing this,
he glanced, from time to time, in meditative fashion, at the
suspected man who sat, the living picture of misery and terror,
wiping the greasy ink from his trembling fingers with his
handkerchief.

“Belfield,” he said at length, “you have sworn to me that you are an
innocent man and are trying to live an honest life. I believe you;
but in a few minutes I shall know for certain.”

“Thank God for that, sir,” exclaimed Belfield, brightening up
wonderfully.

“And now,” said Thorndyke, “you had better go back into the office,
for I am expecting Superintendent Miller, and he may be here at any
moment.”

Belfield hastily slunk back into the office, locking the door after
him, and Thorndyke, having returned the box to the laboratory and
deposited the cards bearing the finger-prints in a drawer, came round
to inspect my work. I had managed to detach a tiny fragment of dried
clot from the bloodstained garment, and this, in a drop of normal
saline solution, I now had under the microscope.

“What do you make out, Jervis?” my colleague asked.

“Oval corpuscles with distinct nuclei,” I answered.

“Ah,” said Thorndyke, “that will be good hearing for some poor devil.
Have you measured them?”

“Yes. Long diameter 1/2100 of an inch; short diameter about 1/3400.”

Thorndyke reached down an indexed note-book from a shelf of reference
volumes and consulted a table of histological measurements.

“That would seem to be the blood of a pheasant, then, or it might,
more probably, be that of a common fowl.” He applied his eye to the
microscope and, fitting in the eye-piece micrometer, verified my
measurements. He was thus employed when a sharp tap was heard on the
outer door, and rising to open it he admitted the superintendent.

“I see you are at work on my little problem, doctor,” said the
latter, glancing at the microscope. “What do you make of that stain?”

“It is the blood of a bird--probably a pheasant, or perhaps a common
fowl.”

The superintendent slapped his thigh. “Well, I’m hanged!” he
exclaimed. “You’re a regular wizard, doctor, that’s what you are. The
fellow said he got that stain through handling a wounded pheasant and
here are you able to tell us yes or no without a hint from us to help
you. Well, you’ve done my little job for me, sir, and I’m much
obliged to you; now I’ll carry out my part of the bargain.” He opened
a handbag and drew forth a wooden frame and a blue foolscap envelope
and laid them with extreme care on the table.

“There you are, sir,” said he, pointing to the frame; “you will find
Mr. Belfield’s trademark very neatly executed, and in the envelope is
the finger-print sheet for comparison.”

Thorndyke took up the frame and examined it. It enclosed two sheets
of glass, one being the portion of the window-pane and the other a
cover-glass to protect the finger prints. Laying a sheet of white
paper on the table, where the light was strongest, Thorndyke held the
frame over it and gazed at the glass in silence, but with that faint
lighting up of his impassive face which I knew so well and which
meant so much to me. I walked round, and looking over his shoulder
saw upon the glass the beautifully distinct imprints of four fingers
and a thumb--the finger-tips, in fact, of an open hand.

After regarding the frame attentively for some time, Thorndyke
produced from his pocket a little wash-leather bag, from which he
extracted a powerful doublet lens, and with the aid of this he again
explored the finger-prints, dwelling especially upon the print of the
forefinger.

“I don’t think you will find much amiss with those finger-prints,
doctor,” said the superintendent, “they are as clear as if he made
them on purpose.”

“They are indeed,” replied Thorndyke, with an inscrutable smile,
“exactly as if he had made them on purpose. And how beautifully clean
the glass is--as if he had polished it before making the impression.”

The superintendent glanced at Thorndyke with quick suspicion; but the
smile had faded and given place to a wooden immobility from which
nothing could be gleaned.

When he had examined the glass exhaustively, Thorndyke drew the
finger-print form from its envelope and scanned it quickly, glancing
repeatedly from the paper to the glass and from the glass to the
paper. At length he laid them both on the table, and turning to the
detective looked him steadily in the face.

“I think, Miller,” said he, “that I can give you a hint.”

“Indeed, sir? And what might that be?”

“It is this: you are after the wrong man.”

The Superintendent snorted--not a loud snort, for that would have
been rude, and no officer could be more polite than Superintendent
Miller. But it conveyed a protest which he speedily followed up in
words.

“You don’t mean to say that the prints on that glass are not the
finger-prints of Frank Belfield?”

“I say that those prints were not made by Frank Belfield,” Thorndyke
replied firmly.

“Do you admit, sir, that the finger-prints on the official form were
made by him?”

“I have no doubt that they were.”

“Well, sir, Mr. Singleton, of the Finger-print Department, has
compared the prints on the glass with those on the form and he says
they are identical; and I have examined them and I say they are
identical.”

“Exactly,” said Thorndyke; “and I have examined them and I say they
are identical--and that therefore those on the glass cannot have been
made by Belfield.”

The Superintendent Snorted again--somewhat louder this time--and
gazed at Thorndyke with wrinkled brows.

“You are not pulling my leg, I suppose, sir?” he asked, a little
sourly.

“I should as soon think of tickling a porcupine,” Thorndyke answered,
with a suave smile.

“Well,” rejoined the bewildered detective, “if I didn’t know you,
sir, I should say you were talking confounded nonsense. Perhaps you
wouldn’t mind explaining what you mean.”

“Supposing,” said Thorndyke, “I make it clear to you that those
prints on the window-pane were not made by Belfield. Would you still
execute the warrant?”

“What do _you_ think?” exclaimed Miller. “Do you suppose we should go
into court to have you come and knock the bottom out of our case,
like you did in that Hornby affair--by the way, that was a
finger-print case too, now I come to think of it,” and the
superintendent suddenly became thoughtful.

“You have often complained,” pursued Thorndyke, “that I have withheld
information from you and sprung unexpected evidence on you at the
trial. Now I am going to take you into my confidence, and when I have
proved to you that this clue of yours is a false one, I shall expect
you to let this poor devil Belfield go his way in peace.”

The superintendent grunted--a form of utterance that committed him to
nothing.

“These prints,” continued Thorndyke, taking up the frame once more,
“present several features of interest, one of which, at least, ought
not to have escaped you and Mr. Singleton, as it seems to have done.
Just look at that thumb.”

The superintendent did so, and then pored over the official paper.

“Well,” he said, “I don’t see anything the matter with it. It’s
exactly like the print on the paper.”

“Of course it is,” rejoined Thorndyke, “and that is just the point.
It ought not to be. The print of the thumb on the paper was taken
separately from the fingers. And why? Because it was impossible to
take it at the same time. The thumb is in a different plane from the
fingers; when the hand is laid flat on any surface--as this
window-pane, for instance--the palmar surfaces of the fingers touch
it, whereas it is the _side_ of the thumb which comes in contact and
not the palmar surface. But in this”--he tapped the framed glass with
his finger--“the prints show the palmar surfaces of all the five
digits in contact at once, which is an impossibility. Just try to put
your own thumb in that position and you will see that it is so.”

The detective spread out his hand on the table and immediately
perceived the truth of my colleague’s statement.

“And what does that prove?” he asked.

“It proves that the thumb-print on the window-pane was not made at
the same time as the finger-prints--that it was added separately; and
that fact seems to prove that the prints were not made accidentally,
but--as you ingeniously suggested just now--were put there for a
purpose.”

“I don’t quite see the drift of all this,” said the superintendent,
rubbing the back of his head perplexedly; “and you said a while back
that the prints on the glass can’t be Belfield’s because they are
identical with the prints on the form. Now that seems to me sheer
nonsense, if you will excuse my saying so.”

“And yet,” replied Thorndyke, “it is the actual fact. Listen: these
prints”--here he took up the official sheet--“were taken at Holloway
six years ago. These”--pointing to the framed glass--“were made
within the present week. The one is, as regards the ridge-pattern, a
perfect duplicate of the other. Is that not so?”

“That is so, doctor,” agreed the superintendent.

“Very well. Now suppose I were to tell you that within the last
twelve months something had happened to Belfield that made an
appreciable change in the ridge-pattern on one of his fingers?”

“But is such a thing possible?”

“It is not only possible but it has happened. I will show you.”

He brought forth from the drawer the cards on which Belfield had made
his finger-prints, and laid them before the detective.

“Observe the prints of the forefinger,” he said, indicating them;
“there are a dozen, in all, and you will notice in each a white line
crossing the ridges and dividing them. That line is caused by a scar,
which has destroyed a portion of the ridges, and is now an integral
part of Belfield’s finger-print. And since no such blank line is to
be seen in this print on the glass--in which the ridges appear
perfect, as they were before the injury--it follows that that print
could not have been made by Belfield’s finger.”

“There is no doubt about the injury, I suppose?”

“None whatever. There is the scar to prove it, and I can produce the
surgeon who attended Belfield at the time.”

The officer rubbed his head harder than before, and regarded
Thorndyke with puckered brows.

“This is a teaser,” he growled, “it is indeed. What you say, sir,
seems perfectly sound, and yet--there are those finger-prints on the
window-glass. Now you can’t get finger prints without fingers, can
you?”

“Undoubtedly you can,” said Thorndyke.

“I should want to see that done before I could believe even you,
sir,” said Miller.

“You shall see it done now,” was the calm rejoinder. “You have
evidently forgotten the Hornby case--the case of the Red Thumb-mark,
as the newspapers called it.”

“I only heard part of it,” replied Miller, “and I didn’t really
follow the evidence in that.”

“Well, I will show you a relic of that case,” said Thorndyke. He
unlocked a cabinet and took from one of the shelves a small box
labelled “Hornby,” which, being opened, was seen to contain a folded
paper, a little red-covered oblong book and what looked like a large
boxwood pawn.

“This little book,” Thorndyke continued, “is a ‘thumbograph’--a sort
of finger-print album--I dare say you know the kind of thing.”

The superintendent nodded contemptuously at the little volume.

“Now while Dr. Jervis is finding us the print we want, I will run up
to the laboratory for an inked slab.”

He handed me the little book and, as he left the room, I began to
turn over the leaves--not without emotion, for it was this very
“thumbograph” that first introduced me to my wife, as is related
elsewhere--glancing at the various prints above the familiar names
and marvelling afresh at the endless variations of pattern that they
displayed. At length I came upon two thumb-prints of which one--the
left--was marked by a longitudinal white line--evidently the trace of
a scar; and underneath them was written the signature “Reuben Hornby.”

At this moment Thorndyke re-entered the room carrying the inked slab,
which he laid on the table, and seating him self between the
superintendent and me, addressed the former.

“Now, Miller, here are two thumb-prints made by a gentleman named
Reuben Hornby. Just glance at the left one; it is a highly
characteristic print.”

“Yes,” agreed Miller, “one could swear to that from memory, I should
think.”

“Then look at this.” Thorndyke took the paper from the box and,
unfolding it, handed it to the detective. It bore a pencilled
inscription, and on it were two blood-smears and a very distinct
thumb-print in blood. “What do you say to that thumb-print?”

“Why,” answered Miller, “it’s this one, of course; Reuben Hornby’s
left thumb.”

“Wrong, my friend,” said Thorndyke. “It was made by an ingenious
gentleman named Walter Hornby (whom you followed from the Old Bailey
and lost on Ludgate Hill); but not with his thumb.”

“How, then?” demanded the superintendent incredulously.

“In this way.” Thorndyke took the boxwood “pawn” from its receptacle
and pressed its flat base onto the inked slab; then lifted it and
pressed it onto the back of a visiting-card, and again raised it; and
now the card was marked by a very distinct thumb-print.

“My God!” exclaimed the detective, picking up the card and viewing it
with a stare of dismay, “this is the very devil, sir. This fairly
knocks the bottom out of finger-print identification. May I ask, sir,
how you made that stamp--for I suppose you did make it?”

“Yes, we made it here, and the process we used was practically that
used by photo-engravers in making line blocks; that is to say, we
photographed one of Mr. Hornby’s thumb-prints, printed it on a plate
of chrome-gelatine, developed the plate with hot water and
this”--here he touched the embossed surface of the stamp--“is what
remained. But we could have done it in various other ways; for
instance, with common transfer paper and lithographic stone; indeed,
I assure you, Miller, that there is nothing easier to forge than a
finger-print, and it can be done with such perfection that the forger
himself cannot tell his own forgery from a genuine original, even
when they are placed side by side.”

“Well, I’m hanged,” grunted the superintendent, “you’ve fairly
knocked me, this time, doctor.” He rose gloomily and prepared to
depart. “I suppose,” he added, “your interest in this case has
lapsed, now Belfield’s out of it?”

“Professionally, yes; but I am disposed to finish the case for my own
satisfaction. I am quite curious as to who our too-ingenious friend
may be.”

Miller’s face brightened. “We shall give you every facility, you
know--and that reminds me that Singleton gave me these two
photographs for you, one of the official paper and one of the prints
on the glass. Is there anything more that we can do for you?”

“I should like to have a look at the room in which the murder took
place.”

“You shall, doctor; tomorrow, if you like; I’ll meet you there in the
morning at ten, if that will do.”

It would do excellently, Thorndyke assured him, and with this the
superintendent took his departure in renewed spirits.

We had only just closed the door when there came a hurried and urgent
tapping upon it, whereupon I once more threw it open, and a
quietly-dressed woman in a thick veil, who was standing on the
threshold, stepped quickly past me into the room.

“Where is my husband?” she demanded, as I closed the door; and then,
catching sight of Thorndyke, she strode up to him with a threatening
air and a terrified but angry face.

“What have you done with my husband, sir?” she repeated. “Have you
betrayed him, after giving your word? I met a man who looked like a
police officer on the stairs.”

“Your husband, Mrs. Belfield, is here and quite safe,” replied
Thorndyke. “He has locked himself in that room,” indicating the
office.

Mrs. Belfield darted across and rapped smartly at the door. “Are you
there, Frank?” she called.

In immediate response the key turned, the door opened and Belfield
emerged looking very pale and worn.

“You _have_ kept me a long time in there, sir,” he said.

“It took me a long time to prove to Superintendent Miller that he was
after the wrong man. But I succeeded, and now, Belfield, you are
free. The charge against you is withdrawn.”

Belfield stood for a while as one stupefied, while his wife, after a
moment of silent amazement, flung her arms round his neck and burst
into tears. “But how did you know I was innocent, sir?” demanded the
bewildered Belfield.

“Ah! how did I? Every man to his trade, you know. Well, I
congratulate you, and now go home and have a square meal and get a
good night’s rest.”

He shook hands with his clients--vainly endeavouring to prevent Mrs.
Belfield from kissing his hand--and stood at the open door listening
until the sound of their retreating footsteps died away.

“A noble little woman, Jervis,” said he, as he closed the door. “In
another moment she would have scratched my face--and I mean to find
out the scoundrel who tried to wreck her happiness.”


PART II

THE SHIP OF THE DESERT

The case which I am now about to describe has always appeared to me a
singularly instructive one, as illustrating the value and importance
of that fundamental rule in the carrying out of investigations which
Thorndyke had laid down so emphatically--the rule that all facts, in
any way relating to a case, should be collected impartially and
without reference to any theory, and each fact, no matter how trivial
or apparently irrelevant, carefully studied. But I must not
anticipate the remarks of my learned and talented friend on this
subject which I have to chronicle anon; rather let me proceed to the
case itself.

I had slept at our chambers in King’s Bench Walk--as I commonly did
two or three nights a week--and on coming down to the sitting-room,
found Thorndyke’s man, Polton, putting the last touches to the
breakfast-table, while Thorndyke himself was poring over two
photographs of finger-prints, of which he seemed to be taking
elaborate measurements with a pair of hair-dividers. He greeted me
with his quiet, genial smile and, laying down the dividers, took his
seat at the breakfast-table.

“You are coming with me this morning, I suppose,” said he; “the
Camberwell murder case, you know.”

“Of course I am if you will have me, but I know practically nothing
of the case. Could you give me an outline of the facts that are
known?”

Thorndyke looked at me solemnly, but with a mischievous twinkle.
“This,” he said, “is the old story of the fox and the crow; you ‘bid
me discourse,’ and while I ‘enchant thine ear,’ you claw to windward
with the broiled ham. A deep-laid plot, my learned brother.”

“And such,” I exclaimed, “is the result of contact with the criminal
classes!”

“I am sorry that you regard yourself in that light,” he retorted,
with a malicious smile. “However, with regard to this case. The facts
are briefly these: The murdered man, Caldwell, who seems to have been
formerly a receiver of stolen goods and probably a police spy as
well, lived a solitary life in a small house with only an elderly
woman to attend him.

“A week ago this woman went to visit a married daughter and stayed
the night with her, leaving Caldwell alone in the house. When she
returned on the following morning she found her master lying dead on
the floor of his office, or study, in a small pool of blood.

“The police surgeon found that he had been dead about twelve hours.
He had been killed by a single blow, struck from behind, with some
heavy implement, and a jemmy which lay on the floor beside him fitted
the wound exactly. The deceased wore a dressing-gown and no collar,
and a bedroom candlestick lay upside down on the floor, although gas
was laid on in the room; and as the window of the office appears to
have been forced with the jemmy that was found, and there were
distinct footprints on the flower-bed outside the window, the police
think that the deceased was undressing to go to bed when he was
disturbed by the noise of the opening window; that he went down to
the office and, as he entered, was struck down by the burglar who was
lurking behind the door. On the window-glass the police found the
greasy impression of an open right hand, and, as you know, the
finger-prints were identified by the experts as those of an old
convict named Belfield. As you also know, I proved that those
finger-prints were, in reality, forgeries, executed with rubber or
gelatine stamps. That is an outline of the case.”

The close of this recital brought our meal to an end, and we prepared
for our visit to the scene of the crime. Thorndyke slipped into his
pocket his queer outfit--somewhat like that of a field
geologist--locked up the photographs, and we set forth by way of the
Embankment.

“The police have no clue, I suppose, to the identity of the murderer,
now that the finger-prints have failed?” I asked, as we strode along
together.

“I expect not,” he replied, “though they might have if they examined
their material. I made out a rather interesting point this morning,
which is this: the man who made those sham finger-prints used two
stamps, one for the thumb and the other for the four fingers; and the
original from which those stamps were made was the official
finger-print form.”

“How did you discover that?” I inquired.

“It was very simple. You remember that Mr. Singleton of the
Finger-print Department sent me, by Superintendent Miller, two
photographs, one of the prints on the window and one of the official
form with Belfield’s finger-prints on it. Well, I have compared them
and made the most minute measurements of each, and they are obviously
duplicates. Not only are all the little imperfections on the
form--due to defective inking--reproduced faithfully on the
window-pane, but the relative positions of the four fingers on both
cases agree to the hundredth of an inch. Of course the thumb stamp
was made by taking an oval out of the rolled impression on the form.”

“Then do you suggest that this murder was committed by some one
connected with the Finger-print Department at Scotland Yard?”

“Hardly. But some one has had access to the forms. There has been
leakage somewhere.”

When we arrived at the little detached house in which the murdered
man had lived, the door was opened by an elderly woman, and our
friend, Superintendent Miller, greeted us in the hall.

“We are all ready for you, doctor,” said he. “Of course, the things
have all been gone over once, but we are turning them out more
thoroughly now.” He led the way into the small, barely-furnished
office in which the tragedy had occurred. A dark-stain on the carpet
and a square hole in one of the window-panes furnished memorials of
the crime, which were supplemented by an odd assortment of objects
laid out on the newspaper-covered table. These included silver
teaspoons, watches, various articles of jewellery, from which the
stones had been removed--none of them of any considerable value--and
a roughly-made jemmy.

“I don’t know why Caldwell should have kept all these odds and ends,”
said the detective superintendent. “There is stuff here, that I can
identify, from six different burglaries--and not a conviction among
the six.”

Thorndyke looked over the collection with languid interest; he was
evidently disappointed at finding the room so completely turned out.

“Have you any idea what has been taken?” he asked.

“Not the least. We don’t even know if the safe was opened. The keys
were on the writing-table, so I suppose he went through everything,
though I don’t see why he left these things if he did. We found them
all in the safe.”

“Have you powdered the jemmy?”

The superintendent turned very red. “Yes,” he growled, “but some
half-dozen blithering idiots had handled the thing before I saw
it--been trying it on the window, the blighters--so, of course, it
showed nothing but the marks of their beastly paws.”

“The window had not really been forced, I suppose?” said Thorndyke.

“No,” replied Miller, with a glance of surprise at my colleague,
“that was a plant; so were the footprints. He must have put on a pair
of Caldwell’s boots and gone out and made them--unless Caldwell made
them himself, which isn’t likely.”

“Have you found any letter or telegram?”

“A letter making an appointment for nine o’clock on the night of the
murder. No signature or address, and the handwriting evidently
disguised.”

“Is there anything that furnishes any sort of clue?”

“Yes, sir, there is. There’s this, which we found in the safe.” He
produced a small parcel which he proceeded to unfasten, looking
somewhat queerly at Thorndyke the while. It contained various odds
and ends of jewellery, and a smaller parcel formed of a
pocket-handkerchief tied with tape. This the detective also
unfastened, revealing half-a-dozen silver teaspoons, all engraved
with the same crest, two salt-cellars and a gold locket bearing a
monogram. There was also a half sheet of notepaper on which was
written, in a manifestly disguised hand: “There are the goods I told
you about.--F. B.” But what riveted Thorndyke’s attention and mine
was the handkerchief itself (which was not a very clean one and was
sullied by one or two small bloodstains), for it was marked in one
corner with the name “F. Belfield,” legibly printed in marking-ink
with a rubber stamp.

Thorndyke and the superintendent looked at one another and both
smiled.

“I know what you are thinking, sir,” said the latter.

“I am sure you do,” was the reply, “and it is useless to pretend that
you don’t agree with me.”

“Well, sir,” said Miller doggedly, “if that handkerchief has been put
there as a plant, it’s Belfield’s business to prove it. You see,
doctor,” he added persuasively, “it isn’t this job only that’s
affected. Those spoons, those salt-cellars and that locket are part
of the proceeds of the Winchmore Hill burglary, and we want the
gentleman who did that crack--we want him very badly.”

“No doubt you do,” replied Thorndyke, “but this handkerchief won’t
help you. A sharp counsel--Mr. Anstey, for instance--would demolish
it in five minutes. I assure you, Miller, that handkerchief has no
evidential value whatever, whereas it might prove an invaluable
instrument of research. The best thing you can do is to hand it over
to me and let me see what I can learn from it.”

The superintendent was obviously dissatisfied, but he eventually
agreed, with manifest reluctance, to Thorndyke’s suggestion.

“Very well, doctor,” he said; “you shall have it for a day or two. Do
you want the spoons and things as well?”

“No. Only the handkerchief and the paper that was in it.”

The two articles were accordingly handed to him and deposited in a
tin box which he usually carried in his pocket, and, after a few more
words with the disconsolate detective, we took our departure.

“A very disappointing morning,” was Thorndyke’s comment as we walked
away. “Of course the room ought to have been examined by an expert
before anything was moved.”

“Have you picked up anything in the way of information?” I asked.

“Very little excepting confirmation of my original theory. You see,
this man Caldwell was a receiver and evidently a police spy. He gave
useful information to the police, and they, in return, refrained from
inconvenient inquiries. But a spy, or ‘nark,’ is nearly always a
blackmailer too, and the probabilities in this case are that some
crook, on whom Caldwell was putting the screw rather too tightly,
made an appointment for a meeting when the house was empty, and just
knocked Caldwell on the head. The crime was evidently planned
beforehand, and the murderer came prepared to kill several birds with
one stone. Thus he brought with him the stamps to make the sham
finger-prints on the window, and I have no doubt that he also brought
this handkerchief and the various oddments of plate and jewellery
from those burglaries that Miller is so keen about, and planted them
in the safe. You noticed, I suppose, that none of the things were of
any value, but all were capable of easy identification?”

“Yes, I noticed that. His object, evidently, was to put those
burglaries as well as the murder onto poor Belfield.”

“Exactly. And you see what Miller’s attitude is; Belfield is the bird
in the hand, whereas the other man--if there is another--is still in
the bush; so Belfield is to be followed up and a conviction obtained
if possible. If he is innocent, that is his affair, and it is for him
to prove it.”

“And what shall you do next?” I asked.

“I shall telegraph to Belfield to come and see us this evening. He
may be able to tell us something about this handkerchief that, with
the clue we already have, may put us on the right track. What time is
your consultation?”

“Twelve-thirty--and here comes my ’bus. I shall be in to lunch.” I
sprang onto the footboard, and as I took my seat on the roof and
looked back at my friend striding along with an easy swing, I knew
that he was deep in thought, though automatically attentive to all
that was happening.

My consultation--it was a lunacy case of some importance--was over in
time to allow of my return to our chambers punctually at the luncheon
hour; and as I entered, I was at once struck by something new in
Thorndyke’s manner--a certain elation and gaiety which I had learned
to associate with a point scored successfully in some intricate and
puzzling case. He made no confidences, however, and seemed, in fact,
inclined to put away, for a time, all his professional cares and
business.

“Shall we have an afternoon off, Jervis?” he said gaily. “It is a
fine day and work is slack just now. What say you to the Zoo? They
have a splendid chimpanzee and several specimens of that remarkable
fish _Periophthalmos Kölreuteri_. Shall we go?”

“By all means,” I replied; “and we will mount the elephant, if you
like, and throw buns to the grizzly bear and generally renew our
youth like the eagle.”

But when, an hour later, we found ourselves in the gardens, I began
to suspect my friend of some ulterior purpose in this holiday jaunt;
for it was not the chimpanzee or even the wonderful fish that
attracted his attention. On the contrary, he hung about the vicinity
of the lamas and camels in a way that I could not fail to notice; and
even there it appeared to be the sheds and houses rather than the
animals themselves that interested him.

“Behold, Jervis,” he said presently, as a saddled camel of seedy
aspect was led towards its house, “behold the ship of the desert,
with raised saloon-deck amidships, fitted internally with watertight
compartments and displaying the effects of rheumatoid arthritis in
his starboard hip-joint. Let us go and examine him before he hauls
into dock.” We took a cross-path to intercept the camel on its way to
its residence, and Thorndyke moralized as we went.

“It is interesting,” he remarked, “to note the way in which these
specialized animals, such as the horse, the reindeer and the camel,
have been appropriated by man, and their special character made to
subserve human needs. Think, for instance, of the part the camel has
played in history, in ancient commerce--and modern too, for that
matter--and in the diffusion of culture; and of the rôle he has
enacted in war and conquest from the Egyptian campaign of Cambyses
down to that of Kitchener. Yes, the camel is a very remarkable
animal, though it must be admitted that this particular specimen is a
scurvy-looking beast.”

The camel seemed to be sensible of these disparaging remarks, for as
it approached it saluted Thorndyke with a supercilious grin and then
turned away its head.

“Your charge is not as young as he used to be,” Thorndyke observed to
the man who was leading the animal.

“No, sir, he isn’t; he’s getting old, and that’s the fact. He shows
it too.”

“I suppose,” said Thorndyke, strolling towards the house by the man’s
side, “these beasts require a deal of attention?”

“You’re right, sir; and nasty-tempered brutes they are.”

“So I have heard; but they are interesting creatures, the camels and
lamas. Do you happen to know if complete sets of photographs of them
are to be had here?”

“You can get a good many at the lodge, sir,” the man replied, “but
not all, I think. If you want a complete set, there’s one of our men
in the camel-house that could let you have them; he takes the photos
himself, and very clever he is at it, too. But he isn’t here just
now.”

“Perhaps you could give me his name so that I could write to him,”
said Thorndyke.

“Yes, sir. His name is Woodthorpe--Joseph Woodthorpe. He’ll do
anything for you to order. Thank you, sir; good afternoon, sir;” and
pocketing an unexpected tip, the man led his charge towards its lair.

Thorndyke’s absorbing interest in the camelidæ seemed now suddenly to
become extinct, and he suffered me to lead him to any part of the
gardens that attracted me, showing an imperial interest in all the
inmates from the insects to the elephants, and enjoying his
holiday--if it was one--with the gaiety and high spirits of a
schoolboy. Yet he never let slip a chance of picking up a stray hair
or feather, but gathered up each with care, wrapped it in its
separate paper, on which was written its description, and deposited
it in his tin collecting-box.

“You never know,” he remarked, as we turned away from the ostrich
enclosure, “when a specimen for comparison may be of vital
importance. Here, for instance, is a small feather of a cassowary,
and here the hair of a wapiti deer; now the recognition of either of
those might, in certain circumstances, lead to the detection of a
criminal or save the life of an innocent man. The thing has happened
repeatedly, and may happen again tomorrow.”

“You must have an enormous collection of hairs in your cabinet,” I
remarked, as we walked home.

“I have,” he replied, “probably the largest in the world. And as to
other microscopical objects of medico-legal interest, such as dust
and mud from different localities and from special industries and
manufactures, fibres, food-products and drugs, my collection is
certainly unique.”

“And you have found your collection useful in your work?” I asked.

“Constantly. Over and over again I have obtained, by reference to my
specimens, the most unexpected evidence, and the longer I practise,
the more I become convinced that the microscope is the sheet-anchor
of the medical jurist.”

“By the way,” I said, “you spoke of sending a telegram to Belfield.
Did you send it?”

“Yes. I asked him to come to see me to-night at half-past eight, and,
if possible, bring his wife with him. I want to get to the bottom of
that handkerchief mystery.”

“But do you think he will tell you the truth about it?”

“That is impossible to judge; he will be a fool if he does not. But I
think he will; he has a godly fear of me and my methods.”

As soon as our dinner was finished and cleared away, Thorndyke
produced the “collecting-box” from his pocket and began to sort out
the day’s “catch,” giving explicit directions to Polton for the
disposal of each specimen. The hairs and small feathers were to be
mounted as microscopic objects, while the larger feathers were to be
placed, each in its separate labelled envelope, in its appropriate
box. While these directions were being given, I stood by the window
absently gazing out as I listened, gathering many a useful hint in
the technique of preparation and preservation, and filled with
admiration alike at my colleague’s exhaustive knowledge of practical
detail and the perfect manner in which he had trained his assistant.
Suddenly I started, for a well-known figure was crossing from Crown
Office Row and evidently bearing down on our chambers.

“My word, Thorndyke,” I exclaimed, “here’s a pretty mess!”

“What is the matter?” he asked, looking up anxiously.

“Superintendent Miller heading straight for our doorway. And it is
now twenty minutes past eight.”

Thorndyke laughed. “It will be a quaint position,” he remarked, “and
somewhat of a shock for Belfield. But it really doesn’t matter; in
fact, I think, on the whole, I am rather pleased that he should have
come.”

The superintendent’s brisk knock was heard a few moments later, and
when he was admitted by Polton, he entered and looked round the room
a little sheepishly.

“I am ashamed to come worrying you like this, sir,” he began
apologetically.

“Not at all,” replied Thorndyke, serenely slipping the cassowary’s
feather into an envelope, and writing the name, date and locality on
the outside. “I am your servant in this case, you know. Polton,
whisky and soda for the superintendent.”

“You see, sir,” continued Miller, “our people are beginning to fuss
about this case, and they don’t approve of my having handed that
handkerchief and the paper over to you as they will have to be put in
evidence.”

“I thought they might object,” remarked Thorndyke.

“So did I, sir; and they do. And, in short, they say that I have got
to get them back at once. I hope it won’t put you out, sir.”

“Not in the least,” said Thorndyke. “I have asked Belfield to come
here to-night--I expect him in a few minutes--and when I have heard
what he has to say I shall have no further use for the handkerchief.”

“You’re not going to show it to him!” exclaimed the detective, aghast.

“Certainly I am.”

“You mustn’t do that, sir. I can’t sanction it; I can’t indeed.”

“Now, look you here, Miller,” said Thorndyke, shaking his forefinger
at the officer; “I am working for you in this case, as I have told
you. Leave the matter in my hands. Don’t raise silly objections; and
when you leave here to night you will take with you not only the
handkerchief and the paper, but probably also the name and address of
the man who committed this murder and those various burglaries that
you are so keen about.”

“Is that really so, sir?” exclaimed the astonished detective. “Well,
you haven’t let the grass grow under your feet. Ah!” as a gentle rap
at the door was heard, “here’s Belfield, I suppose.”

It was Belfield--accompanied by his wife--and mightily disturbed they
were when their eyes lighted on our visitor.

“You needn’t be afraid of me, Belfield,” said Miller, with ferocious
geniality; “I am not here after you.” Which was not literally true,
though it served to reassure the affrighted ex-convict.

“The superintendent dropped in by chance,” said Thorndyke; “but it is
just as well that he should hear what passes. I want you to look at
this handkerchief and tell me if it is yours. Don’t be afraid, but
just tell us the simple truth.”

He took the handkerchief out of a drawer and spread it on the table;
and I now observed that a small square had been cut out of one of the
bloodstains.

Belfield took the handkerchief in his trembling hands, and as his eye
fell on the stamped name in the corner he turned deadly pale.

“It looks like mine,” he said huskily. “What do you say, Liz?” he
added, passing it to his wife.

Mrs. Belfield examined first the name and then the hem. “It’s yours,
right enough, Frank,” said she. “It’s the one that got changed in the
wash. You see, sir,” she continued, addressing Thorndyke, “I bought
him half-a-dozen new ones about six months ago, and I got a rubber
stamp made and marked them all. Well, one day when I was looking over
his things I noticed that one of his handkerchiefs had got no mark on
it. I spoke to the laundress about it, but she couldn’t explain it,
so as the right one never came back, I marked the one that we got in
exchange.”

“How long ago was that?” asked Thorndyke.

“About two months ago I noticed it.”

“And you know nothing more about it.”

“Nothing whatever, sir. Nor you, Frank, do you?”

Her husband shook his head gloomily, and Thorndyke replaced the
handkerchief in the drawer.

“And now,” said he, “I am going to ask you a question on another
subject. When you were at Holloway there was a warder--or assistant
warder--there, named Woodthorpe. Do you remember him?”

“Yes, sir, very well indeed; in fact, it was him that----”

“I know,” interrupted Thorndyke. “Have you seen him since you left
Holloway?”

“Yes, sir, once. It was last Easter Monday. I met him at the Zoo; he
is a keeper there now in the camel-house” (here a sudden light dawned
upon me and I chuckled aloud, to Belfield’s great astonishment). “He
gave my little boy a ride on one of the camels and made himself very
pleasant.”

“Do you remember anything else happening?” Thorndyke inquired.

“Yes, sir. The camel had a little accident; he kicked out--he was an
ill-tempered beast--and his leg hit a post; there happened to be a
nail sticking out from that post, and it tore up a little flap of
skin. Then Woodthorpe got out his hand kerchief to tie up the wound,
but as it was none of the cleanest, I said to him: ‘Don’t use that,
Woodthorpe; have mine,’ which was quite a clean one. So he took it
and bound up the camel’s leg, and he said to me: ‘I’ll have it washed
and send it to you if you give me your address.’ But I told him there
was no need for that; I should be passing the camel-house on my way
out and I would look in for the handkerchief. And I did: I looked in
about an hour later, and Woodthorpe gave me my handkerchief, folded
up but not washed.”

“Did you examine it to see if it was yours?” asked Thorndyke.

“No, sir. I just slipped it in my pocket as it was.”

“And what became of it afterwards?”

“When I got home I dropped it into the dirty-linen basket.”

“Is that all you know about it?”

“Yes, sir; that is all I know.”

“Very well, Belfield, that will do. Now you have no reason to be
uneasy. You will soon know all about the Camberwell murder--that is,
if you read the papers.”

The ex-convict and his wife were obviously relieved by this assurance
and departed in quite good spirits. When they were gone, Thorndyke
produced the handkerchief and the half-sheet of paper and handed them
to the superintendent, remarking--

“This is highly satisfactory, Miller; the whole case seems to join up
very neatly indeed. Two months ago the wife first noticed the
substituted handkerchief, and last Easter Monday--a little over two
months ago--this very significant incident took place in the
Zoological Gardens.”

“That is all very well, sir,” objected the superintendent, “but we’ve
only their word for it, you know.”

“Not so,” replied Thorndyke. “We have excellent corroborative
evidence. You noticed that I had cut a small piece out of the
bloodstained portion of the handkerchief?”

“Yes; and I was sorry you had done it. Our people won’t like that.”

“Well, here it is, and we will ask Dr. Jervis to give us his opinion
of it.”

From the drawer in which the handkerchief had been hidden he brought
forth a microscope slide, and setting the microscope on the table,
laid the slide on the stage.

“Now, Jervis,” he said, “tell us what you see there.”

I examined the edge of the little square of fabric (which had been
mounted in a fluid reagent) with a high-power objective, and was, for
a time, a little puzzled by the appearance of the blood that adhered
to it.

“It looks like bird’s blood,” I said presently, with some hesitation,
“but yet I can make out no nuclei.” I looked again, and then,
suddenly, “By Jove!” I exclaimed, “I have it; of course! It’s the
blood of a camel!”

“Is that so, doctor?” demanded the detective, leaning forward in his
excitement.

“That is so,” replied Thorndyke. “I discovered it after I came home
this morning. You see,” he explained, “it is quite unmistakable. The
rule is that the blood corpuscles of mammals are circular; the one
exception is the camel family, in which the corpuscles are
elliptical.”

“Why,” exclaimed Miller, “that seems to connect Woodthorpe with this
Camberwell job.”

“It connects him with it very conclusively,” said Thorndyke. “You are
forgetting the finger-prints.”

The detective looked puzzled. “What about them?” he asked.

“They were made with stamps--two stamps, as a matter of fact--and
those stamps were made by photographic process from the official
finger-print form. I can prove that beyond all doubt.”

“Well, suppose they were. What then?”

Thorndyke opened a drawer and took out a photograph, which he handed
to Miller. “Here,” he said, “is the photograph of the official
finger-print form which you were kind enough to bring me. What does
it say at the bottom there?” and he pointed with his finger.

The superintendent read aloud: “Impressions taken by Joseph
Woodthorpe. Rank, Warder; Prison, Holloway.” He stared at the
photograph for a moment, and then exclaimed--

“Well, I’m hanged! You _have_ worked this out neatly, doctor! and so
quick too. We’ll have Mr. Woodthorpe under lock and key the first
thing to-morrow morning. But how did he do it, do you think?”

“He might have taken duplicate finger-prints and kept one form; the
prisoners would not know there was anything wrong; but he did not in
this case. He must have contrived to take a photograph of the form
before sending it in--it would take a skilful photographer only a
minute or two with a suitable hand-camera placed on a table at the
proper distance from the wall; and I have ascertained that he is a
skilful photographer. You will probably find the apparatus, and the
stamps too, when you search his rooms.”

“Well, well. You do give us some surprises, doctor. But I must be off
now to see about this warrant. Good-night, sir, and many thanks for
your help.”

When the superintendent had gone we sat for a while looking at one
another in silence. At length Thorndyke spoke. “Here is a case,
Jervis,” he said, “which, simple as it is, teaches a most invaluable
lesson--a lesson which you should take well to heart. It is this:
_The evidential value of any fact is an unknown quantity until the
fact has been examined._ That seems a self-evident truth, but like
many other self-evident truths, it is constantly overlooked in
practice. Take this present case. When I left Caldwell’s house this
morning the facts in my possession were these: (1) The man who
murdered Caldwell was directly or indirectly connected with the
Finger-print Department. (2) He was almost certainly a skilled
photographer. (3) He probably committed the Winchmore Hill and the
other burglaries. (4) He was known to Caldwell, had had professional
dealings with him and was probably being blackmailed. This was all; a
very vague clue, as you see.

“There was the handkerchief, planted, as I had no doubt, but could
not prove; the name stamped on it was Belfield’s, but any one can get
a rubber stamp made. Then it was stained with blood, as handkerchiefs
often are; that blood might or might not be human blood; it did not
seem to matter a straw whether it was or not. Nevertheless, I said to
myself: If it is human, or at least mammalian blood, that is a fact;
and if it is not human blood, that is also a fact. I will have that
fact, and then I shall know what its value is. I examined the stain
when I reached home, and behold! it was camel’s blood; and
immediately this insignificant fact swelled up into evidence of
primary importance. The rest was obvious. I had seen Woodthorpe’s
name on the form, and I knew several other officials. My business was
to visit all places in London where there were camels, to get the
names of all persons connected with them and to ascertain if any
among them was a photographer. Naturally I went first to the Zoo, and
at the very first cast hooked Joseph Woodthorpe. Wherefore I say
again: Never call any fact irrelevant until you have examined it.”

The remarkable evidence given above was not heard at the trial, nor
did Thorndyke’s name appear among the witnesses; for when the police
searched Woodthorpe’s rooms, so many incriminating articles were
found (including a pair of finger-print stamps which exactly answered
to Thorndyke’s description of them, and a number of photographs of
finger-print forms) that his guilt was put beyond all doubt; and
society was shortly after relieved of a very undesirable member.

Chapter I

The Invalid

Looking back on events by the light of experience I perceive clearly
that the thunder-cloud which burst on me and on those who were dear to
me had not gathered unseen. It is true that it had rolled up swiftly;
that the premonitory mutterings, now so distinct but then so faint and
insignificant, gave but a brief warning. But that was of little
consequence, since whatever warnings there were passed unheeded, as
warnings commonly do, being susceptible of interpretation only by
means of the subsequent events which they foreshadowed.

The opening scene of the tragedy—if I had but realized it—was the
arrival of the Reverend Amos Monkhouse from his far-away Yorkshire
parish at the house of his brother Harold. I happened to be there at
the time; and though it was not my concern, since Harold had a
secretary, I received the clergyman when he was announced. We knew one
another well enough by name though we had never met, and it was with
some interest and curiosity that I looked at the keen-faced, sturdy,
energetic-looking parson and contrasted him with his physically frail
and rather characterless brother. He looked at me, too, curiously and
with a certain appearance of surprise, which did not diminish when I
told him who I was.

“Ha!” said he, “yes. Mr. Mayfield. I am glad to have the opportunity
of making your acquaintance. I have heard a good deal about you from
Harold and Barbara. Now I can fit you with a visible personality. By
the way, the maid tells me that Barbara is not at home.”

“No, she is away on her travels in Kent.”

“In Kent!” he repeated, raising his eyebrows.

“Yes, on one of her political expeditions; organizing some sort of
women’s emancipation movement. I daresay you have heard about it.”

He nodded a little impatiently. “Yes. Then I assume that Harold is not
so ill as I had supposed?”

I was inclined to be evasive; for, to be quite candid, I had thought
more than once that Barbara might properly have given a little less
attention to her political hobbies and a little more to her sick
husband. So I replied cautiously:

“I really don’t quite know what his condition is. You see, when a man
has chronically bad health, one rather loses count. Harold has his ups
and downs, but he always looks pretty poorly. Just now, I should say
he is rather below his average.”

“Ha! Well, perhaps I had better go up and have a look at him. The maid
has told him that I am here. I wonder if you would be so kind as to
show me the way to his room. I have not been in this house before.”

I conducted him up to the door of the bedroom and then returned to the
library to wait for him and hear what he thought of the invalid. And
now that the question had been raised, I was not without a certain
uneasiness. What I had said was true enough. When a man is always
ailing one gets to take his ill-health for granted and to assume that
it will go on without any significant change. One repeats the old
saying of “the creaking gate” and perhaps makes unduly light of
habitual illness. Might it be that Harold was being a little
neglected? He had certainly looked bad enough when I had called on him
that morning. Was it possible that he was really seriously ill?
Perhaps in actual danger?

I had just asked myself this question when the door was opened
abruptly and the clergyman strode into the room. Something in his
expression—a mingling, as it seemed, of anger and alarm—rather
startled me; nevertheless I asked him calmly enough how he found his
brother. He stared at me, almost menacingly, for a second or two; then
slowly and with harsh emphasis he replied: “I am shocked at the change
in him. I am horrified. Why, good God, Sir! the man is dying!”

“I think that can hardly be,” I objected. “The doctor saw him this
morning and did not hint at anything of the sort. He thought he was
not very well but he made no suggestion as to there being any danger.”

“How long has the doctor been attending him?”

“For something like twenty years, I believe; so by this time he ought
to understand the patient’s—”

“Tut-tut,” the parson interrupted, impatiently, “what did you say
yourself but a few minutes ago? One loses count of the chronic
invalid. He exhausts our attention until, at last, we fail to observe
the obvious. What is wanted is a fresh eye. Can you give me the
doctor’s address? Because, if you can, I will call on him and arrange
a consultation. I told Harold that I wanted a second opinion and he
made no objection; in fact he seemed rather relieved. If we get a
really first-class physician, we may save him yet.”

“I think you are taking an unduly gloomy view of Harold’s condition,”
said I. “At any rate, I hope so. But I entirely agree with you as to
the advisability of having further advice. I know where Dr. Dimsdale
lives so if you like I will walk round with you.”

He accepted my offer gladly and we set forth at once, walking briskly
along the streets, each of us wrapped in thought and neither speaking
for some time. Presently I ventured to remark:

“Strictly, I suppose, we ought to have consulted Barbara before
seeking another opinion.”

“I don’t see why,” he replied. “Harold is a responsible person and has
given his free consent. If Barbara is so little concerned about him as
to go away from home—and for such a trumpery reason, too—I don’t see
that we need consider her. Still, as a matter of common civility, I
might as well send her a line. What is her present address?”

“Do you know,” I said, shamefacedly, “I am afraid I can’t tell you
exactly where she is at the moment. Her permanent address, when she is
away on these expeditions, is the head-quarters of the Women’s
Friendship League at Maidstone.”

He stopped for a moment and glowered at me with an expression of sheer
amazement. “Do you mean to tell me,” he exclaimed, “that she has gone
away, leaving her husband in this condition, and that she is not even
within reach of a telegram?”

“I have no doubt that a telegram or letter would be forwarded to her.”

He emitted an angry snort and then demanded:

“How long has she been away?”

“About a fortnight,” I admitted, reluctantly.

“A fortnight!” he repeated in angry astonishment. “And all that time
beyond reach of communication! Why the man might have been dead and
buried and she none the wiser!”

“He was much better when she went away,” I said, anxious to make the
best of what I felt to be a rather bad case. “In fact, he seemed to be
getting on quite nicely. It is only during the last few days that he
has got this set-back. Of course, Barbara is kept informed as to his
condition. Madeline sends her a letter every few days.”

“But, my dear Mr. Mayfield,” he expostulated, “just consider the state
of affairs in this amazing household. I came to see my brother,
expecting—from the brief letter that I had from him—to find him
seriously ill. And I do find him seriously ill; dangerously ill, I
should say. And what sort of care is being taken of him? His wife is
away from home, amusing herself with her platform fooleries, and has
left no practicable address. His secretary, or whatever you call him,
Wallingford, is not at home. Madeline is, of course, occupied in her
work at the school. Actually, the only person in the house besides the
servants is yourself—a friend of the family but not a member of the
household at all. You must admit that it is a most astonishing and
scandalous state of affairs.”

I was saved from the necessity of answering this rather awkward
question by our arrival at Dr. Dimsdale’s house; and, as it
fortunately happened that the doctor was at home and disengaged, we
were shown almost at once into his consulting room.

I knew Dr. Dimsdale quite well and rather liked him though I was not
deeply impressed by his abilities. However, his professional skill was
really no concern of mine, and his social qualities were
unexceptionable. In appearance and manner he had always seemed to me
the very type of a high-class general practitioner, and so he
impressed me once more as we were ushered into his sanctum. He shook
hands with me genially, and as I introduced the Reverend Amos looked
at him with a politely questioning expression. But the clergyman lost
no time in making clear the purpose of his visit; in fact he came to
the point with almost brutal abruptness.

“I have just seen my brother for the first time for several months and
I am profoundly shocked at his appearance. I expected to find him ill,
but I did not understand that he was so ill as I find him.”

“No,” Dr. Dimsdale agreed, gravely, “I suppose not. You have caught
him at a rather unfortunate time. He is certainly not so well to-day.”

“Well!” exclaimed Amos. “To me he has the look of a dying man. May I
ask what, exactly, is the matter with him?”

The doctor heaved a patient sigh and put his fingertips together.

“The word ‘exactly,’” he replied, with a faint smile, “makes your
question a little difficult to answer. There are so many things the
matter with him. For the last twenty years, on and off, I have
attended him, and during the whole of that time his health has been
unsatisfactory—most unsatisfactory. His digestion has always been
defective, his circulation feeble, he has had functional trouble with
his heart, and throughout the winter months, more or less continuous
respiratory troubles—nasal and pulmonary catarrh and sometimes rather
severe bronchitis.”

The Reverend Amos nodded impatiently. “Quite so, quite so. But, to
come from the past to the present, what is the matter with him now?”

“That,” the doctor replied suavely, “is what I was coming to. I
mentioned the antecedents to account for the consequents. The
complaints from which your brother has suffered in the past have been
what are called functional complaints. But functional disease—if there
really is such a thing—must, in the end, if it goes on long enough,
develop into organic disease. Its effects are cumulative. Each slight
illness leaves the bodily organs a little less fit.”

“Yes?”

“Well, that is, I fear, what is happening in your brother’s case. The
functional illnesses of the past are tending to take on an organic
character.”

“Ha!” snorted the Reverend Amos. “But what is his actual condition
now? To put it bluntly, supposing he were to die to-night, what would
you write on the death certificate?”

“Dear me!” said the doctor. “That is putting it very bluntly. I hope
the occasion will not arise.”

“Still, I suppose you don’t regard his death as an impossible
contingency?”

“Oh, by no means. Chronic illness confers no immortality, as I have
just been pointing out.”

“Then, supposing his death to occur, what would you state to be the
cause?”

Dr. Dimsdale’s habitual suavity showed a trace of diminution as he
replied: “You are asking a very unusual and hardly admissible
question, Mr. Monkhouse. However, I may say that if your brother were
to die to-night he would die from some definite cause, which would be
duly set forth in the certificate. As he is suffering from chronic
gastritis, chronic bronchial catarrh, functional disorder of the heart
and several other morbid conditions, these would be added as
contributory causes. But may I ask what is the object of these very
pointed questions?”

“My object,” replied Amos, “was to ascertain whether the circumstances
justified a consultation. It seems to me that they do. I am extremely
disturbed about my brother. Would you have any objection to meeting a
consultant?”

“But not in the least. On the contrary, I should be very glad to talk
over this rather indefinite case with an experienced physician who
would come to it with a fresh eye. Of course, the patient’s consent
would be necessary.”

“He has consented, and he agreed to the consultant whom I proposed—Sir
Robert Detling—if you concurred.”

“I do certainly. I could suggest no better man. Shall I arrange with
him or will you?”

“Perhaps I had better,” the parson replied, “as I know him fairly
well. We were of the same year at Cambridge. I shall go straight on to
him now and will let you know at once what arrangement he proposes.”

“Excellent,” said the doctor, rising with all his suavity restored. “I
shall keep to-morrow as free as I can until I hear from you, and I
hope he will be able to manage it so soon. I shall be glad to hear
what he thinks of our patient, and I trust that the consultation may
be helpful in the way of treatment.”

He shook our hands heartily and conducted us to the street door,
whence he launched us safely into the street.

“That is a very suave gentleman,” Amos remarked as we turned away.
“Quite reasonable, too; but you see for yourself that he has no real
knowledge of the case. He couldn’t give the illness an intelligible
name.”

“It seemed to me that he gave it a good many names, and it may well be
that it is no more than he seems to think; a sort of collective
illness, the resultant of the various complaints that he mentioned.
However, we shall know more when Sir Robert has seen him; and
meanwhile, I wouldn’t worry too much about the apparent neglect. Your
brother, unlike most chronic invalids, doesn’t hanker for attention.
He has all he wants and he likes to be left alone with his books.
Shall you see him again to-day?”

“Assuredly. As soon as I have arranged matters with Detling I shall
let Dr. Dimsdale know what we have settled and I shall then go back
and spend the evening with my brother. Perhaps I shall see you
to-morrow?”

“No. I have to run down to Bury St. Edmunds to-morrow morning and I
shall probably be there three or four days. But I should very much
like to hear what happens at the consultation. Could you send me a few
lines? I shall be staying at the Angel.”

“I will certainly,” he replied, halting and raising his umbrella to
signal an approaching omnibus. “Just a short note to let you know what
Sir Robert has to tell us of poor Harold’s condition.”

He waved his hand, and stepping off the kerb, hopped on to the
foot-board of the omnibus as it slowed down, and vanished into the
interior. I stood for a few moments watching the receding vehicle,
half inclined to go back and take another look at the sick man; but
reflecting that his brother would be presently returning, I abandoned
the idea and made my way instead to the Underground Railway station
and there took a ticket for the Temple.

There is something markedly infectious in states of mind. Hitherto I
had given comparatively little attention to Harold Monkhouse. He was a
more or less chronic invalid, suffering now from one complaint and now
from another, and evidently a source of no particular anxiety either
to his friends or to his doctor. He was always pallid and
sickly-looking, and if, on this particular morning, he had seemed to
look more haggard and ghastly than usual, I had merely noted that he
was “not so well to-day.”

But the appearance on the scene of the Reverend Amos had put a rather
different complexion on the affair. His visit to his brother had
resulted in a severe shock, which he had passed on to me; and I had to
admit that our interview with Dr. Dimsdale had not been reassuring.
For the fact which had emerged from it was that the doctor could not
give the disease a name.

It was very disquieting. Supposing it should turn out that Harold was
suffering from some grave, even some mortal disease, which ought to
have been detected and dealt with months ago. How should we all feel?
How, in particular, would Barbara feel about the easygoing way in
which the illness had been allowed to drift on? It was an
uncomfortable thought; and though Harold Monkhouse was really no
concern of mine, excepting that he was Barbara’s husband, it continued
to haunt me as I sat in the rumbling train and as I walked up from the
Temple station to my chambers in Fig Tree Court.



Chapter II

Barbara Monkhouse Comes Home

In the intervals of my business at Bury St. Edmunds I gave more than a
passing thought to the man who was lying sick in the house in the
quiet square at Kensington. It was not that I had any very deep
feeling for him as a friend, though I liked him well enough. But the
idea had got into my mind that he had perhaps been treated with
something less than ordinary solicitude; that his illness had been
allowed to drift on when possibly some effective measures might have
been taken for his relief. And as it had never occurred to me to make
any suggestions on the matter or to interest myself particularly in
his condition, I was now inclined to regard myself as a party to the
neglect, if there had really been any culpable failure of attention. I
therefore awaited with some anxiety the letter which Amos had promised
to send.

It was not until the morning of my third day at Bury that it arrived;
and when I had opened and read it I found myself even less reassured
than I had expected.

  “Dear Mayfield,” it ran. “The consultation took place this afternoon
  and the result is, in my opinion, highly unsatisfactory. Sir Robert
  is, at present, unable to say definitely what is the matter with
  Harold. He states that he finds the case extremely obscure and
  reserves his opinion until the blood-films and other specimens which
  he took, have been examined and reported on by an expert
  pathologist. But on one point he is perfectly clear. He regards
  Harold’s condition as extremely grave—even critical—and he advised
  me to send a telegram to Barbara insisting on her immediate return
  home. Which I have done; and only hope it may reach her in the
  course of the day.

  That is all I have to tell you and I think you will agree that it is
  not an encouraging report. Medical science must be in a very
  backward state if two qualified practitioners—one of them an eminent
  physician—cannot between them muster enough professional knowledge
  to say what is the matter with a desperately sick man. However, I
  hope that we shall have a diagnosis by the time you come back.

                                             Yours sincerely,
                                                  Amos Monkhouse.”

I could not but agree, in the main, that my clerical friend’s rather
gloomy view was justified, though I thought that he was a trifle
unfair to the doctors, especially to Sir Robert. Probably a less
scientific practitioner, who would have given the condition some sort
of name, would have been more satisfying to the parson. Meanwhile, I
allowed myself to build on “the blood-films and other specimens” hopes
of a definite discovery which might point the way to some effective
treatment.

I despatched my business by the following evening and returned to
London by the night train, arriving at my chambers shortly before
midnight. With some eagerness I emptied the letter-cage in the hope of
finding a note from Amos or Barbara; but there was none, although
there were one or two letters from solicitors which required to be
dealt with at once. I read these through and considered their contents
while I was undressing, deciding to get up early and reply to them so
that I might have the forenoon free; and this resolution I carried out
so effectively that by ten o’clock in the morning I had breakfasted,
answered and posted the letters, and was on my way westward in an
Inner Circle train.

It was but a few minutes’ walk from South Kensington Station to
Hilborough Square and I covered the short distance more quickly than
usual. Turning into the square, I walked along the pavement on the
garden side, according to my habit, until I was nearly opposite the
house. Then I turned to cross the road and as I did so, looked up at
the house. And at the first glance I stopped short and stared in
dismay: for the blinds were lowered in all the windows. For a couple
of seconds I stood and gazed at this ominous spectacle; then I hurried
across the road and, instinctively avoiding the knocker, gave a gentle
pull at the bell.

The door was opened by the housemaid, who looked at me somewhat
strangely but admitted me without a word and shut the door softly
behind me. I glanced at her set face and asked in a low voice:

“Why are all the blinds down, Mabel?”

“Didn’t you know, Sir?” she replied, almost in a whisper. “It’s the
master—Mr. Monkhouse. He passed away in the night. I found him dead
when I went in this morning to draw up the blinds and give him his
early tea.”

I gazed at the girl in consternation, and after a pause she continued:

“It gave me an awful turn, Sir, for I didn’t see, at first, what had
happened. He was lying just as he usually did, and looked as if he had
gone to sleep, reading. He had a book in his hand, resting on the
counterpane, and I could see that his candle-lamp had burned itself
right out. I put his tea on the bedside table and spoke to him, and
when he didn’t answer I spoke again a little louder. And then I
noticed that he was perfectly still and looked even paler and more
yellow than usual and I began to feel nervous about him. So I touched
his hand; and it was as cold as stone and as stiff as a wooden hand.
Then I felt sure he must be dead and I ran away and told Miss Norris.”

“Miss Norris!” I exclaimed.

“Yes, Sir. Mrs. Monkhouse only got home about an hour ago. She was
fearfully upset when she found she was too late. Miss Norris is with
her now, but I expect she’ll be awfully glad you’ve come. She was
asking where you were. Shall I tell her you are here?”

“If you please, Mabel,” I replied; and as the girl retired up the
stairs with a stealthy, funereal tread, I backed into the open doorway
of the dining room (avoiding the library, in case Wallingford should
be there) where I remained until Mabel returned with a message asking
me to go up.

I think I have seldom felt more uncomfortable than I did as I walked
slowly and softly up the stairs. The worst had happened—at least, so I
thought—and we all stood condemned; but Barbara most of all. I tried
to prepare some comforting, condolent phrases, but could think of
nothing but the unexplainable, inexcusable fact that Barbara had of
her own choice and for her own purposes, gone away leaving a sick
husband and had come back to find him dead.

As I entered the pleasant little boudoir—now gloomy enough, with its
lowered blinds—the two women rose from the settee on which they had
been sitting together, and Barbara came forward to meet me, holding
out both her hands.

“Rupert!” she exclaimed, “how good of you! But it is like you to be
here just when we have need of you.” She took both my hands and
continued, looking rather wildly into my face: “Isn’t it an awful
thing? Poor, poor Harold! So patient and uncomplaining! And I so
neglectful, so callous! I shall never, never forgive myself. I have
been a selfish, egotistical brute.”

“We are all to blame,” I said, since I could not honestly dispute her
self-accusations; “and Dr. Dimsdale not the least. Harold has been the
victim of his own patience. Does Amos know?”

“Yes,” answered Madeline, “I sent him a telegram at half-past eight. I
should have sent you one, too, but I didn’t know that you had come
back.”

There followed a slightly awkward silence during which I reflected
with some discomfort on the impending arrival of the dead man’s
brother, which might occur at any moment. It promised to be a somewhat
unpleasant incident, for Amos alone had gauged the gravity of his
brother’s condition, and he was an outspoken man. I only hoped that he
would not be too outspoken.

The almost embarrassing silence was broken by Barbara, who asked in a
low voice: “Will you go and see him, Rupert?” and added: “You know the
way and I expect you would rather go alone.”

I said “yes” as I judged that she did not wish to come with me, and,
walking out of the room, took my way along the corridor to the
well-remembered door, at which I halted for a moment, with an
unreasonable impulse to knock, and then entered. A solemn dimness
pervaded the room, with its lowered blinds, and an unusual silence
seemed to brood over it. But everything was clearly visible in the
faint, diffused light—the furniture, the pictures on the walls, the
bookshelves and the ghostly shape upon the bed, half-revealed through
the sheet which had been laid over it.

Softly, I drew back the sheet, and the vague shape became a man; or
rather, as it seemed, a waxen effigy, with something in its aspect at
once strange and familiar. The features were those of Harold
Monkhouse, but yet the face was not quite the face that I had known.
So it has always seemed to me with the dead. They have their own
distinctive character which belongs to no living man—the physiognomy
of death; impassive, expressionless, immovable; fixed for ever, or at
least, until the changes of the tomb shall obliterate even its
semblance of humanity.

I stepped back a pace and looked thoughtfully at the dead man who had
slipped so quietly out of the land of the living. There he lay,
stretched out in an easy, restful posture, just as I had often seen
him; the eyes half-closed and one long, thin arm lying on the
counterpane, the waxen hand lightly grasping the open volume;
looking—save for the stony immobility—as he might if he had fallen
asleep over his book. It was not surprising that the housemaid had
been deceived, for the surroundings all tended to support the
illusion. The bedside table with its pathetic little provisions for a
sick man’s needs: the hooded candle-lamp, drawn to the table-edge and
turned to light the book; the little decanter of brandy, the unused
tumbler, the water-bottle, the watch, still ticking in its upright
case, the candle-box, two or three spare volumes and the hand-bell for
night use; all spoke of illness and repose with never a hint of death.

There was nothing by which I could judge when he had died. I touched
his arm and found it rigid as an iron bar. So Mabel had found it some
hours earlier, whence I inferred that death had occurred not much past
midnight. But the doctors would be able to form a better opinion, if
it should seem necessary to form any opinion at all. More to the point
than the exact time of death was the exact cause. I recalled the blunt
question that Amos had put to Dr. Dimsdale and the almost indignant
tone in which the latter had put it aside. That was less than a week
ago; and now that question had to be answered in unequivocal terms. I
found myself wondering what the politic and plausible Dimsdale would
put on the death certificate and whether he would seek Sir Robert
Detling’s collaboration in the execution of that document.

I was about to replace the sheet when my ear caught the footsteps of
some one approaching on tip-toe along the corridor. The next moment
the door opened softly and Amos stole into the room. He passed me with
a silent greeting and drew near the bed, beside which he halted with
his hand laid on the dead hand and his eyes fixed gloomily on the
yellowish-white, impassive face. He spoke no word, nor did I presume
to disturb this solemn meeting and farewell, but silently slipped out
into the corridor where I waited for him to come out.

Two or three minutes passed, during which I heard him, once or twice,
moving softly about the room and judged that he was examining the
surroundings amidst which his brother had passed the last few weeks of
his life. Presently he came out, closing the door noiselessly behind
him, and joined me opposite the window. I looked a little nervously
into the stern, grief-stricken face, and as he did not speak, I said,
lamely enough:

“This is a grievous and terrible thing, Mr. Monkhouse.” He shook his
head gravely. “Grievous indeed; and the more so if one suspects, as I
do, that it need not have happened. However, he is gone and
recriminations will not bring him back.”

“No,” I agreed, profoundly relieved and a little surprised at his
tone; “whatever we may feel or think, reproaches and bitter words will
bring no remedy. Have you seen Barbara?”

“No; and I think I won’t—this morning. In a day or two, I hope I shall
be able to meet and speak to her as a Christian man should. To-day I
am not sure of myself. You will let me know what arrangements are made
about the funeral?”

I promised that I would, and walked with him to the head of the
stairs, and when I had watched him descend and heard the street door
close, I went back to Barbara’s little sitting-room.

I found her alone, and, when I entered she was standing before a
miniature that hung on the wall. She looked round as I entered and I
saw that she still looked rather dazed and strange. Her eyes were red,
as if she had been weeping but they were now tearless, and she seemed
calmer than when I had first seen her. I went to her side, and for a
few moments we stood silently regarding the smiling, girlish face that
looked out at us from the miniature. It was that of Barbara’s
step-sister, a very sweet, loveable girl, little more than a child,
who had died some four years previously, and who, I had sometimes
thought, was the only human creature for whom Barbara had felt a
really deep affection. The miniature had been painted from a
photograph after her death and a narrow plait of her gorgeous,
red-gold hair had been carried round inside the frame.

“Poor little Stella!” Barbara murmured. “I have been asking myself if
I neglected her, too. I often left her for days at a time.”

“You mustn’t be morbid, Barbara,” I said. “The poor child was very
well looked after and as happy as she could be made. And nobody could
have done any more for her. Rapid consumption is beyond the resources
of medical science at present.”

“Yes, unfortunately.” She was silent for a while. Then she said: “I
wonder if anything could have been done for Harold. Do you think it
possible that he might have been saved?”

“I know of no reason for thinking so, and now that he is gone I see no
use in raising the question.”

She drew closer to me and slipped her hand into mine.

“You will be with us as much as you can, Rupert, won’t you? We always
look to you in trouble or difficulty, and you have never failed us.
Even now you don’t condemn me, whatever you may think.”

“No, I blame myself for not being more alert, though it was really
Dimsdale who misled us all. Has Madeline gone to the school?”

“Yes. She had to give a lecture or demonstration, but I hope she will
manage to get a day or two off duty. I don’t want to be left alone
with poor Tony. It sounds unkind to say so, for no one could be more
devoted to me than he is. But he is so terribly high-strung. Just now,
he is in an almost hysterical state. I suppose you haven’t seen him
this morning?”

“No. I came straight up to you.” I had, in fact, kept out of his way,
for, to speak the truth, I did not much care for Anthony Wallingford.
He was of a type that I dislike rather intensely; nervous,
high-strung, emotional and in an incessant state of purposeless
bustle. I did not like his appearance, his manners or his dress. I
resented the abject fawning way in which he followed Barbara about,
and I disapproved of his position in this house; which was nominally
that of secretary to Barbara’s husband, but actually that of tame cat
and generally useless hanger-on. I think I was on the point of making
some disparaging comments on him, but at that moment there came a
gentle tap at the door and the subject of my thoughts entered.

I was rather sorry that Barbara was still holding my hand. Of course,
the circumstances were very exceptional, but I have an Englishman’s
dislike of emotional demonstrations in the presence of third parties.
Nevertheless, Wallingford’s behaviour filled me with amazed
resentment. He stopped short with a face black as thunder, and, after
a brief, insolent stare, muttered that he “was afraid he was
intruding” and walked out of the room, closing the door sharply after
him.

Barbara flushed (and I daresay I did, too), but made no outward sign
of annoyance. “You see what I mean,” she said. “The poor fellow is
quite unstrung. He is an added anxiety instead of a help.”

“I see that plainly enough,” I replied, “but I don’t see why he is
unstrung, or why an unstrung man should behave like an ill-mannered
child. At any rate, he will have to pull himself together. There is a
good deal to be done and he will have to do some of it. I may assume,
I suppose, that it will be his duty to carry out the instructions of
the executors?”

“I suppose so. But you know more about such things than I do.”

“Then I had better go down and explain the position to him and set him
to work. Presently I must call on Mr. Brodribb, the other executor,
and let him know what has happened. But meanwhile there are certain
things which have to be done at once. You understand?”

“Yes, indeed. You mean arrangements for the funeral. How horrible it
sounds! I can’t realize it yet. It is all so shocking and so sudden
and unlooked-for. It seems like some dreadful dream.”

“Well, Barbara,” I said gently, “you shan’t be troubled more than is
unavoidable. I will see to all the domestic affairs and leave the
legal business to Brodribb. But I shall want Wallingford’s help, and I
think I had better go down and see him now.”

“Very well, Rupert,” she replied with a sigh. “I shall lean on you now
as I always have done in times of trouble and difficulty, and you must
try to imagine how grateful I am since I can find no words to tell
you.”

She pressed my hand and released me, and I took my way down to the
library with a strong distaste for my mission.

That distaste was not lessened when I opened the door and was met by a
reek of cigarette smoke. Wallingford was sitting huddled up in an easy
chair, but as I entered, he sprang to his feet and stood facing me
with a sort of hostile apprehensiveness. The man was certainly
unstrung; in fact he was on wires. His pale, haggard face twitched,
his hands trembled visibly and his limbs were in constant, fidgety
movement. But, to me, there seemed to be no mystery about his
condition. The deep yellow stains on his fingers, the reek in the air
and a pile of cigarette-ends in an ash-bowl were enough to account for
a good deal of nervous derangement, even if there were nothing more—no
drugs or drink.

I opened the business quietly, explaining what had to be done and what
help I should require from him. At first he showed a tendency to
dispute my authority and treat me as an outsider, but I soon made the
position and powers of an executor clear to him. When I had brought
him to heel I gave him a set of written instructions the following-out
of which would keep him fairly busy for the rest of the day; and
having set the dismal preparations going, I went forth from the house
of mourning and took my way to New Square, Lincoln’s Inn, where were
the offices of Mr. Brodribb, the family solicitor and my co-executor.



Chapter III

A Shock for the Mourners

It was on the day of the funeral that the faint, unheeded mutterings
of the approaching storm began to swell into audible and threatening
rumblings, though, even then, the ominous signs failed to deliver
their full significance.

How well do I recall the scene in the darkened dining room where we
sat in our sable raiment, “ready to wenden on our pilgrimage” to the
place of everlasting rest and eternal farewell. There were but four of
us, for Amos Monkhouse had not yet arrived, though it was within a few
minutes of the appointed time to start; quite a small party; for the
deceased had but few relatives, and no outsiders had been bidden.

We were all rather silent. Intimate as we were, there was no need to
make conversation. Each, no doubt, was busy with his or her own
thoughts, and as I recall my own they seem to have been rather trivial
and not very suitable to the occasion. Now and again I stole a look at
Barbara and thought what a fine, handsome woman she was, and dimly
wondered why, in all the years that I had known her, I had never
fallen in love with her. Yet so it was. I had always admired her; we
had been intimate friends, with a certain amount of quiet affection,
but nothing more—at any rate on my part. Of her I was not so sure.
There had been a time, some years before, when I had had an uneasy
feeling that she looked to me for something more than friendship. But
she was always a reticent girl; very self-reliant and self-contained.
I never knew a woman better able to keep her own counsel or control
her emotions.

She was now quite herself again; quiet, dignified, rather reserved and
even a little inscrutable. Seated between Wallingford and Madeline,
she seemed unconscious of either and quite undisturbed by the
secretary’s incessant nervous fidgeting and by his ill-concealed
efforts to bring himself to her notice.

From Barbara my glance turned to the woman who sat by her side, noting
with dull interest the contrast between the two; a contrast as marked
in their bearing as in their appearance. For whereas Barbara was a
rather big woman, dark in colouring, quiet and resolute in manner,
Madeline Norris was somewhat small and slight, almost delicately fair,
rather shy and retiring, but yet with a suggestion of mental alertness
under the diffident manner. If Barbara gave an impression of quiet
strength, Madeline’s pretty, refined face was rather expressive of
subtle intelligence. But what chiefly impressed me at this moment was
the curious inversion of their attitudes towards the existing
circumstances; for whereas Barbara, the person mainly affected,
maintained a quiet, untroubled demeanour, Madeline appeared to be
overcome by the sudden catastrophe. Looking at her set, white face and
the dismay in her wide, grey eyes, and comparing her with the woman at
her side, a stranger would at once have assumed the bereavement to be
hers.

My observations were interrupted by Wallingford once more dragging out
his watch.

“What on earth can have happened to Mr. Amos?” he exclaimed. “We are
due to start in three minutes. If he isn’t here by then we shall have
to start without him. It is perfectly scandalous! Positively indecent!
But there, it’s just like a parson.”

“My experience of parsons,” said I, “is that they are, as a rule,
scrupulously punctual. But certainly, Mr. Amos is unpardonably late.
It will be very awkward if he doesn’t arrive in time. Ah, there he
is,” I added as the bell rang and a muffled knock at the street door
was heard.

At the sound, Wallingford sprang up as if the bell had actuated a
hidden spring in the chair, and darted over to the window, from which
he peered out through the chink beside the blind.

“It isn’t Amos,” he reported. “It’s a stranger, and a fool at that, I
should say, if he can’t see that all the blinds are down.”

We all listened intently. We heard the housemaid’s hurried footsteps,
though she ran on tip-toe; the door opened softly, and then, after an
interval, we heard some one ushered along the hall to the drawing
room. A few moments later, Mabel entered with an obviously scandalized
air.

“A gentleman wishes to speak to you, Ma’am,” she announced.

“But, Mabel,” said Barbara, “did you tell him what is happening in
this house?”

“Yes, Ma’am, I explained exactly how things were and told him that he
must call to-morrow. But he said that his business was urgent and that
he must see you at once.”

“Very well,” said Barbara. “I will go and see what he wants. But it is
very extraordinary.”

She rose, and nearly colliding with Wallingford, who had rushed to
open the door—which was, in fact, wide open—walked out quickly,
closing the door after her. After a short interval—during which
Wallingford paced the room excitedly, peered out of the window, sat
down, got up again and looked at his watch—she came back, and,
standing in the doorway, looked at me.

“Would you come here for a minute, Rupert,” she said, quietly.

I rose at once and walked back with her to the drawing room, on
entering which I became aware of a large man, standing monumentally on
the hearth-rug and inspecting the interior of his hat. He looked to me
like a plainclothes policeman, and my surmise was verified by a
printed card which he presented and which bore the inscription
“Sergeant J. Burton.”

“I am acting as coroner’s officer,” he explained in reply to my
interrogatory glance, “and I have come to notify you that the funeral
will have to be postponed as the coroner has decided to hold an
inquest. I have seen the undertakers and explained matters to them.”

“Do you know what reason there is for an inquest?” I asked. “The cause
of death was certified in the regular way.”

“I know nothing beyond my instructions, which were to notify Mrs.
Monkhouse that the funeral is put off and to serve the summonses for
the witnesses. I may as well do that now.”

With this he laid on the table six small blue papers, which I saw were
addressed respectively to Barbara, Madeline, Wallingford, the
housemaid, the cook and myself.

“Have you no idea at all why an inquest is to be held?” I asked as I
gathered up the papers.

“I have no information,” he replied, cautiously, “but I expect there
is some doubt about the exact cause of death. The certificate may not
be quite clear or it may be that some interested party has
communicated with the coroner. That is what usually happens, you know,
Sir. But at any rate,” he added, cheerfully, “you will know all about
it the day after to-morrow, which, you will observe, is the day fixed
for the inquest.”

“And what have we to do meanwhile?” Barbara asked. “The inquest will
not be held in this house, I presume.”

“Certainly not, Madam,” the sergeant replied. “A hearse will be sent
round to-night to remove the body to the mortuary, where the post
mortem examination will be carried out, and the inquest will be held
in the parish hall, as is stated on the summons. I am sorry that you
should be put to this inconvenience,” he concluded, moving tentatively
towards the door, “but—er—it couldn’t be helped, I suppose. Good
morning, Madam.”

I walked with him to the door and let him out, while Barbara waited
for me in the hall, not unobserved by Wallingford, whose eye appeared
in a chink beside the slightly open dining room door. I pointedly led
her back into the drawing room and closed the door audibly behind us.
She turned a pale and rather shocked face to me but she spoke quite
composedly as she asked:

“What do you make of it, Rupert? Is it Amos?”

I had already reluctantly decided that it must be. I say, reluctantly,
because, if this were really his doing, the resigned tone of his last
words to me would appear no less than sheer, gross hypocrisy.

“I don’t know who else it could be,” I answered. “The fact that he did
not come this morning suggests that he at least knew what was
happening. If he did, I think he might have warned us.”

“Yes, indeed. It will be a horrid scandal; most unpleasant for us all,
and especially for me. Not that I am entitled to any sympathy. Poor
Harold! How he would have hated the thought of a public fuss over his
dead body. I suppose we must go in now and tell the others. Do you
mind telling them, Rupert?”

We crossed the hall to the dining room where we found the two waiting
impatiently, Madeline very pale and agitated while Wallingford was
pacing the room like a wild beast. Both looked at us with eager
interrogation as we entered, and I made the announcement bluntly and
in a dozen words.

The effect on both was electrical. Madeline, with a little cry of
horror, sank, white-faced and trembling, into a chair. As for
Wallingford, his behaviour was positively maniacal. After staring at
me for a few moments with starting eyes and mouth agape, he flung up
his arms and uttered a hoarse shout.

“This,” he yelled, “is the doing of that accursed parson! Now we know
why he kept out of the way—and it is well for him that he did!”

He clenched his fists and glared around him, showing his
tobacco-stained teeth in a furious snarl while the sweat gathered in
beads on his livid face. Then, suddenly, his mood changed and he
dropped heavily on a chair, burying his face in his shaking hands.
Barbara admonished him, quietly.

“Do try to be calm, Tony. There is nothing to get so excited about. It
is all very unpleasant and humiliating, of course, but at any rate you
are not affected. It is I who will be called to account.”

“And do you suppose that doesn’t affect me?” demanded Wallingford, now
almost on the verge of tears.

“I am sure it does, Tony,” she replied, gently, “but if you want to be
helpful to me you will try to be calm and reasonable. Come, now,” she
added, persuasively, “let us put it away for the present. I must tell
the servants. Then we had better have lunch and go our several ways to
think the matter over quietly each of us alone. We shall only agitate
one another if we remain together.”

I agreed emphatically with this sensible suggestion. “Not,” I added,
“that there is much for us to think over. The explanations will have
to come from Dimsdale. It was he who failed to grasp the seriousness
of poor Harold’s condition.”

While Barbara was absent, breaking the news to the servants, I tried
to bring Madeline to a more composed frame of mind. With Wallingford I
had no patience. Men should leave hysterics to the other sex. But I
was sorry for Madeline; and even if she seemed more overwhelmed by the
sudden complications than the occasion justified, I told myself that
the blow had fallen when she was already shaken by Harold’s unexpected
death.

The luncheon was a silent and comfortless function; indeed it was
little more than an empty form. But it had the merit of brevity. When
the last dish had been sent away almost intact, Wallingford drew out
his cigarette case and we all rose.

“What are you going to do, Madeline?” Barbara asked.

“I must go to the school, I suppose, and let the secretary know
that—that I may have to be absent for a day or two. It will be horrid.
I shall have to tell him all about it—after having got leave for the
funeral. But it will sound so strange, so extraordinary. Oh! It is
horrible!”

“It is!” exclaimed Wallingford, fumbling with tremulous fingers at his
cigarette case. “It is diabolical! A fiendish plot to disgrace and
humiliate us. As to that infernal parson, I should like—”

“Never mind that, Tony,” said Barbara; “and we had better not stay
here, working up one another’s emotions. What are you doing, Rupert?”

“I shall go to my chambers and clear off some correspondence.”

“Then you might walk part of the way with Madeline and see if you
can’t make her mind a little more easy.”

Madeline looked at me eagerly. “Will you, Rupert?” she asked.

Of course I assented, and a few minutes later we set forth together.

For a while she walked by my side in silence with an air of deep
reflection, and I refrained from interrupting her thoughts, having no
very clear idea as to what I should say to her. Moreover, my own mind
was pretty busily occupied. Presently she spoke, in a tentative way,
as if opening a discussion.

“I am afraid you must think me very weak and silly to be so much upset
by this new trouble.”

“Indeed, I don’t,” I replied. “It is a most disturbing and humiliating
affair and it will be intensely unpleasant for us all, but especially
for Barbara—to say nothing of Dimsdale.”

“Dr. Dimsdale is not our concern,” said she, “but it will be perfectly
horrible for Barbara. For she really has been rather casual, poor
girl, and they are sure to make things unpleasant for her. It will be
a most horrid scandal. Don’t you think so?”

To be candid, I did. Indeed, I had just been picturing to myself the
possibilities with an officious coroner—and he would not need to be so
very officious, either—and one or two cross-grained jurymen. Barbara
might be subjected to a very unpleasant examination. But I did not
think it necessary to say this to Madeline. Sufficient for the day is
the evil thereof. I contented myself with a vague agreement.

There was another interval of silence. Then, a little to my surprise,
she drew closer to me, and, slipping her hand under my arm, said very
earnestly: “Rupert, I want you to tell me what you really think. What
is it all about?”

I looked down, rather disconcerted, into the face that was turned up
to me so appealingly; and suddenly—and rather irrelevantly—it was
borne in on me that it was a singularly sweet and charming face. I had
never quite realized it before. But then she had never before looked
at me quite in this way; with this trustful, coaxing, appealing
expression.

“I don’t quite understand you, Madeline,” I said, evasively. “I know
no more about it than you do.”

“Oh, but you do, Rupert. You are a lawyer and you have had a lot of
experience. You must have formed some opinion as to why they have
decided to hold an inquest. Do tell me what you think.”

The coaxing, almost wheedling tone, and the entreaty in her eyes,
looking so earnestly into mine, nearly conquered my reserve. But not
quite. Once more I temporized.

“Well, Madeline, we all realize that what Dimsdale has written on the
certificate is little more than a guess, and quite possibly wrong; and
even Detling couldn’t get much farther.”

“Yes, I realize that. But I didn’t think that inquests were held just
to find out whether the doctors’ opinions were correct or not.”

Of course she was perfectly right; and I now perceived that her
thoughts had been travelling along the same lines as my own. An
inquest would not be held merely to clear up an obscure diagnosis.
There was certainly something more behind this affair than Dimsdale’s
failure to recognize the exact nature of the illness. There was only
one simple explanation of the coroner’s action, and I gave it—with a
strong suspicion that it was not the right one.

“They are not, as a rule, excepting in hospitals. But this is a
special case. Amos Monkhouse was obviously dissatisfied with Dimsdale,
and with Barbara, too. He may have challenged the death certificate
and asked for an inquest. The coroner would be hardly likely to
refuse, especially if there were a hint of negligence or malpractice.”

“Did Mr. Amos say anything to you that makes you think he may have
challenged the certificate?”

“He said very little to me at all,” I replied, rather casuistically
and suppressing the fact that Amos had explicitly accepted the actual
circumstances and deprecated any kind of recrimination.

“I can hardly believe that he would have done it,” said Madeline,
“just to punish Barbara and Dr. Dimsdale. It would be so vindictive,
especially for a clergyman.”

“Clergymen are very human sometimes,” I rejoined; and, as, rather to
my relief, we now came in sight of Madeline’s destination, I adverted
to the interview which she seemed to dread so much. “There is no
occasion for you to go into details with the secretary,” I said. “In
fact you can’t. The exact cause of death was not clear to the doctors
and it has been considered advisable to hold an inquest. That is all
you know, and it is enough. You are summoned as a witness and you are
legally bound to attend, so you are asking no favour. Cut the
interview dead short, and when you have done with it, try, like a
sensible girl, to forget the inquest for the present. I shall come
over to-morrow and then we can reconstitute the history of the case,
so that we may go into the witness-box, or its equivalent, with a
clear idea of what we have to tell. And now, good-bye, or rather au
revoir!”

“Good-bye, Rupert.” She took my proffered hand and held it as she
thanked me for walking with her. “Do you know, Rupert,” she added,
“there is something strangely comforting and reassuring about you. We
all feel it. You seem to carry an atmosphere of quiet strength and
security. I don’t wonder that Barbara is so fond of you. Not,” she
concluded, “that she holds a monopoly.”

With this she let go my hand, and, with a slightly shy smile and the
faintest suspicion of a blush, turned away and walked quickly and with
an air quite cheerful and composed towards the gateway of the
institution. Apparently, my society had had a beneficial effect on her
nervous condition.

I watched her until she disappeared into the entry, and then resumed
my journey eastward, rather relieved, I fear, at having disposed of my
companion. For I wanted to think—of her among other matters; and it
was she who first occupied my cogitations. The change from her usual
matter-of-fact friendliness had rather taken me by surprise; and I had
to admit that it was not a disagreeable surprise. But what was the
explanation? Was this intimate, clinging manner merely a passing phase
due to an emotional upset, or was it that the special circumstances
had allowed feelings hitherto concealed to come to the surface? It was
an interesting question, but one that time alone could answer; and as
there were other questions, equally interesting and more urgent, I
consigned this one to the future and turned to consider the others.

What could be the meaning of this inquest? The supposition that Amos
had suddenly turned vindictive and resolved to expose the neglect, to
which he probably attributed his brother’s death, I could not
entertain, especially after what he had said to me. It would have
written him down the rankest of hypocrites. And yet he was in some way
connected with the affair as was proved by his failure to appear at
the funeral. As to the idea that the inquiry was merely to elucidate
the nature of the illness, that was quite untenable. A private autopsy
would have been the proper procedure for that purpose.

I was still turning the question over in my mind when, as I passed the
Griffin at Temple Bar, I became aware of a tall figure some distance
ahead walking in the same direction. The build of the man and his
long, swinging stride seemed familiar. I looked at him more
attentively; and just as he turned to enter Devereux Court I
recognized him definitely as a fellow Templar named Thorndyke.

The chance encounter seemed a singularly fortunate one, and at once I
quickened my pace to overtake him. For Dr. Thorndyke was a medical
barrister and admittedly the greatest living authority on medical
jurisprudence. The whole subject of inquests and Coroners’ Law was an
open book to him. But he was not only a lawyer. He had, I understood,
a professional and very thorough knowledge of pathology and of the
science of medicine in general, so that he was the very man to
enlighten me in my present difficulties.

I overtook him at the Little Gate of the Middle Temple and we walked
through together into New Court. I wasted no time, but, after the
preliminary greetings, asked him if he had a few minutes to spare. He
replied, in his quiet, genial way: “But, of course, Mayfield. I always
have a few minutes to spare for a friend and a colleague.”

I thanked him for the gracious reply, and, as we slowly descended the
steps and sauntered across Fountain Court, I opened the matter without
preamble and gave him a condensed summary of the case; to which he
listened with close attention and evidently with keen interest.

“I am afraid,” he said, “that your family doctor will cut rather a
poor figure. He seems to have mismanaged the case rather badly, to
judge by the fact that the death of the patient took him quite by
surprise. By the way, can you give me any idea of the symptoms—as
observed by yourself, I mean?”

“I have told you what was on the certificate.”

“Yes. But the certified cause of death appears to be contested. You
saw the patient pretty often, I understand. Now what sort of
appearance did he present to you?”

The question rather surprised me. Dimsdale’s opinion might not be
worth much, but the casual and inexpert observations of a layman would
have seemed to me to be worth nothing at all. However, I tried to
recall such details as I could remember of poor Monkhouse’s appearance
and his own comments on his condition and recounted them to Thorndyke
with such amplifications as his questions elicited. “But,” I
concluded, “the real question is, who has set the coroner in motion
and with what object?”

“That question,” said Thorndyke, “will be answered the day after
to-morrow, and there is not much utility in trying to guess at the
answer in advance. The real question is whether any arrangements ought
to be made in the interests of your friends. We are quite in the dark
as to what may occur in the course of the inquest.”

“Yes, I had thought of that. Some one ought to be present to represent
Mrs. Monkhouse. I suppose it would not be possible for you to attend
to watch the case on her behalf?”

“I don’t think it would be advisable,” he replied. “You will be
present and could claim to represent Mrs. Monkhouse so far as might be
necessary to prevent improper questions being put to her. But I do
think that you should have a complete record of all that takes place.
I would suggest that I send Holman, who does most of my shorthand
reporting, with instructions to make a verbatim report of the entire
proceedings. It may turn out to be quite unnecessary; but if any
complications should arise, we shall have the complete depositions
with the added advantage that you will have been present and will have
heard all the evidence. How will that suit you?”

“If you think it is the best plan there is nothing more to say,
excepting to thank you for your help.”

“And give me a written note of the time and place to hand to Holman
when I give him his instructions.”

I complied with this request at once; and having by this time reached
the end of the Terrace, I shook hands with him and walked slowly back
to my chambers in Fig Tree Court. I had not got much out of Thorndyke
excepting a very useful suggestion and some valuable help; indeed, as
I turned over his extremely cautious utterances and speculated on what
he meant by “complications,” I found myself rather more uncomfortably
puzzled than I had been before I met him.



Chapter IV

“How, When and Where—”

It was on the second day after the interrupted funeral that the
thunderbolt fell. I cannot say that it found me entirely unprepared,
for my reflections during the intervening day had filled me with
forebodings; and by Thorndyke the catastrophe was pretty plainly
foreseen. But on the others the blow fell with devastating effect.
However, I must not anticipate. Rather let me get back to a
consecutive narration of the actual events.

On the day after the visit of the coroner’s officer we had held, at my
suggestion, a sort of family committee to consider what we knew of the
circumstances and antecedents of Harold’s death, so that we might be
in a position to give our evidence clearly and readily and be in
agreement as to the leading facts. Thus we went to the coroner’s court
prepared, at least, to tell an intelligible and consistent story.

As soon as I entered the large room in which the inquest was to be
held, my forebodings deepened. The row of expectant reporters was such
as one does not find where the proceedings are to be no more than a
simple, routine inquiry. Something of public interest was anticipated,
and these gentlemen of the Press had received a hint from some
well-informed quarter. I ran my eye along the row and was somewhat
relieved to observe Mr. Holman, Thorndyke’s private reporter, seated
at the table with a large note-book and a half-dozen well-sharpened
pencils before him. His presence—as, in a sense, Thorndyke’s
deputy—gave me the reassuring feeling that, if there were to be
“complications,” I should not have to meet them with my own limited
knowledge and experience, but that there were reserves of special
knowledge and weighty counsel on which I could fall back.

The coroner’s manner seemed to me ominous. His introductory address to
the jury was curt and ambiguous, setting forth no more than the name
of the deceased and the fact that circumstances had seemed to render
an inquiry advisable; and having said this, he proceeded forthwith
(the jury having already viewed the body) to call the first witness,
the Reverend Amos Monkhouse.

I need not repeat the clergyman’s evidence in detail. When he had
identified the body as that of his brother, Harold, he went on to
relate the events which I have recorded: his visit to his sick
brother, his alarm at the patient’s appearance, his call upon Dr.
Dimsdale and his subsequent interview with Sir Robert Detling. It was
all told in a very concise, matter-of-fact manner, and I noted that
the coroner did not seek to amplify the condensed statement by any
questions.

“At about nine o’clock in the morning of the 13th,” the witness
continued, “I received a telegram from Miss Norris informing me that
my brother had died in the night. I went out at once and sent a
telegram to Sir Robert Detling informing him of what had happened. I
then went to number 16 Hilborough Square, where I saw the body of
deceased lying in his bed quite cold and stiff. I saw nobody at the
house excepting the housemaid and Mr. Mayfield. After leaving the
house I walked about the streets for several hours and did not return
to my hotel until late in the afternoon. When I arrived there, I found
awaiting me a telegram from Sir Robert Detling asking me to call on
him without delay. I set forth at once and arrived at Sir Robert’s
house at half-past five, and was shown into his study immediately. Sir
Robert then told me that he had come to the conclusion that the
circumstances of my brother’s death called for some investigation and
that he proposed to communicate with the coroner. He urged me not to
raise any objections and advised me to say nothing to any one but to
wait until the coroner’s decision was made known. I asked him for his
reasons for communicating with the coroner, but he said that he would
rather not make any statement. I heard no more until the morning of
the fifteenth, the day appointed for the funeral, when the coroner’s
officer called at my hotel to inform me that the funeral would not
take place and to serve the summons for my attendance here as a
witness.”

When Amos had concluded his statement, the coroner glanced at the
jury, and as no one offered to put any questions, he dismissed the
witness and called the next—Mabel Withers—who, at once, came forward
to the table. Having been sworn and having given her name, the witness
deposed that she had been housemaid to deceased and that it was she
who had discovered the fact of his death, relating the circumstances
in much the same words as I have recorded. When she had finished her
narrative, the coroner said: “You have told us that the candle in the
deceased’s lamp was completely burnt out. Do you happen to know how
long one of those candles would burn?”

“Yes. About four hours.”

“When did you last see deceased alive?”

“At half-past ten on Tuesday night, the twelfth. I looked in at his
room on my way up to bed to see if he wanted anything, and I gave him
a dose of medicine.”

“What was his condition then?”

“He looked very ill, but he seemed fairly comfortable. He had a book
in his hand but was not reading.”

“Was the candle alight then?”

“No, the gas was alight. I asked him if I should turn it out but he
said ‘no.’ He would wait until Miss Norris or Mr. Wallingford came.”

“Did you notice how much candle there was in the lamp then?”

“There was a whole candle. I put it in myself in the afternoon and it
had not been lit. He used to read by the gas as long as it was alight.
He only used the candle-lamp if he couldn’t sleep and the gas was
out.”

“Could you form any opinion as to how long the candle had been burnt
out?”

“It must have been out some time, for there was no smell in the room
as there would have been if it had only been out a short time. The
window was hardly open at all; only just a small crack.”

“Do you know when deceased last took food?”

“Yes, he had his supper at eight o’clock; an omelette and a tiny piece
of toast with a glass of milk.”

“Who cooked the omelette?”

“Miss Norris.”

“Why did Miss Norris cook it? Was the cook out?”

“No. But Miss Norris usually cooked his supper and sometimes made
little dishes for his lunch. She is a very expert cook.”

“Who took the omelette up to deceased?”

“Miss Norris. I asked if I should take his supper up, but she said she
was going up and would take it herself.”

“Was any one else present when Miss Norris was cooking the omelette?”

“Yes, I was present and so was the cook.”

“Did deceased usually have the same food as the rest of the
household?”

“No, he usually had his own special diet.”

“Who prepared his food, as a rule?”

“Sometimes the cook, but more often Miss Norris.”

“Now, with regard to his medicine. Did deceased usually take it
himself?”

“No, he didn’t like to have the bottle on the bedside table, as it was
rather crowded with his books and things. The bottle and the
medicine-glass were kept on the mantelpiece and the medicine was given
to him by whoever happened to be in the room when a dose was due.
Sometimes I gave it to him; at other times Mrs. Monkhouse or Miss
Norris or Mr. Wallingford.”

“Do you remember when the last bottle of medicine came?”

“Yes. It came early in the afternoon of the day before he died. I took
it in and carried it up at once.”

When he had written down this answer, the coroner ran his eye through
his previous notes and then glanced at the jury.

“Do any of you gentlemen wish to ask the witness any questions?” he
enquired; and as no one answered, he dismissed the witness with the
request that she would stay in the court in case any further testimony
should be required of her. He then announced that he would take the
evidence of Sir Robert Detling next in order to release him for his
probably numerous engagements. Sir Robert’s name was accordingly
called and a grave-looking, elderly gentleman rose from near the
doorway and walked up to the table. When the new witness had been
sworn and the formal preliminaries disposed of, the coroner said:

“I will ask you, Sir Robert, to give the jury an account of the
circumstances which led to your making a certain communication to me.”

Sir Robert bowed gravely and proceeded at once to make his statement
in the clear, precise manner of a practised speaker.

“On Friday, the 8th instant, the Reverend Amos Monkhouse called on me
to arrange a consultation with Dr. Dimsdale who was in attendance on
his brother, the deceased. I met Dr. Dimsdale by appointment the
following afternoon, the 9th, and with him made a careful examination
of deceased. I was extremely puzzled by the patient’s condition. He
was obviously very seriously—I thought, dangerously—ill, but I was
unable to discover any signs or symptoms that satisfactorily accounted
for his grave general condition. I could not give his disease a name.
Eventually, I took a number of blood-films and some specimens of the
secretions to submit to a pathologist for examination and to have them
tested for micro-organisms. I took them that night to Professor
Garnett’s laboratory, but the professor was unfortunately absent and
not returning until the following night—Sunday. I therefore kept them
until Sunday night when I took them to him and asked him to examine
them with as little delay as possible. He reported on the following
day that microscopical examination had not brought to light anything
abnormal, but he was making cultures from the secretions and would
report the result on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday morning at about
half-past nine, I received a telegram from the Reverend Amos Monkhouse
informing me that his brother had died during the night. A few minutes
later, a messenger brought Professor Garnett’s report; which was to
the effect that no disease-bearing organisms had been found, nor
anything abnormal excepting a rather singular scarcity of
micro-organisms of any kind.

“This fact, together with the death of the patient, suddenly aroused
my suspicions. For the absence of the ordinary micro-organisms
suggested the presence of some foreign chemical substance. And now, as
I recalled the patient’s symptoms, I found them consistent with the
presence in the body of some foreign substance. Instantly, I made my
way to Professor Garnett’s laboratory and communicated my suspicions
to him. I found that he shared them and had carefully preserved the
remainder of the material for further examination. We both suspected
the presence of a foreign substance, and we both suspected it to be
arsenic.

“The professor had at hand the means of making a chemical test, so we
proceeded at once to use them. The test that we employed was the one
known as Reinsch’s test. The result showed a very appreciable amount
of arsenic in the secretions tested. On this, I sealed up what was
left of the specimens, and, after notifying Mr. Monkhouse of my
intention, reported the circumstances to the coroner.”

When Sir Robert ceased speaking, the coroner bowed, and having written
down the last words, reflected for a few moments. Then he turned to
the jury and said: “I don’t think we need detain Sir Robert any longer
unless there are any questions that you would like to ask.”

At this point the usual over-intelligent juryman interposed.

“We should like to know whether the vessels in which the specimens
were contained were perfectly clean and free from chemicals.”

“The bottles,” Sir Robert replied, “were clean in the ordinary sense.
I rinsed them out with clean water before introducing the material.
But, of course, they could not be guaranteed to be chemically clean.”

“Then doesn’t that invalidate the analysis?” the juror asked.

“It was hardly an analysis,” the witness replied. “It was just a
preliminary test.”

“The point which you are raising, Sir,” said the coroner, “is quite a
sound one but it is not relevant to this inquiry. Sir Robert’s test
was made to ascertain if an inquiry was necessary. He decided that it
was, and we are now holding that inquiry. You will not form your
verdict on the results of Sir Robert’s test but on those of the post
mortem examination and the special analysis that has been made.”

This explanation appeared to satisfy the juror and Sir Robert was
allowed to depart. The coroner once more seemed to consider awhile and
then addressed the jury.

“I think it will be best to take next the evidence relating to the
examination of the body. When you have heard that you will be better
able to weigh the significance of what the other witnesses have to
tell us. We will now take the evidence of Dr. Randall.”

As the new witness, a small, dry, eminently professional-looking man,
stepped briskly up to the table, I stole a quick, rather furtive
glance at my companions and saw my own alarm plainly reflected in
their faces and bearing. Barbara, on my left hand, sat up stiffly,
rigid as a statue, her face pale and set, but quite composed, her eyes
fixed on the man who was about to be sworn. Madeline, on my right, was
ghastly. But she, too, was still and quiet, sitting with her hands
tightly clasped, as if to restrain or conceal their trembling, and her
eyes bent on the floor. As to Wallingford, who sat on the other side
of Barbara, I could not see his face, but by his foot, which I could
see and hear, tapping quickly on the floor as if he were working a
spinning-wheel, and his incessantly moving hands, I judged that his
nerves were at full tension.

The new witness deposed that his name was Walter Randall, that he was
a Bachelor of Medicine and police surgeon of the district and that he
had made a careful examination of the body of deceased and that, with
Dr. Barnes, he had made an analysis of certain parts of that body.

“To anticipate a little,” said the coroner, “did you arrive at an
opinion as to the cause of death?”

“Yes. From the post mortem examination and the analysis taken
together, I came to the conclusion that deceased died from the effects
of arsenic poisoning.”

“Have you any doubt that arsenic poisoning was really the cause of the
deceased’s death?”

“No, I have no doubt whatever.”

The reply, uttered with quiet decision, elicited a low murmur from the
jury and the few spectators, amidst which I heard Madeline gasp in a
choking whisper, “Oh! God!” and even Barbara was moved to a low cry of
horror. But I did not dare to look at either of them. As for me, the
blow had fallen already. Sir Robert’s evidence had told me all.

“You said,” the coroner resumed, “that the post mortem and the
analysis, taken together, led you to this conclusion. What did you
mean by that?”

“I meant that the appearance of the internal organs, taken alone,
would not have been conclusive. The conditions that I found were
suggestive of arsenic poisoning but might possibly have been due to
disease. It was only the ascertained presence of arsenic that
converted the probability into certainty.”

“You are quite sure that the conditions were not due to disease?”

“Not entirely. I would rather say that the effects of arsenical
poisoning were added to and mingled with those of old-standing
disease.”

“Would you tell us briefly what abnormal conditions you found?”

“The most important were those in the stomach, which showed marked
signs of inflammation.”

“You are aware that the death certificate gives old-standing chronic
gastritis as one of the causes of death?”

“Yes, and I think correctly. The arsenical gastritis was engrafted on
an already existing chronic gastritis. That is what made the
appearances rather difficult to interpret, especially as the post
mortem appearances in arsenical poisoning are extraordinarily
variable.”

“What else did you find?”

“There were no other conditions that were directly associated with the
poison. The heart was rather fatty and dilated, and its condition
probably accounts for the sudden collapse which seems to have
occurred.”

“Does not collapse usually occur in poisoning by arsenic?”

“Eventually it does, but it is usually the last of a long train of
symptoms. In some cases, however, collapse occurs quite early and may
carry the victim off at once. That is what appears from the
housemaid’s evidence to have happened in this case. Death seems to
have been sudden and almost peaceful.”

“Were there any other signs of disease?”

“Yes, the lungs were affected. There were signs of considerable
bronchial catarrh, but I do not regard this as having any connection
with the effects of the poison. It appeared to be an old-standing
condition.”

“Yes,” said the coroner. “The certificate mentions chronic bronchial
catarrh of several years’ standing. Did you find any arsenic in the
stomach?”

“Not in the solid form and only a little more than a hundredth of a
grain altogether. The stomach was practically empty. The other organs
were practically free from disease, excepting, perhaps, the kidneys,
which were congested but not organically diseased.”

“And as to the amount of arsenic present?”

“The analysis was necessarily a rather hasty one and probably shows
less than the actual quantity; but we found, as I have said, just over
a hundredth of a grain in the stomach, one and a half grains in the
liver, nearly a fifth of a grain in the kidneys and small quantities,
amounting in all to two grains, in the blood and tissues. The total
amount actually found was thus a little over three and a half grains—a
lethal dose.”

“What is the fatal dose of arsenic?”

“Two grains may prove fatal if taken in solution, as it appears to
have been in this case. Two and a half grains, in a couple of ounces
of fly-paper water, killed a strong, healthy girl of nineteen in
thirty-six hours.”

“And how long does a poisonous dose take to produce death?”

“The shortest period recorded is twenty minutes, the longest, over
three weeks.”

“Did you come to any general conclusion as to how long deceased had
been suffering from the effects of arsenic and as to the manner in
which it had been administered?”

“From the distribution of the poison in the organs and tissues and
from the appearance of the body, I inferred that the administration of
arsenic had been going on for a considerable time. There were signs of
chronic poisoning which led me to believe that for quite a long
time—perhaps months—deceased had been taking repeated small doses of
the poison, and that the final dose took such rapid effect by reason
of the enfeebled state of the deceased at the time when it was
administered.”

“And as to the mode of administration? Did you ascertain that?”

“In part, I ascertained it quite definitely. When the bearers went to
the house to fetch the body, I accompanied them and took the
opportunity to examine the bedroom. There I found on the mantelpiece a
bottle of medicine with the name of deceased on the label and brought
it away with me. It was an eight ounce bottle containing when full
eight doses, of which only one had been taken. Dr. Barnes and I,
together, analyzed the remaining seven ounces of the medicine and
obtained from it just over eleven grains of arsenic; that is a
fraction over a grain and a half in each ounce dose. The arsenic was
in solution and had been introduced into the medicine in the form of
the solution known officially as Liquor Arsenicalis, or Fowler’s
Solution.”

“That is perfectly definite,” said the coroner. “But you said that you
ascertained the mode of administration in part. Do you mean that you
inferred the existence of some other vehicle?”

“Yes. A single dose of this medicine contained only a grain and a half
of arsenic, which would hardly account for the effects produced or the
amount of arsenic which was found in the body. Of course, the
preceding dose from the other bottle may have contained the poison,
too, or it may have been taken in some other way.”

“What other way do you suggest?”

“I can merely suggest possibilities. A meal was taken about eight
o’clock. If that meal had contained a small quantity of arsenic—even a
single grain—that, added to what was in the medicine, would have been
enough to cause death. But there is no evidence whatever that the food
did contain arsenic.”

“If the previous dose of medicine had contained the same quantity of
the poison as the one that was last taken, would that account for the
death of deceased?”

“Yes. He would then have taken over three grains in four hours—more
than the minimum fatal dose.”

“Did you see the other—the empty medicine bottle?”

“No. I looked for it and should have taken possession of it, but it
was not there.”

“Is there anything else that you have to tell us concerning your
examination?”

“No, I think I have told you all I know about the case.”

The coroner cast an interrogatory glance at the jury, and when none of
them accepted the implied invitation, he released the witness and
named Dr. Barnes as his successor.

I need not record in detail the evidence of this witness. Having
deposed that he was a Doctor of Science and lecturer on Chemistry at
St. Martha’s Medical College, he proceeded to confirm Dr. Randall’s
evidence as to the analysis, giving somewhat fuller and more precise
details. He had been present at the autopsy, but he was not a
pathologist and was not competent to describe the condition of the
body. He had analyzed the contents of the medicine bottle with Dr.
Randall’s assistance and he confirmed the last witness’s statement as
to the quantity of arsenic found and the form in which it had been
introduced—Fowler’s Solution.

“What is the strength of Fowler’s Solution?”

“It contains four grains of arsenic—or, more strictly, of arsenious
acid—to the fluid ounce. So that, as the full bottle of medicine must
have contained just over twelve and a half grains of arsenious acid,
the quantity of Fowler’s Solution introduced must have been a little
over three fluid ounces; three point fourteen, to be exact.”

“You are confident that it was Fowler’s Solution that was used?”

“Yes; the chemical analysis showed that; but in addition, there was
the colour and the smell. Fowler’s Solution is coloured red with Red
Sandalwood and scented with Tincture of Lavender as a precaution
against accidents. Otherwise it would be colourless, odourless and
tasteless, like water.”

On the conclusion of Dr. Barnes’s evidence, the coroner remarked to
the jury: “I think we ought to be clear on the facts with regard to
this medicine. Let Mabel Withers be recalled.”

Once more the housemaid took her place by the table and the coroner
resumed the examination.

“You say that the last bottle of medicine came early in the afternoon.
Can you tell us the exact time?”

“It was about a quarter to three. I remember that because when I took
up the new bottle, I asked Mr. Monkhouse if he had had his medicine
and he said that his brother, Mr. Amos Monkhouse, had given him a dose
at two o’clock just before he left.”

“Did you open the fresh bottle?”

“I took off the paper wrapping and the cap but I didn’t take the cork
out.”

“Was the old bottle empty then?”

“No; there was one dose left in it. That would be due at six o’clock.”

“Do you know what became of the old bottle?”

“Yes. When I had given him his last dose—that was out of the new
bottle—I took the old bottle away and washed it at once.”

“Why did you wash the bottle?”

“The used medicine bottles were always washed and sent back to Dr.
Dimsdale.”

“Did you send back the corks, too?”

“No, the corks were usually burned in the rubbish destructor.”

“Do you know what happened to this particular cork?”

“I took it down with me in the morning and dropped it in the bin which
was kept for the rubbish to be taken out to the destructor. The cork
must have been burned with the other rubbish the same day.”

“When you gave deceased that last dose of medicine from the new
bottle, did you notice anything unusual about it? Any smell, for
instance?”

“I noticed a very faint smell of lavender. But that was not unusual.
His medicine often smelt of lavender.”

“Do you know if the previous bottle of medicine smelt of lavender?”

“Yes, it did. I noticed it when I was washing out the bottle.”

“That, gentlemen,” said the coroner, as he wrote down the answer, “is
a very important fact. You will notice that it bears out Dr. Randall’s
opinion that more than one dose of the poison had been given; that, in
fact, a number of repeated small doses had been administered. And, so
far as we can see at present, the medicine was, at least, the
principal medium of its administration. The next problem that we have
to solve is how the poison got into the medicine. If none of you wish
to put any questions to the very intelligent witness whom we have just
been examining, I think we had better call Dr. Dimsdale and hear what
he has to tell us.”

The jury had no questions to put to Mabel but were manifestly all agog
to hear Dr. Dimsdale’s evidence. The housemaid was accordingly sent
back to her seat, and the doctor stepped briskly—almost too briskly, I
thought—up to the table.



Chapter V

Madeline’s Ordeal

I was rather sorry for Dimsdale. His position was a very disagreeable
one and he fully realized it. His patient had been poisoned before his
very eyes and he had never suspected even grave illness. In a sense,
the death of Harold Monkhouse lay at his door and it was pretty
certain that every one present would hold him accountable for the
disaster. Indeed, it was likely that he would receive less than
justice. Those who judged him would hardly stop to reflect on the
extraordinary difficulties that beset a busy medical man whose patient
is being secretly poisoned; would fail to consider the immense number
of cases of illness presented to him in the course of years of
practice and the infinitely remote probability that any one of them is
a case of poison. The immense majority of doctors pass through the
whole of their professional lives without meeting with such a case;
and it is not surprising that when the infinitely rare contingency
arises, it nearly always takes the practitioner unawares. My own
amazement at this incredible horror tended to make me sympathetic
towards Dimsdale and it was with some relief that I noted the
courteous and considerate manner that the coroner adopted in dealing
with the new witness.

“I think,” the former observed, “that we had better, in the first
place, pursue our inquiries concerning the medicine. You have heard
the evidence of Dr. Randall and Dr. Barnes. This bottle of medicine,
before any was taken from it, contained twelve and a half grains of
arsenious acid, in the form of just over three fluid ounces of
Fowler’s Solution. Can you suggest any explanation of that fact?”

“No,” replied Dimsdale, “I cannot.”

“What should the bottle have contained? What was the composition of
the medicine?”

“The medicine was just a simple, very mild tonic and alternative. The
bottle contained twenty-four minims of Tincture of Nux Vomica, sixteen
minims of Liquor Arsenicalis, half a fluid ounce of Syrup of Bitter
Orange to cover the taste of the Nux Vomica and half an ounce of
Compound Tincture of Cardamoms. So that each dose contained three
minims of Tincture of Nux Vomica and two minims of Liquor
Arsenicalis.”

“Liquor Arsenicalis is another name for Fowler’s Solution I
understand?”

“Yes, it is the official name; the other is the popular name.”

“Who supplied this medicine?”

“It was supplied by me.”

“Do you usually supply your patients with medicine?”

“No. Only a few of my old patients who prefer to have their medicine
from me. Usually, I write prescriptions which my patients have made up
by chemists.”

“This bottle, then, was made up in your own dispensary?”

“Yes.”

“Now, I put it to you, Dr. Dimsdale: this medicine did actually
contain Fowler’s Solution, according to the prescription. Is it not
possible that some mistake may have occurred in the amount put into
the bottle?”

“No, it is quite impossible.”

“Why is it impossible?”

“Because I made up this particular bottle myself. As my dispenser is
not a qualified pharmacist, I always dispense, with my own hands, any
medicines containing poisons. All dangerous drugs are kept in a poison
cupboard under lock and key, and I carry the key on my private bunch.
This is the key, and as you see, the lock is a Yale lock.”

He held up the bunch with the little flat key separated, for the
coroner’s and the jurymen’s inspection.

“But,” said the coroner, “you have not made it clear that a mistake in
the quantity was impossible.”

“I was coming to that,” replied Dimsdale. “The poisons in the cupboard
are, of course, powerful drugs which are given only in small doses,
and a special measure-glass is kept in the cupboard to measure them.
This glass holds only two drachms—a hundred and twenty minims, that
is, a quarter of an ounce. Now, the analysts found in this bottle
three fluid ounces of Fowler’s Solution. But to measure out that
quantity, I should have had to fill the measure-glass twelve times!
That is impossible. No one could do such a thing as that
inadvertently, especially when he was dispensing poisons.

“But that is not all. The poison bottles are all quite small. The one
in which the Liquor Arsenicalis is kept is a four ounce bottle. It
happened that I had refilled it a few days previously and it was full
when I dispensed this medicine. Now, obviously, if I had put three
ounces of the Liquor into the medicine bottle, there would have
remained in the dispensing bottle only one ounce. But the dispensing
bottle is still practically full. I had occasion to use it this
morning and I found it full save for the few minims that had been
taken to make up the deceased’s medicine.

“And there is another point. This medicine was coloured a deepish pink
by the Tincture of Cardamoms. But if it had contained three ounces of
Fowler’s Solution in addition, it would have been a deep red of quite
a different character. But I clearly remember the appearance of the
bottle as it lay on the white paper when I was wrapping it up. It had
the delicate pink colour that is imparted by the cochineal in the
Tincture of Cardamoms.”

The coroner nodded as he wrote down the reply, and enquired:

“Would any of you, gentlemen, like to ask any questions concerning the
bottle of medicine?”

“We should like to know, Sir,” said the foreman, “whether this bottle
of medicine ever left the doctor’s hands before it was sent to
deceased?”

“No, it did not,” replied Dimsdale. “As the dispenser was absent, I
put up the bottle entirely myself. I put in the cork, wrote the label,
tied on the paper cap, wrapped the bottle up, sealed the wrapping,
addressed it and gave it to the boy to deliver.”

The foreman expressed himself as fully satisfied with this answer and
the coroner then resumed:

“Well, we seem to have disposed of the medicine so far as you are
concerned, Doctor. We will now go on to consider the condition of
deceased during the last few days. Did no suspicion of anything
abnormal ever occur to you?”

“No, I neither perceived nor suspected anything abnormal.”

“Is that not rather remarkable? I realize that poisoning would be the
last thing that you would be looking for or expecting. But when it
occurred, is it not a little strange that you did not recognize the
symptoms?”

“Not at all,” replied Dimsdale. “There was nothing to recognize. The
classical symptoms of arsenic poisoning were entirely absent. You will
remember that Sir Robert Detling had no more suspicion than I had.”

“What are the classical symptoms, as you call them, of arsenic
poisoning?”

“The recognized symptoms—which are present in the immense majority of
cases—are acute abdominal pain and tenderness, intense thirst, nausea,
vomiting and purging; the symptoms, in fact, of extreme irritation of
the stomach and intestines. But in the case of deceased, these
symptoms were entirely absent. There was, in my opinion, nothing
whatever in his appearance or symptoms to suggest arsenic poisoning.
His condition appeared in no way different from what I had known it to
be on several previous occasions; just a variation for the worse of
his ordinary ill-health.”

“You do not doubt that arsenic poisoning was really the cause of his
death?”

“The analysis seems to put the matter beyond question; otherwise—I
mean apart from the analysis—I would not have entertained the idea of
arsenic poisoning for a moment.”

“But you do not dispute the cause of death?”

“No. Arsenic is extraordinarily variable in its effects, as Dr.
Randall mentioned, both on the dead body and on the living. Very
anomalous cases of arsenic poisoning have been mistaken, during life,
for opium poisoning.”

The coroner wrote down the answer and having glanced over his notes,
asked:

“What was the condition of deceased when his wife went away from
home?”

“He was much better. In fact his health seemed to be improving so much
that I hoped he would soon be about again.”

“And how soon after his wife’s departure did his last attack begin?”

“I should hardly call it an attack. It was a gradual change for the
worse. Mrs. Monkhouse went away on the 29th of August. On the 2nd of
September deceased was not so well and was extremely depressed and
disappointed at the relapse. From that time his condition fluctuated,
sometimes a little better and sometimes not so well. On the 8th he
appeared rather seriously ill and was no better on the 9th, the day of
the consultation with Sir Robert Detling. After that he seemed to
improve a little, and the slight improvement was maintained up to the
12th. His death came, at least to me, as quite a surprise.”

“You spoke just now of several previous occasions on which attacks—or,
if you prefer it, relapses—of a similar kind occurred. Looking back on
those relapses by the light of what we now know, do you say that they
were quite similar, in respect of the symptoms, to the one which ended
in the death of deceased?”

“I should say they were identically similar. At any rate, I can recall
no difference.”

“Did any of them seem to be as severe as the fatal one?”

“Yes; in fact the last of them—which occurred in June—seemed to be
more severe, only that it was followed by improvement and recovery. I
have here the section of my card-index which relates to deceased. In
the entry dated June 19 you will see that I have noted the patient’s
unsatisfactory condition.”

He handed a small pack of index-cards to the coroner, who examined the
upper card intently and then, with a sudden raising of the eyebrows,
addressed the jury.

“I had better read out the entry. The card is headed ‘Harold
Monkhouse’ and this entry reads: ‘June 19. Patient very low and
feeble. No appetite. Considerable gastric discomfort and troublesome
cough. Pulse 90, small, thready. Heart sounds weak. Sending report to
Mrs. Monkhouse.’”

He laid the cards down on the table, and, looking fixedly at Dimsdale,
repeated: “‘Sending report to Mrs. Monkhouse!’ Where was Mrs.
Monkhouse?”

“Somewhere in Kent, I believe. I sent the report to the head-quarters
of the Women’s Freedom League in Knightrider Street, Maidstone, from
whence I supposed it would be forwarded to her.”

For some seconds after receiving this answer the coroner continued to
gaze steadily at the witness. At length he observed:

“This is a remarkable coincidence. Can you recall the condition of
deceased when Mrs. Monkhouse went away on that occasion?”

“Yes. I remember that he was in comparatively good health. In fact,
his improved condition furnished the opportunity for Mrs. Monkhouse to
make her visit to Maidstone.”

“Can you tell us how soon after her departure on that occasion the
relapse occurred?”

“I cannot say definitely, but my impression is that the change for the
worse began a few days after she went away. Perhaps I might be able to
judge by looking at my notes.”

The coroner handed him back the index-cards, which he looked through
rapidly. “Yes,” he said, at length, “here is an entry on June 11 of a
bottle of tonic medicine for Mrs. Monkhouse. So she must have been at
home on that date; and as it was a double-sized bottle, it was
probably for her to take away with her.”

“Then,” said the coroner, “it is clear that, on the last two
occasions, the deceased was comparatively well when his wife left
home, but had a serious relapse soon after she went away. Now, what of
the previous relapses?”

“I am afraid I cannot remember. I have an impression that Mrs.
Monkhouse was away from home when some of them occurred, but at this
distance of time, I cannot recollect clearly. Possibly Mrs. Monkhouse,
herself, may be able to remember.”

“Possibly,” the coroner agreed, rather drily, “but as the point is of
considerable importance, I should be glad if you would presently look
through your case-cards and see if you can glean any definite
information on the subject. Meanwhile we may pass on to one or two
other matters. First as to the medicine which you prescribed for
deceased; it contained, as you have told us, a certain amount of
Fowler’s Solution, and you considered deceased to be suffering from
chronic gastritis. Is Fowler’s Solution usually given in cases of
gastritis?”

“No. It is usually considered rather unsuitable. But deceased was very
tolerant of small doses of arsenic. I had often given it to him before
as a tonic and it had always seemed to agree with him. The dose was
extremely small—only two minims.”

“How long have you known deceased?”

“I have known, and attended him professionally about twenty years.”

“From your knowledge of him, should you say that he was a man who was
likely to make enemies?”

“Not at all. He was a kindly, just and generous man, amiable and
even-tempered; rather reserved and aloof; not very human, perhaps, and
somewhat self-contained and solitary. But I could not imagine him
making an enemy and, so far as I know, he never did.”

The coroner reflected awhile after writing down this answer and then
turned to the jury.

“Are there any questions that you wish to put to the witness,
gentlemen?”

The jury consulted together for a few moments, and the foreman then
replied:

“We should like to know, Sir, if possible, whether Mrs. Monkhouse was
or was not away from home when the previous relapses occurred.”

“I am afraid,” said Dimsdale, “that I cannot be more explicit as the
events occurred so long ago. The other witnesses—the members of the
household—would be much more likely to remember. And I would urge you
not to detain me from my professional duties longer than is absolutely
necessary.”

Hereupon a brief consultation took place between the coroner and the
jury, with the result that Dimsdale was allowed to go about his
business and Barbara was summoned to take his place. I had awaited
this stage of the proceedings with some uneasiness and was now rather
surprised and greatly relieved at the coroner’s manner towards her;
which was courteous and even sympathetic. Having expressed his and the
jury’s regret at having to trouble her in the very distressing
circumstances, he proceeded at once to clear off the preliminaries,
eliciting the facts that she was 32 years of age and had been married
a little over three years, and then said:

“Dr. Dimsdale has told us that on the occasion of the attack or
relapse in June last you were away from home, but he is not certain
about the previous ones. Can you give us any information on the
subject?”

“Yes,” she replied, in a quiet, steady voice, “I recall quite clearly
at least three previous occasions on which I went away from home
leaving my husband apparently well—as well as he ever was—and came
back to find him quite ill. But I think there were more than three
occasions on which this happened, for I remember having once accused
him, facetiously, of saving up his illnesses until I was out of the
house.”

“Can you remember if a serious relapse ever occurred when you were at
home?”

“Not a really serious one. My husband’s health was always very
unstable and he often had to rest in bed for a day or two. But the
really bad attacks of illness seem always to have occurred when I was
away from home.”

“Did it never strike you that this was a very remarkable fact?”

“I am afraid I did not give the matter as much consideration as I
ought to have done. Deceased was always ailing, more or less, and
those about him came to accept his ill-health as his normal
condition.”

“But you see the significance of it now?”

Barbara hesitated and then replied in a low voice and with evident
agitation:

“I see that it may have some significance, but I don’t in the least
understand it. I am quite overwhelmed and bewildered by the dreadful
thing that has happened.”

“Naturally, you are,” the coroner said in a sympathetic tone, “and I
am most reluctant to trouble you with questions under circumstances
that must be so terrible to you. But we must find out the truth if we
can.”

“Yes, I realize that,” she replied, “and thank you for your
consideration.”

The coroner bowed, and after a brief pause, asked: “Did it never occur
to you to engage a nurse to attend to deceased?”

“Yes. I suggested it more than once to deceased, but he wouldn’t hear
of it. And I think he was right. There was nothing that a nurse could
have done for him. He was not helpless and he was not continuously
bed-ridden. He had a bell-push by his bedside and his secretary or the
servants were always ready to do anything that he wanted done. The
housemaid was most attentive to him. But he did not want much
attention. He kept the books that he was reading on his bedside table
and he liked to be left alone to read in peace. He felt that the
presence of a nurse would have been disturbing.”

“And at night?”

“At night his bell-push was connected with a bell in the secretary’s
bedroom. But he hardly ever used it. If his candle-lamp burned out he
could put in a fresh candle from the box on his table; and he never
seemed to want anything else.”

“Besides deceased and yourself, who were the inmates of the house?”

“There was my husband’s secretary, Mr. Wallingford, Miss Norris, the
cook, Anne Baker, the housemaid, Mabel Withers, and the kitchenmaid,
Doris Brown.”

“Why did deceased need a secretary? Did he transact much business?”

“No. The secretary wrote his few business letters, kept the accounts
and executed any commissions, besides doing the various things that
the master of the house would ordinarily have done. He is the son of
an old friend of my husband’s and he came to us when his father died.”

“And Miss Norris? What was her position in the household?”

“She lived with us as a guest at my husband’s invitation. She was the
daughter of his first wife’s sister, and he, more or less informally,
adopted her as he had no children of his own.”

“Deceased was a widower, then, when you married him?”

“Yes. His wife had been dead about two years.”

“What was his age when he died?”

“He had just turned fifty-seven.”

“On what sort of terms was deceased with the members of his
household?”

“On the best of terms with them all. He was an undemonstrative man and
rather cool and reserved with strangers and distinctly solitary and
self-contained. But he was a kind and generous man and all the
household, including the servants, were devoted to him.”

“Was deceased engaged in any business or profession?”

“No, he had independent means, inherited from his father.”

“Would you describe him as a wealthy man?”

“I believe he was quite well off, but he never spoke of his financial
affairs to me, or to anybody but his lawyers.”

“Do you know how his property is disposed of?”

“I know that he made a will, but I never enquired about the terms of
it and he never told me.”

“But surely you were an interested party.”

“It was understood that some provision would be made for me if I
survived him. That was all that concerned me. Deceased was not a man
with whom it was necessary to make conditions; and I have some small
property of my own. Mr. Mayfield, who is present, of course, knows
what the provisions of the will are as he is one of the executors.”

Once more the coroner paused to look over his notes. Then he glanced
inquiringly at the jury, and, when the foreman shook his head, he
thanked Barbara and dismissed her; and as she walked back to her
chair, pale and grave but perfectly composed, I found myself admiring
her calm dignity and only hoping that the other witnesses would make
as good a figure. But this hope was no sooner conceived than it was
shattered. The next name that was called was Madeline Norris and for a
few moments there was no response. At length Madeline rose slowly,
ashen and ghastly of face, and walked unsteadily to the table. Her
appearance—her deathly pallor and her trembling hands—struck me with
dismay; and what increased my concern for the unfortunate girl was the
subtle change in manner that I detected in the jury and the coroner.
The poor girl’s manifest agitation might surely have bespoken their
sympathy; but not a sign of sympathy was discernible in their
faces—nothing but a stony curiosity.

Having been sworn—on a testament which shook visibly in her grasp—she
deposed that her name was Madeline Norris and her age twenty-seven.

“Any occupation?” the coroner enquired drily without looking up.

“I am a teacher at the Westminster College of Domestic Science.”

“Teacher of what?”

“Principally of cookery and kitchen management, especially invalid
cookery.”

“Are you, yourself, a skilled cook?”

“Yes. It is my duty to demonstrate to the class.”

“Have you ever cooked or prepared food for the deceased?”

“Yes. I usually cooked his meals when I was in the house at meal
times.”

“It has been stated that you prepared the last meal that deceased
took. Is that correct?”

“Yes. I cooked an omelette for his supper.”

“Will you describe to us the way in which you prepared that omelette?”

Madeline considered for a few moments and then replied in a low, shaky
voice: “It was just a simple omelette. I first rubbed the pan with a
cut clove of garlic and put in the butter to heat. Then I broke an egg
into a cup, separated the yolk from the white, and, having beaten them
up separately, mixed them and added a very small portion of pounded
anchovy, a pinch or two of finely chopped parsley and a little salt. I
cooked it in the usual way and turned it out on a hot plate which I
covered at once.”

“Who took it up to deceased?”

“I did. I ran straight up with it and sat and talked to deceased while
he ate it.”

“Did you meet any one on your way up or in the bedroom?”

“No. There was nobody on the stairs, and the deceased was alone.”

“Did deceased take anything to drink with his supper?”

“Yes. He had a glass of chablis. I fetched the bottle and the glass
from the dining room and poured out the wine for him.”

“Did you meet anybody in the dining room or coming or going?”

“No, I met nobody.”

“Can you think of any way in which any poison could have got into the
omelette or into the wine?”

“No. Nothing could possibly have got into the omelette. As to the
wine, I poured it from the bottle into a clean glass. But the bottle
was already open and had been in the cellaret since lunch.”

“Now, with regard to the medicine. Did you give deceased any on the
day before his death?”

“Yes. I gave him a dose soon after I came in—about six o’clock. That
was the last dose in the bottle.”

“Did you notice anything unusual about the medicine?”

“No. It was similar to what he had been taking for some days past.”

“What was the medicine like?”

“It was nearly colourless with the faintest tinge of red and smelled
slightly of lavender and bitter orange.”

“Was there anything that caused you to notice particularly, on this
occasion, the appearance and smell of the medicine?”

“No. I noticed the colour and the smell when I opened the bottle on
the previous morning to give deceased a dose.”

“Did you examine the new bottle which had just been sent?”

“Yes. I looked at it and took out the cork and smelled it and tasted
it.”

“What made you do that?”

“I noticed that it seemed to contain Tincture of Cardamoms and I
smelled and tasted it to find out if the other ingredients had been
changed.”

“And what conclusion did you arrive at?”

“That they had not been changed. I could taste the Nux Vomica and
smell the orange and the Liquor Arsenicalis—at least the lavender.”

“Did you realize what the lavender smell was due to?”

“Yes. I recognized it as the smell of Liquor Arsenicalis. I knew that
deceased was taking Liquor Arsenicalis because I had asked Dr.
Dimsdale about it when I first noticed the smell.”

The coroner wrote down this answer and then, raising his head, looked
steadily at Madeline for some seconds without speaking; and the jury
looked harder still. At length the former spoke, slowly, deliberately,
emphatically.

“You have told us that you examined this medicine to find out what it
contained, and that you were able to recognize Tincture of Cardamoms
by its colour and Liquor Arsenicalis by its smell. It would seem,
then, that you know a good deal about drugs. Is that so?”

“I know something about drugs. My father was a doctor and he taught me
simple dispensing so that I could help him.”

The coroner nodded. “Was there any reason why you should have taken so
much interest in the composition of deceased’s medicine?”

Madeline did not answer immediately. And as she stood trembling and
hesitating in evident confusion, the coroner gazed at her stonily, and
the jury craned forward to catch her reply.

“I used to examine his medicine,” she replied at length, in a low
voice and a reluctant and confused manner, “because I knew that it
often contained Liquor Arsenicalis and I used to wonder whether that
was good for him. I understood from my father that it was a rather
irritating drug, and it did not seem very suitable for a patient who
suffered from gastritis.”

There was a pause after she had spoken and something in the appearance
of the inquisitors almost as if they had been a little disappointed by
this eminently reasonable answer. At length the coroner broke the
silence by asking, with a slight softening of manner:

“You have said that the change in colour of the last medicine led you
to taste and smell it to ascertain if the other ingredients had been
changed. You have said that you decided that they had not been
changed. Are you sure of that? Can you swear that the smell of
lavender was not stronger in this bottle than in the previous ones?”

“It did not seem to me to be stronger.”

“Supposing the bottle had then contained as much Liquor Arsenicalis as
was found in it by the analysts, would you have been able to detect it
by the smell or otherwise?”

“Yes, I feel sure that I should. The analysts found three ounces of
Liquor Arsenicalis; that would be nearly half the bottle. I am sure I
should have detected that amount, not only by the strong smell but by
the colour, too.”

“You are sure that the colour of this medicine was due to Cardamoms
only?”

“Yes, that is to cochineal. I recognized it at once. It is perfectly
unmistakable and quite different from the colour of Red Sandalwood,
with which Liquor Arsenicalis is coloured. Besides, this medicine was
only a deepish pink in colour. But if three ounces of Liquor
Arsenicalis had been in the bottle, the medicine would have been quite
a dark red.”

“You have had some experience in dispensing. Do you consider it
possible that the Liquor Arsenicalis could have been put into the
medicine by mistake when it was being made up?”

“It would be quite impossible if a minim measure-glass was used, as
the glass would have had to be filled twelve times. But this is never
done. One does not measure large quantities in small measures. Three
ounces would be measured out in a four or five ounce measure, as a
rule, or, possibly in a two ounce measure, by half refilling it.”

“Might not the wrong measure-glass have been taken up by mistake?”

“That is, of course, just possible. But it is most unlikely; for the
great disproportion between the large measure-glass and the little
stock-bottle would be so striking that it could hardly fail to be
noticed.”

“Then, from your own observation and from Dr. Dimsdale’s evidence, you
reject the idea that a mistake may have been made in dispensing this
bottle of medicine?”

“Yes, entirely. I have heard Dr. Dimsdale’s evidence and I examined
the medicine. I am convinced that he could not have made a mistake
under the circumstances that he described and I am certain that the
medicine that I saw did not contain more than a small quantity—less
than a drachm—of Liquor Arsenicalis.”

“You are not forgetting that the analysts actually found the
equivalent of three ounces of Liquor Arsenicalis in the bottle?”

“No. But I am sure it was not there when I examined the bottle.”

The coroner wrote down this answer with a deliberate air, and, when he
had finished, turned to the jury.

“I think we have nothing more to ask this witness, unless there is any
point that you want made more clear.”

There was a brief silence. Then the super-intelligent juryman
interposed.

“I should like to know if this witness ever had any Liquor Arsenicalis
in her possession.”

The coroner held up a warning hand to Madeline, and replied:

“That question, Sir, is not admissible. It is a principle of English
law that a witness cannot be compelled to make a statement
incriminating him—or herself. But an affirmative answer to this
question would be an incriminating statement.”

“But I am perfectly willing to answer the question,” Madeline said
eagerly. “I have never had in my possession any Liquor Arsenicalis or
any other preparation of arsenic.”

“That answers your question, Sir,” said the coroner, as he wrote down
the answer, “and if you have nothing more to ask, we can release the
witness.”

He handed his pen to Madeline, and when she had signed her
depositions—a terribly shaky signature it must have been—she came back
to her chair, still very pale and agitated, but obviously relieved at
having got through the ordeal. I had taken her arm as she sat down and
was complimenting her on the really admirable way in which she had
given her evidence, when I heard the name of Anthony Wallingford
called and realized that another unpleasant episode had arrived.



Chapter VI

The Verdict

I had not been taking much notice of Wallingford, my attention being
occupied with the two women when it strayed from the proceedings.
Beyond an irritated consciousness of his usual restless movements, I
had no information as to how the soul-shaking incidents of this
appalling day were affecting him. But when he rose drunkenly and,
grasping the back of his chair, rolled his eyes wildly round the
Court, I realized that there were breakers ahead.

When I say that he rose drunkenly, I use the word advisedly. Familiar
as I was with his peculiarities—his jerkings, twitchings and
grimacings—I saw, at once, that there was something unusual both in
his face and in his bearing; a dull wildness of expression and an
uncertainty of movement that I had never observed before. He had not
come to the Court with the rest of us, preferring, for some reason, to
come alone. And I now suspected that he had taken the opportunity to
fortify himself on the way.

I was not the only observer of his condition. As he walked, with
deliberate care, from his seat to the table, I noticed the coroner
eyeing him critically and the jury exchanging dubious glances and
whispered comments. He made a bad start by dropping the book on the
floor and sniggering nervously as he stooped to pick it up; and I
could see plainly, by the stiffness of the coroner’s manner that he
had made an unfavourable impression before he began his evidence.

“You were secretary to the deceased?” said the coroner, when the
witness had stated his name, age (33) and occupation. “What was the
nature of your duties?”

“The ordinary duties of a secretary,” was the dogged reply.

“Will you kindly give us particulars of what you did for deceased?”

“I opened his business letters and answered them and some of his
private ones. And I kept his accounts and paid his bills.”

“What accounts would those be? Deceased was not in business, I
understand?”

“No, they were his domestic accounts; his income from investments and
rents and his expenditure.”

“Did you attend upon deceased personally; I mean in the way of looking
after his bodily comfort and supplying his needs?”

“I used to look in on him from time to time to see if he wanted
anything done. But it wasn’t my business to wait on him. I was his
secretary, not his valet.”

“Who did wait on him, and attend to his wants?”

“The housemaid, chiefly, and Miss Norris, and of course, Mrs.
Monkhouse. But he didn’t usually want much but his food, his medicine,
a few books from the library and a supply of candles for his lamp. His
bell-push was connected with a bell in my room at night, but he never
rang it.”

“Then, practically, the housemaid did everything for him?”

“Not everything. Miss Norris cooked most of his meals, we all used to
give him his medicine, I used to put out his books and keep his
fountain pen filled, and Mrs. Monkhouse kept his candle-box supplied.
That was what he was most particular about as he slept badly and used
to read at night.”

“You give us the impression, Mr. Wallingford,” the coroner said,
dryly, “that you must have had a good deal of leisure.”

“Then I have given you the wrong impression. I was kept constantly on
the go, doing jobs, paying tradesmen, shopping and running errands.”

“For whom?”

“Everybody. Deceased, Mrs. Monkhouse, Miss Norris and even Dr.
Dimsdale. I was everybody’s servant.”

“What did you do for Mrs. Monkhouse?”

“I don’t see what that has got to do with this inquest?”

“That is not for you to decide,” the coroner said, sternly. “You will
be good enough to answer my question.”

Wallingford winced as if he had had his ears cuffed. In a moment, his
insolence evaporated and I could see his hands shaking as he,
evidently, cudgelled his brains for a reply. Suddenly he seemed to
have struck an idea.

“Shopping of various kinds,” said he; “for instance, there were the
candles for deceased. His lamp was of German make and English
lamp-candles wouldn’t fit it. So I used to have to go to a German shop
at Sparrow Corner by the Tower, to get packets of Schneider’s stearine
candles. That took about half a day.”

The coroner, stolidly and without comment, wrote down the answer, but
my experience as a counsel told me that it had been a dummy question,
asked to distract the witness’s attention and cover a more significant
one that was to follow. For that question I waited expectantly, and
when it came my surmise was confirmed.

“And Dr. Dimsdale? What did you have to do for him?”

“I used to help him with his books sometimes when he hadn’t got a
dispenser. I am a pretty good accountant and he isn’t.”

“Where does Dr. Dimsdale do his bookkeeping?”

“At the desk in the surgery.”

“And is that where you used to work?”

“Yes.”

“Used Dr. Dimsdale to work with you or did you do the books by
yourself?”

“I usually worked by myself.”

“At what time in the day used you to work there?”

“In the afternoon, as a rule.”

“At what hours does Dr. Dimsdale visit his patients?”

“Most of the day. He goes out about ten and finishes about six or
seven.”

“So that you would usually be alone in the surgery?”

“Yes, usually.”

As the coroner wrote down the answer I noticed the super-intelligent
juryman fidgeting in his seat. At length he burst out:

“Is the poison cupboard in the surgery?”

The coroner looked interrogatively at Wallingford, who stared at him
blankly in sudden confusion.

“You heard the question? Is the poison cupboard there?”

“I don’t know. It may be. It wasn’t any business of mine.”

“Is there any cupboard in the surgery? You must know that.”

“Yes, there is a cupboard there, but I don’t know what is in it.”

“Did you never see it open?”

“No. Never.”

“And you never had the curiosity to look into it?”

“Of course I didn’t. Besides I couldn’t. It was locked.”

“Was it always locked when you were there?”

“Yes, always.”

“Are you certain of that?”

“Yes, perfectly certain.”

Here the super-intelligent juror looked as if he were about to spring
across the table as he demanded eagerly:

“How does the witness know that that cupboard was locked?”

The coroner looked slightly annoyed. He had been playing his fish
carefully and was in no wise helped by this rude jerk of the line.
Nevertheless, he laid down his pen and looked expectantly at the
witness. As for Wallingford, he was struck speechless. Apparently his
rather muddled brain had suddenly taken in the import of the question,
for he stood with dropped jaw and damp, pallid face, staring at the
juryman in utter consternation.

“Well,” said the coroner, after an interval, “how did you know that it
was locked?”

Wallingford pulled himself together by an effort and replied:

“Why, I knew—I knew, of course, that it must be locked.”

“Yes; but the question is, how did you know?”

“Why it stands to reason that it must have been locked.”

“Why does it stand to reason? Cupboards are not always locked.”

“Poison cupboards are. Besides, you heard Dimsdale say that he always
kept this cupboard locked. He showed you the key.”

Once more the coroner, having noted the answer, laid down his pen and
looked steadily at the witness.

“Now, Mr. Wallingford,” said he, “I must caution you to be careful as
to what you say. This is a serious matter, and you are giving evidence
on oath. You said just now that you did not know whether the poison
cupboard was or was not in the surgery. You said that you did not know
what was in that cupboard. Now you say that you knew the cupboard must
have been locked because it was the poison cupboard. Then it seems
that you _did_ know that it was the poison cupboard. Isn’t that so?”

“No. I didn’t know then. I do now because I heard Dimsdale say that it
was.”

“Then, you said that you were perfectly certain that the cupboard was
always locked whenever you were working there. That meant that you
knew positively, as a fact, that it _was_ locked. Now you say that you
knew that it must be locked. But that is an assumption, an opinion, a
belief. Now, a man of your education must know the difference between
a mere belief and actual knowledge. Will you, please, answer
definitely: Did you, or did you not, know as a fact whether that
cupboard was or was not locked?”

“Well, I didn’t actually know, but I took it for granted that it was
locked.”

“You did not try the door?”

“Certainly not. Why should I?”

“Very well. Does any gentleman of the jury wish to ask any further
questions about this cupboard?”

There was a brief silence. Then the foreman said:

“We should like the witness to say what he means and not keep
contradicting himself.”

“You hear that, Sir,” said the coroner. “Please be more careful in
your answers in future. Now, I want to ask you about that last bottle
of medicine. Did you notice anything unusual in its appearance?”

“No. I didn’t notice it at all. I didn’t know that it had come.”

“Did you go into deceased’s room on that day—the Wednesday?”

“Yes, I went to see deceased in the morning about ten o’clock and gave
him a dose of his medicine; and I looked in on him in the evening
about nine o’clock to see if he wanted anything, but he didn’t.”

“Did you give him any medicine then?”

“No. It was not due for another hour.”

“What was his condition then?”

“He looked about the same as usual. He seemed inclined to doze, so I
did not stay long.”

“Is that the last time you saw him alive?”

“No. I looked in again just before eleven. He was then in much the
same state—rather drowsy—and, at his request, I turned out the gas and
left him.”

“Did you light the candle?”

“No, he always did that himself, if he wanted it.”

“Did you give him any medicine?”

“No. He had just had a dose.”

“Did he tell you that he had?”

“No. I could see that there was a dose gone.”

“From which bottle was that?”

“There was only one bottle there. It must have been the new bottle, as
only one dose had been taken.”

“What colour was the medicine?”

Wallingford hesitated a moment or two as if suspecting a trap. Then he
replied, doggedly: “I don’t know. I told you I didn’t notice it.”

“You said that you didn’t notice it at all and didn’t know that it had
come. Now you say that you observed that only one dose had been taken
from it and that you inferred that it was the new bottle. Which of
those statements is the true one?”

“They are both true,” Wallingford protested in a whining tone. “I
meant that I didn’t notice the medicine particularly and that I didn’t
know when it came.”

“That is not what you said,” the coroner rejoined. “However, we will
let that pass. Is there anything more that you wish to ask this
witness, gentlemen? If not, we will release him and take the evidence
of Mr. Mayfield.”

I think the jury would have liked to bait Wallingford but apparently
could not think of any suitable questions. But they watched him
malevolently as he added his—probably quite illegible—signature to his
depositions and followed him with their eyes as he tottered shakily
back to his seat. Immediately afterwards my name was called and I took
my place at the table, not without a slight degree of nervousness;
for, though I was well enough used to examinations, it was in the
capacity of examiner, not of witness, and I was fully alive to the
possibility of certain pitfalls which the coroner might, if he were
wide enough awake, dig for me. However, when I had been sworn and had
given my particulars (Rupert Mayfield, 35, Barrister-at-Law, of No. 64
Fig Tree Court, Inner Temple) the coroner’s conciliatory manner led me
to hope that it would be all plain sailing.

“How long have you known deceased?” was the first question.

“About two and a half years,” I replied.

“You are one of the executors of his will, Mrs. Monkhouse has told
us.”

“Yes.”

“Do you know why you were appointed executor after so short an
acquaintance?”

“I am an old friend of Mrs. Monkhouse. I have known her since she was
a little girl. I was a friend of her father—or rather, her
step-father.”

“Was it by her wish that you were made executor?”

“I believe that the suggestion came from the deceased’s family
solicitor, Mr. Brodribb, who is my co-executor. But probably he was
influenced by my long acquaintance with Mrs. Monkhouse.”

“Has probate been applied for?”

“Yes.”

“Then there can be no objections to your disclosing the provisions of
the will. We don’t want to hear them in detail, but I will ask you to
give us a general idea of the disposal of deceased’s property.”

“The gross value of the estate is about fifty-five thousand pounds, of
which twelve thousand represents real property and forty-three
thousand personal. The principal beneficiaries are: Mrs. Monkhouse,
who receives a house valued at four thousand pounds and twenty
thousand pounds in money and securities; the Reverend Amos Monkhouse,
land of the value of five thousand and ten thousand invested money;
Madeline Norris, a house and land valued at three thousand and five
thousand in securities; Anthony Wallingford, four thousand pounds.
Then there are legacies of a thousand pounds each to the two
executors, and of three hundred, two hundred and one hundred
respectively to the housemaid, the cook and the kitchen maid. That
accounts for the bulk of the estate. Mrs. Monkhouse is the residuary
legatee.”

The coroner wrote down the answer as I gave it and then read it out
slowly for me to confirm, working out, at the same time, a little sum
on a spare piece of paper—as did also the intellectual juryman.

“I think that gives us all the information we want,” the former
remarked, glancing at the jury; and as none of them made any comment,
he proceeded:

“Did you see much of deceased during the last few months?”

“I saw him usually once or twice a week. Sometimes oftener. But I did
not spend much time with him. He was a solitary, bookish man who
preferred to be alone most of his time.”

“Did you take particular notice of his state of health?”

“No, but I did observe that his health seemed to grow rather worse
lately.”

“Did it appear to you that he received such care and attention as a
man in his condition ought to have received?”

“It did not appear to me that he was neglected.”

“Did you realize how seriously ill he was?”

“No, I am afraid not. I regarded him merely as a chronic invalid.”

“It never occurred to you that he ought to have had a regular nurse?”

“No, and I do not think he would have consented. He greatly disliked
having any one about his room.”

“Is there anything within your knowledge that would throw any light on
the circumstances of his death?”

“No. Nothing.”

“Have you ever known arsenic in any form to be used in that household
for any purpose; any fly-papers, weed-killer or insecticides, for
instance?”

“No, I do not remember ever having seen anything used in that
household which, to my knowledge or belief, contained arsenic.”

“Do you know of any fact or circumstance which, in your opinion, ought
to be communicated to this Court or which might help the jury in
arriving at their verdict?”

“No, I do not.”

This brought my examination to an end. I was succeeded by the cook and
the kitchen-maid, but, as they had little to tell, and that little
entirely negative, their examination was quite brief. When the last
witness was dismissed, the coroner addressed the jury.

“We have now, gentlemen,” said he, “heard all the evidence that is at
present available, and we have the choice of two courses; which are,
either to adjourn the inquiry until further evidence is available, or
to find a verdict on the evidence which we have heard. I incline
strongly to the latter plan. We are now in a position to answer the
questions, how, when and where the deceased came by his death, and
when we have done that, we shall have discharged our proper function.
What is your feeling on the matter, gentlemen?”

The jury’s feeling was very obviously that they wished to get the
inquiry over and go about their business, and when they had made this
clear, the coroner proceeded to sum up.

“I shall not detain you, gentlemen, with a long address. All that is
necessary is for me to recapitulate the evidence very briefly and
point out the bearing of it.

“First as to the cause of death. It has been given in evidence by two
fully qualified and expert witnesses that deceased died from the
effects of poisoning by arsenic. That is a matter of fact which is not
disputed and which you must accept, unless you have any reasons for
rejecting their testimony, which I feel sure you have not. Accepting
the fact of death by poison, the question then arises as to how the
poison came to be taken by deceased. There are three possibilities: he
may have taken it himself, voluntarily and knowingly; he may have
taken it by accident or mischance; or it may have been administered to
him knowingly and maliciously by some other person or persons. Let us
consider those three possibilities.

“The suggestion that deceased might have taken the poison voluntarily
is highly improbable in three respects. First, since deceased was
mostly bed-ridden, it would have been almost impossible for him to
have obtained the poison. Second, there is the nature of the poison.
Arsenic has often been used for homicidal poisoning but seldom for
suicide; for an excellent reason. The properties of arsenic which
commend it to poisoners—its complete freedom from taste and the
indefinite symptoms that it produces—do not commend it to the suicide.
He has no need to conceal either the administration or its results.
His principal need is rapidity of effect. But arsenic is a relatively
slow poison and one which usually causes great suffering. It is not at
all suited to the suicide. Then there is the third objection that the
mode of administration was quite unlike that of a suicide. For the
latter usually takes his poison in one large dose, to get the business
over; but here it was evidently given in repeated small doses over a
period that may have been anything from a week to a year. And,
finally, there is not a particle of evidence in favour of the
supposition that deceased took the poison himself.

“To take the second case, that of accident: the only possibility known
to us is that of a mistake in dispensing the medicine. But the
evidence of Dr. Dimsdale and Miss Norris must have convinced you that
the improbability of a mistake is so great as to be practically
negligible. Of course, the poison might have found its way
accidentally into the medicine or the food or both in some manner
unknown to us. But while we admit this, we have, in fact, to form our
decision on what is known to us, not what is conceivable but unknown.

“When we come to the third possibility, that the poison was
administered to deceased by some other person or persons with intent
to compass his death, we find it supported by positive evidence. There
is the bottle of medicine for instance. It contained a large quantity
of arsenic in a soluble form. But two witnesses have sworn that it
could not have contained, and, in fact, did not contain that quantity
of arsenic when it left Dr. Dimsdale’s surgery or when it was
delivered at deceased’s house. Moreover, Miss Norris has sworn that
she examined this bottle of medicine at six o’clock in the evening and
that it did not then contain more than a small quantity—less than a
drachm—of Liquor Arsenicalis. She was perfectly positive. She spoke
with expert knowledge. She gave her reasons, and they were sound
reasons. So that the evidence in our possession is to the effect that
at six o’clock in the afternoon, that bottle of medicine did not
contain more than a drachm—about a teaspoonful—of Liquor Arsenicalis;
whereas at half-past ten, when a dose from the bottle was given to
deceased by the housemaid, it contained some three ounces—about six
tablespoonfuls. This is proved by the discovery of the poison in the
stomach of deceased and by the exact analysis of the contents of the
bottle. It follows that, between six o’clock and half-past ten, that a
large quantity of arsenical solution must have been put into the
bottle. It is impossible to suppose that it could have got in by
accident. Somebody must have put it in; and the only conceivable
object that the person could have had in putting that poison into the
bottle would be to cause the death of deceased.

“But further; the evidence of the medical witnesses proves that
arsenic had been taken by deceased on several previous occasions.
That, in fact, he had been taking arsenic in relatively small doses
for some time past—how long we do not know—and had been suffering from
chronic arsenical poisoning. The evidence, therefore, points very
strongly and definitely to the conclusion that some person or persons
had been, for some unascertained time past, administering arsenic to
him.

“Finally, as to the identity of the person or persons who administered
the poison, I need not point out that we have no evidence. You will
have noticed that a number of persons benefit in a pecuniary sense by
deceased’s death. But that fact establishes no suspicion against any
of them in the absence of positive evidence; and there is no positive
evidence connecting any one of them with the administration of the
poison. With these remarks, gentlemen, I leave you to consider the
evidence and agree upon your decision.”

The jury did not take long in arriving at their verdict. After a few
minutes’ eager discussion, the foreman announced that they had come to
an unanimous decision.

“And what is the decision upon which you have agreed?” the coroner
asked.

“We find,” was the reply, “that deceased died from the effects of
arsenic, administered to him by some person or persons unknown, with
the deliberate intention of causing his death.”

“Yes,” said the coroner; “that is, in effect, a verdict of wilful
murder against some person or persons unknown. I agree with you
entirely. No other verdict was possible on the evidence before us. It
is unfortunate that no clue has happened as to the perpetrator of this
abominable crime, but we may hope that the investigations of the
police will result in the identification and conviction of the
murderer.”

The conclusion of the coroner’s address brought the proceedings to an
end, and as he finished speaking, the spectators rose and began to
pass out of the Court. I remained for a minute to speak a few words to
Mr. Holman and ask him to transcribe his report in duplicate. Then, I,
too, went out to find my three companions squeezing into a taxicab
which had drawn up opposite the entrance, watched with ghoulish
curiosity by a quite considerable crowd. The presence of that crowd
informed me that the horrible notoriety which I had foreseen had even
now begun to envelop us. The special editions of the evening papers
were already out, with, at least, the opening scenes of the inquest in
print. Indeed, during the short drive to Hilborough Square, I saw more
than one news-vendor dealing out papers to little knots of eager
purchasers, and once, through the open window, a stentorian voice was
borne in with hideous distinctness, announcing: “Sensational Inquest!
Funeral stopped!”

I glanced from Wallingford, cowering in his corner, to Barbara,
sitting stiffly upright with a slight frown on her pale face. As she
caught my eye, she remarked bitterly:

“It seems that we are having greatness thrust upon us.”



Chapter VII

The Search Warrant

The consciousness of the horrid notoriety that had already attached
itself to us was brought home to me once more when the taxi drew up at
the house in Hilborough Square. I stepped out first to pay the driver,
and Barbara following, with the latch-key ready in her hand, walked
swiftly to the door, looking neither to the right nor left, opened it
and disappeared into the hall; while the other two, lurking in the cab
until the door was open, then darted across the pavement, entered and
disappeared also. Nor was their hasty retreat unjustified. Lingering
doggedly and looking about me with a sort of resentful defiance, I
found myself a focus of observation. In the adjoining houses, not a
window appeared to be unoccupied. The usually vacant foot-way was
populous with loiterers whose interest in me and in the ill-omened
house was undissembled; while raucous voices, strange to those quiet
precincts, told me that the astute news-vendors had scented and
exploited a likely market.

With ill-assumed indifference I entered the house and shut the
door—perhaps rather noisily; and was about to enter the dining-room
when I heard hurried steps descending the stairs and paused to look
up. It was the woman—the cook’s sister, I think—who had been left to
take care of the house while the servants were absent; and something
of eagerness and excitement in her manner caused me to walk to the
foot of the stairs to meet her.

“Is anything amiss?” I asked in a low voice as she neared the bottom
of the flight.

She held up a warning finger, and coming close to me, whispered
hoarsely:

“There’s two gentlemen upstairs, Sir, leastways they look like
gentlemen, but they are really policemen.”

“What are they doing upstairs?” I asked.

“Just walking through the rooms and looking about. They came about a
quarter of an hour ago, and when I let them in they said they were
police officers and that they had come to search the premises.”

“Did they say anything about a warrant?”

“Oh, yes, Sir. I forgot about that. One of them showed me a paper and
said it was a search warrant. So of course I couldn’t do anything. And
then they started going through the house with their note-books like
auctioneers getting ready for a sale.”

“I will go up and see them,” said I; “and meanwhile you had better let
Mrs. Monkhouse know. Where did you leave them?”

“In the large back bedroom on the first floor,” she replied. “I think
it was Mr. Monkhouse’s.”

On this I began quickly to ascend the stairs, struggling to control a
feeling of resentment which, though natural enough, I knew to be quite
unreasonable. Making my way direct to the dead man’s room, I entered
and found two tall men standing before an open cupboard. They turned
on hearing me enter and the elder of them drew a large wallet from his
pocket.

“Mr. Mayfield, I think, Sir,” said he. “I am Detective Superintendent
Miller and this is Detective-Sergeant Cope. Here is my card and this
is the search warrant, if you wish to see it.”

I glanced at the document and returning it to him asked: “Wouldn’t it
have been more in order if you had waited to show the warrant to Mrs.
Monkhouse before beginning your search?”

“That is what we have done,” he replied, suavely. “We have disturbed
nothing yet. We have just been making a preliminary inspection. Of
course,” he continued, “I understand how unpleasant this search is for
Mrs. Monkhouse and the rest of your friends, but you, Sir, as a lawyer
will realize the position. That poor gentleman was poisoned with
arsenic in this house. Somebody in this house had arsenic in his or
her possession and we have got to see if any traces of it are left.
After all, you know, Sir, we are acting in the interests of everybody
but the murderer.”

This was so obviously true that it left me nothing to say. Nor was
there any opportunity, for, as the superintendent concluded, Barbara
entered the room. I looked at her a little anxiously as I briefly
explained the situation. But there was no occasion. Pale and sombre of
face, she was nevertheless perfectly calm and self-possessed and
greeted the two officers without a trace of resentment; indeed, when
the superintendent was disposed to be apologetic, she cut him short by
exclaiming energetically: “But, surely, who should be more anxious to
assist you than I? It is true that I find it incredible that this
horrible crime could have been perpetrated by any member of my
household. But it was perpetrated by somebody. And if, either here or
elsewhere, I can help you in any way to drag that wretch out into the
light of day, I am at your service, no matter who the criminal may be.
Do you wish any one to attend you in your search?”

“I think, Madam, it would be well if you were present, and perhaps Mr.
Mayfield. If we want any of the others, we can send for them. Where
are they now?”

“Miss Norris and Mr. Wallingford are in the dining room. The servants
have just come in and I think have gone to the kitchen or their
sitting room.”

“Then,” said Miller, “we had better begin with the dining room.”

We went down the stairs, preceded by Barbara, who opened the dining
room door and introduced the visitors to the two inmates in tones as
quiet and matter-of-fact as if she were announcing the arrival of the
gas-fitter or the upholsterer. I was sorry that the other two had not
been warned, for the announcement took them both by surprise and they
were in no condition for surprises of this rather alarming kind. At
the word “search,” Madeline started up with a smothered exclamation
and then sat down again, trembling and pale as death; while as for
Wallingford, if the two officers had come to pinion him and lead him
forth to the gallows, he could not have looked more appalled.

Our visitors were scrupulously polite, but they were also keenly
observant and I could see that each had made a mental note of the
effect of their arrival. But, of course, they made no outward sign of
interest in any of us but proceeded stolidly with their business; and
I noticed that, before proceeding to a detailed inspection, they
opened their note-books and glanced through what was probably a rough
inventory, to see that nothing had been moved in the interval since
their preliminary inspection.

The examination of the dining room was, however, rather perfunctory.
It contained nothing that appeared to interest them, and after going
through the contents of the sideboard cupboards methodically, the
superintendent turned a leaf of his note-book and said:

“I think that will do, Madam. Perhaps we had better take the library
next. Who keeps the keys of the bureau and the cupboard?”

“Mr. Wallingford has charge of the library,” replied Barbara. “Will
you give the superintendent your keys, Tony?”

“There’s no need for that,” said Miller. “If Mr. Wallingford will come
with us, he can unlock the drawers and cupboard and tell us anything
that we want to know about the contents.”

Wallingford rose with a certain alacrity and followed us into the
library, which adjoined the dining room. Here the two officers again
consulted their note-books, and having satisfied themselves that the
room was as they had left it, began a detailed survey, watched closely
and with evident anxiety by Wallingford. They began with a cupboard,
or small armoire, which formed the upper member of a large,
old-fashioned bureau. Complying with Miller’s polite request that it
might be unlocked, Wallingford produced a bunch of keys, and,
selecting from it, after much nervous fumbling, a small key,
endeavoured to insert it into the keyhole; but his hand was in such a
palsied condition that he was unable to introduce it.

“Shall I have a try, Sir?” the superintendent suggested, patiently,
adding with a smile, “I don’t smoke quite so many cigarettes as you
seem to.”

His efforts, however, also failed, for the evident reason that it was
the wrong key. Thereupon he looked quickly through the bunch, picked
out another key and had the cupboard open in a twinkling, revealing a
set of shelves crammed with a disorderly litter of cardboard boxes,
empty ink-bottles, bundles of letters and papers and the miscellaneous
rubbish that accumulates in the receptacles of a thoroughly untidy
man. The superintendent went through the collection methodically,
emptying the shelves, one at a time, on to the flap of the bureau,
where he and the sergeant sorted the various articles and examining
each, returned it to the shelf. It was a tedious proceeding and, so
far as I could judge, unproductive, for, when all the shelves had been
looked through and every article separately inspected, nothing was
brought to light save an empty foolscap envelope which had apparently
once contained a small box and was addressed to Wallingford, and two
pieces of what looked like chemist’s wrapping-paper, the creases in
which showed that they had been small packets. These were not returned
to the shelves, but, without comment, enclosed in a large envelope on
which the superintendent scribbled a few words with a pencil and which
was then consigned to a large handbag that the sergeant had brought in
with him from the hall.

The large drawers of the bureau were next examined. Like the shelves,
they were filled with a horrible accumulation of odds and ends which
had evidently been stuffed into them to get them out of the way. From
this collection nothing was obtained which interested the officers,
who next turned their attention to the small drawers and pigeonholes
at the back of the flap. These, however, contained nothing but
stationery and a number of letters, bills and other papers, which the
two officers glanced through and replaced. When all the small drawers
and pigeonholes had been examined, the superintendent stood up, fixing
a thoughtful glance at the middle of the range of drawers; and I
waited expectantly for the next development. Like many old bureaus,
this one had as a central feature a nest of four very small drawers
enclosed by a door. I knew the arrangement very well, and so,
apparently, did the superintendent; for, once more opening the top
drawer, he pulled it right out and laid it on the writing flap. Then,
producing from his pocket a folding foot-rule, he thrust it into one
of the pigeonholes, showing a depth of eight and a half inches, and
then into the case of the little drawer, which proved to be only a
fraction over five inches deep.

“There is something more here than meets the eye,” he remarked
pleasantly. “Do you know what is at the back of those drawers, Mr.
Wallingford?”

The unfortunate secretary, who had been watching the officer’s
proceedings with a look of consternation, did not reply for a few
moments, but remained staring wildly at the aperture from which the
drawer had been taken out.

“At the back?” he stammered, at length. “No, I can’t say that I do. It
isn’t my bureau, you know. I only had the use of it.”

“I see,” said Miller. “Well, I expect we can soon find out.”

He drew out a second drawer and, grasping the partition between the
two, gave a gentle pull, when the whole nest slid easily forward and
came right out of its case. Miller laid it on the writing flap, and,
turning it round, displayed a sliding lid at the back, which he drew
up; when there came into view a set of four little drawers similar to
those in front but furnished with leather tabs instead of handles.
Miller drew out the top drawer and a sudden change in the expression
on his face told me that he had lighted on something that seemed to
him significant.

“Now I wonder what this is?” said he, taking from the drawer a small
white-paper packet. “Feels like some sort of powder. You say you don’t
know anything about it, Mr. Wallingford?”

Wallingford shook his head but made no further reply, whereupon the
superintendent laid the packet on the flap and very carefully unfolded
the ends—it had already been opened—when it was seen that the contents
consisted of some two or three teaspoonfuls of a fine, white powder.

“Well,” said Miller, “we shall have to find out what it is. Will you
pass me that bit of sealing-wax, Sergeant?”

He reclosed the packet with the greatest care and having sealed both
the ends with his signet-ring, enclosed it in an envelope and put it
into his inside breast pocket. Then he returned to the little nest of
drawers. The second drawer was empty, but on pulling out the third, he
uttered an exclamation.

“Well, now! Look at that! Somebody seems to have been fond of physic.
And there’s no doubt as to what this is. Morphine hydrochlor, a
quarter of a grain.”

As he spoke, he took out of the drawer a little bottle filled with
tiny white discs or tablets and bearing on the label the inscription
which the superintendent had read out. Wallingford gazed at it with a
foolish expression of surprise as Miller held it up for our—and
particularly Wallingford’s—inspection; and Barbara, I noticed, cast at
the latter a side-long, inscrutable glance which I sought in vain to
interpret.

“Morphine doesn’t seem much to the point,” Miller remarked as he
wrapped the little bottle in paper and bestowed it in his inner
pocket, “but, of course, we have only got the evidence of the label.
It may turn out to be something else, when the chemical gentlemen come
to test it.”

With this he grasped the tab of the bottom drawer and drew the latter
out; and in a moment his face hardened. Very deliberately, he picked
out a small, oblong envelope, which appeared once to have contained a
box or hard packet, but was now empty. It had evidently come through
the post and was addressed in a legible business hand to “A.
Wallingford Esq., 16 Hilborough Square.” Silently the superintendent
held it out for us all to see, as he fixed a stern look on
Wallingford. “You observe, Sir,” he said, at length, “that the
post-mark is dated the 20th of August; only about a month ago. What
have you to say about it?”

“Nothing,” was the sullen reply. “What comes to me by post is my
affair. I am not accountable to you or anybody else.”

For a moment, the superintendent’s face took on a very ugly
expression. But he seemed to be a wise man and not unkindly, for he
quickly controlled his irritation and rejoined without a trace of
anger, though gravely enough:

“Be advised by me, Mr. Wallingford, and don’t make trouble for
yourself. Let me remind you what the position is. In this house a man
has died from arsenic poisoning. The police will have to find out how
that happened and if any one is open to the suspicion of having
poisoned him. I have come here to-day for that purpose with full
authority to search this house. In the course of my search I have
asked you for certain information, and you have made a number of false
statements. Believe me, Sir, that is a very dangerous thing to do. It
inevitably raises the question why those false statements should have
been made. Now, I am going to ask you one or two questions. You are
not bound to answer them, but you will be well advised to hold nothing
back, and, above all, to say nothing that is not true. To begin with
that packet of powder. What do you say that packet contains?”

Wallingford, who characteristically, was now completely cowed by the
superintendent’s thinly-veiled threats, hung his head for a moment and
then replied, almost inaudibly, “Cocaine.”

“What were you going to do with cocaine?” Miller asked.

“I was going to take a little of it for my health.”

The superintendent smiled faintly as he demanded:

“And the morphine tablets?”

“I had thought of taking one of them occasionally to—er—to steady my
nerves.”

Miller nodded, and casting a swift glance at the sergeant, asked:

“And the packet that was in this envelope: what did that contain?”

Wallingford hesitated and was so obviously searching for a plausible
lie that Miller interposed, persuasively: “Better tell the truth and
not make trouble”; whereupon Wallingford replied in a barely audible
mumble that the packet had contained a very small quantity of cocaine.

“What has become of that cocaine?” the superintendent asked.

“I took part of it; the rest got spilt and lost.”

Miller nodded rather dubiously at this reply and then asked:

“Where did you get this cocaine and the morphine?”

Wallingford hesitated for some time and at length, plucking up a
little courage again, replied:

“I would rather not answer that question. It really has nothing to do
with your search. You are looking for arsenic.”

Miller reflected for a few moments and then rejoined, quietly:

“That isn’t quite correct, Mr. Wallingford. I am looking for anything
that may throw light on the death of Mr. Monkhouse. But I don’t want
to press you unduly, only I would point out that you could not have
come by these drugs lawfully. You are not a doctor or a chemist.
Whoever supplied you with them was acting illegally and you have been
a party to an illegal transaction in obtaining them. However, if you
refuse to disclose the names of the persons who supplied them, we will
let the matter pass, at least for the present; but I remind you that
you have had these drugs in your possession and that you may be, and
probably will be compelled to give an account of the way in which you
obtained them.”

With that he pocketed the envelope, closed the drawers and turned to
make a survey of the room. There was very little in it, however, for
the bureau and its surmounting cupboard were the only receptacles in
which anything could be concealed, the whole of the walls being
occupied by open book-shelves about seven feet high. But even these
the superintendent was not prepared to take at their face value.
First, he stood on a chair and ran his eye slowly along the tops of
all the shelves; then he made a leisurely tour of the room, closely
inspecting each row of books, now and again taking one out or pushing
one in against the back of the shelves. A set of box-files was
examined in detail, each one being opened to ascertain that it
contained nothing but papers, and even one or two obvious portfolios
were taken out and inspected. Nothing noteworthy, however, was brought
to light by this rigorous search until the tour of inspection was
nearly completed. The superintendent was, in fact, approaching the
door when his attention was attracted by a row of books which seemed
to be unduly near the front edge of the shelf. Opposite this he halted
and began pushing the books back, one at a time. Suddenly I noticed
that one of the books, on being pushed, slid back about half an inch
and stopped as if there were something behind it. And there was. When
the superintendent grasped the book and drew it out, there came into
view, standing against the back of the shelf, a smallish bottle,
apparently empty, and bearing a white label.

“Queer place to keep a bottle,” Miller remarked, adding, with a smile,
“unless it were a whiskey bottle, which it isn’t.” He drew it out, and
after looking at it suspiciously and holding it up to the light, took
out the cork and sniffed at it. “Well,” he continued, “it is an empty
bottle and it is labelled ‘Benzine.’ Do you know anything about it,
Mr. Wallingford?”

“No, I don’t,” was the reply. “I don’t use benzine, and if I did I
should not keep it on a book-shelf. But I don’t see that it matters
much. There isn’t any harm in benzine, is there?”

“Probably not,” said Miller; “but, you see, the label doesn’t agree
with the smell. What do you say, Mrs. Monkhouse?”

He once more drew out the cork and held the bottle towards her. She
took it from him and having smelled at it, replied promptly:

“It smells to me like lavender. Possibly the bottle has had lavender
water in it, though I shouldn’t, myself, have chosen a benzine bottle
to keep a perfume in.”

“I don’t think it was lavender water,” said the superintendent. “That,
I think, is nearly colourless. But the liquid that was in this bottle
was red. As I hold it up to the light, you can see a little ring of
red round the edge of the bottom. I daresay the chemists will be able
to tell us what was in the bottle, but the question now is, who put it
there? You are sure you can’t tell us anything about it, Mr.
Wallingford?”

“I have never seen it before, I assure you,” the latter protested
almost tearfully. “I know nothing about it, whatsoever. That is the
truth, Superintendent; I swear to God it is.”

“Very well, Sir,” said Miller, writing a brief note on the label and
making an entry in his note-book. “Perhaps it is of no importance
after all. But we shall see. I think we have finished this room.
Perhaps, Sergeant, you might take a look at the drawing room while I
go through Mr. Monkhouse’s room. It will save time. And I needn’t
trouble you any more just at present, Mr. Wallingford.”

The secretary retired, somewhat reluctantly, to the dining room while
Barbara led the way to the first floor. As we entered the room in
which that unwitnessed tragedy had been enacted in the dead of the
night, I looked about me with a sort of shuddering interest. The bed
had been stripped, but otherwise nothing seemed to be changed since I
had seen the room but a few days ago when it was still occupied by its
dread tenant. The bedside table still bore its pathetic furnishings;
the water-bottle, the little decanter, the books, the candle-box, the
burnt-out lamp, the watch—though that ticked no longer, but seemed,
with its motionless hands, to echo the awesome stillness that pervaded
that ill-omened room.

As the superintendent carried out his methodical search, joined
presently by the sergeant, Barbara came and stood by me with her eyes
fixed gloomily on the table.

“Were you thinking of him, Rupert?” she whispered. “Were you thinking
of that awful night when he lay here, dying, all alone, and I— Oh! the
thought of it will haunt me every day of my life until my time comes,
too, however far off that may be.”

I was about to make some reply, as consolatory as might be, when the
superintendent announced that he had finished and asked that
Wallingford might be sent for to be present at the examination of his
room. I went down to deliver the message, and, as it would have
appeared intrusive for me to accompany him, I stayed in the dining
room with Madeline, who, though she had recovered from the shock of
the detectives’ arrival, was still pale and agitated.

“Poor Tony seemed dreadfully upset when he came back just now,” she
said. “What was it that happened in the library?”

“Nothing very much,” I answered. “The superintendent unearthed his
little stock of dope; which, of course, was unpleasant for him, but it
would not have mattered if he had not been fool enough to lie about
it. That was a fatal thing to do, under the circumstances.”

As Wallingford seemed not to have said anything about the bottle, I
made no reference to it, but endeavoured to distract her attention
from what was going on in the house by talking of other matters. Nor
was it at all difficult; for the truth is that we all, with one
accord, avoided any reference to the horrible fact which was staring
us in the face, and of which we must all have been fully conscious. So
we continued a somewhat banal conversation, punctuated by pauses in
which our thoughts stole secretly back to the hideous realities,
until, at length, Wallingford returned, pale and scowling, and flung
himself into an arm-chair. Madeline looked at him inquiringly, but as
he offered no remark but sat in gloomy silence, smoking furiously, she
asked him no questions, nor did I.

A minute or two later, Barbara came into the room, quietly and with an
air of calm self-possession that was quite soothing in the midst of
the general emotional tension.

“Do you mind coming up, Madeline?” she said. “They are examining your
room and they want you to unlock the cupboard. You have your keys
about you, I suppose?”

“Yes,” Madeline replied, rising and taking from her pocket a little
key-wallet. “That is the key. Will you take it up to them?”

“I think you had better come up yourself,” Barbara replied. “It is
very unpleasant but, of course, they have to go through the
formalities, and we must not appear unwilling to help them.”

“No, of course,” said Madeline. “Then I will come with you, but I
should like Rupert to come, too, if he doesn’t mind. Will you?” she
asked, looking at me appealingly. “Those policemen make me feel so
nervous.”

Of course, I assented at once; and as Wallingford, muttering “Damned
impertinence! Infernal indignity!” rose to open the door for us, we
passed out and took our way upstairs.

“I am sorry to trouble you, Miss Norris,” said Miller, in a suave
tone, as we entered, “but we must see everything if only to be able to
say that we have. Would you be so kind as to unlock this cupboard?”

He indicated a narrow cupboard which occupied one of the recesses by
the chimney-breast, and Madeline at once inserted the key and threw
open the door. The interior was then seen to be occupied by shelves,
of which the lower ones were filled, tidily enough, with an assortment
of miscellaneous articles—shoes, shoe-trees, brushes, leather bags,
cardboard boxes, note-books and other “oddments”—while the top shelf
seemed to have been used as a repository for jars, pots and bottles,
of which several appeared to be empty. It was this shelf which seemed
to attract the superintendent’s attention and he began operations by
handing out its various contents to the sergeant, who set them down on
a table in orderly rows. When they were all set out and the
superintendent had inspected narrowly and swept his hand over the
empty shelf, the examination of the jars and bottles began.

The procedure was very methodical and thorough. First, the sergeant
picked up a bottle or jar, looked it over carefully read the label if
there was one, uncovered or uncorked it, smelled it and passed it to
the superintendent, who, when he had made a similar inspection, put it
down at the opposite end of the table.

“Can you tell us what this is?” Miller asked, holding out a bottle
filled with a thickish, nearly black liquid.

“That is caramel,” Madeline replied. “I use it in my cookery classes
and for cooking at home, too.”

The superintendent regarded the bottle a little dubiously but set it
down at the end of the table without comment. Presently he received
from the sergeant a glass jar filled with a brownish powder.

“There is no label on this,” he remarked, exhibiting it to Madeline.

“No,” she replied. “It is turmeric. That also is used in my classes;
and that other is powdered saffron.”

“I wonder you don’t label them,” said Miller. “It would be easy for a
mistake to occur with all these unlabelled bottles.”

“Yes,” she admitted, “they ought to be labelled. But I know what each
of them is, and they are all pretty harmless. Most of them are
materials that are used in cookery demonstrations, but that one that
you have now is French chalk, and the one the sergeant has is
pumice-powder.”

“H’m,” grunted Miller, dipping his finger into the former and rubbing
it on his thumb; “what would happen if you thickened a soup with
French chalk or pumice-powder? Not very good for the digestion, I
should think.”

“No, I suppose not,” Madeline agreed, with the ghost of a smile on her
pale face. “I must label them in future.”

During this colloquy I had been rapidly casting my eye over the
collection that still awaited examination, and my attention had been
almost at once arrested by an empty bottle near the end of the row. It
looked to me like the exact counterpart of the bottle which had been
found in the library; a cylindrical bottle of about the capacity of
half a pint, or rather less, and like the other, labelled in printed
characters “Benzine.”

But mine was not the only eye that had observed it. Presently, I saw
the sergeant pick it up—out of its turn—scrutinize it suspiciously,
hold it up to the light, take out the cork and smell both it and the
bottle, and then, directing the latter, telescope-fashion, towards the
window, inspect the bottom by peering in through the mouth. Finally,
he clapped in the cork with some emphasis, and with a glance full of
meaning handed the bottle to the superintendent.

The latter repeated the procedure in even more detail. When he had
finished, he turned to Madeline with a distinctly inquisitorial air.

“This bottle, Miss Norris,” said he, “is labelled ‘Benzine.’ But it
was not benzine that it contained. Will you kindly smell it and tell
me what you think it did contain. Or perhaps you can say off-hand.”

“I am afraid I can’t,” she replied. “I have no recollection of having
had any benzine and I don’t remember this bottle at all. As it is in
my cupboard I suppose I must have put it there, but I don’t remember
having ever seen it before. I can’t tell you anything about it.”

“Well, will you kindly smell it and tell me what you think it
contained?” the superintendent persisted, handing her the open bottle.
She took it from him apprehensively, and, holding it to her nose, took
a deep sniff; and instantly her already pale face became dead white to
the very lips.

“It smells of lavender,” she said in a faint voice.

“So I thought,” said Miller. “And now, Miss Norris, if you will look
in at the mouth of the bottle against the light you will see a faint
red ring round the bottom. Apparently, the liquid that the bottle
contained was a red liquid. Moreover, if you hold the bottle against
the light and look through the label, you can see the remains of
another label under it. There is only a tiny scrap of it left, but it
is enough for us to see that it was a red label. So it would seem that
the liquid was a poisonous liquid—poisonous enough to require a red
poison label. And then you notice that this red poison label seems to
have been scraped off and the benzine label stuck on over the place
where it had been, although, as the lavender smell and the red stain
clearly show, the bottle never had any benzine in it at all. Now, Miss
Norris, bearing those facts in mind, I ask you if you can tell me what
was in that bottle.”

“I have told you,” Madeline replied with unexpected firmness, “that I
know nothing about this bottle. I have no recollection of ever having
seen it before. I do not believe that it ever belonged to me. It may
have been in the cupboard when I first began to use it. At any rate, I
am not able to tell you anything about it.”

The superintendent continued to look at her keenly, still holding the
bottle. After a few moments’ silence he persisted:

“A red, poisonous liquid which smells of lavender. Can you not form
any idea as to what it was?”

I was about to enter a protest—for the question was really not
admissible—when Madeline, now thoroughly angry and quite
self-possessed, replied, stiffly: “I don’t know what you mean. I have
told you that I know nothing about this bottle. Are you suggesting
that I should try to guess what it contained?”

“No,” he rejoined hastily; “certainly not. A guess wouldn’t help us at
all. If you really do not know anything about the bottle, we must
leave it at that. You always keep this cupboard locked, I suppose?”

“Usually. But I am not very particular about it. There is nothing of
value in the cupboard, as you see, and the servants are quite
trustworthy. I sometimes leave the key in the door, but I don’t
imagine that anybody ever meddles with it.”

The superintendent took the key out of the lock and regarded it
attentively. Then he examined the lock itself, and I also took the
opportunity of inspecting it. Both the lock and the key were of the
simplest kind, just ordinary builder’s fittings, which, so far as any
real security was concerned, could not be taken seriously. In the
absence of the key, a stiff wire or a bent hair-pin would probably
have shot the little bolt quite easily, as I took occasion to remark
to the superintendent, who frankly agreed with me.

The bottle having been carefully wrapped up and deposited in the
sergeant’s hand-bag, the examination was resumed; but nothing further
of an interesting or suspicious character was discovered among the
bottles or jars. Nor did the sorting-out of the miscellaneous contents
of the lower shelves yield anything remarkable with a single
exception. When the objects on the lowest shelf had been all taken
out, a small piece of white paper was seen at the back, and on this
Miller pounced with some eagerness. As he brought it out I could see
that it was a chemist’s powder paper, about six inches square (when
Miller had carefully straightened it out), and the creases which
marked the places where it had been folded showed that it had
contained a mass of about the bulk of a dessert-spoonful. But what
attracted my attention—and the superintendent’s—was the corner of a
red label which adhered to a torn edge in company with a larger
fragment of a white label on which the name or description of the
contents had presumably been written or printed. Miller held it out
towards Madeline, who looked at it with a puzzled frown.

“Do you remember what was in this paper, Miss Norris?” the former
asked.

“I am afraid I don’t,” she replied.

“H’m,” grunted Miller; “I should have thought you would. It seems to
have been a good-sized powder and it had a poison label in addition to
the descriptive label. I should have thought that would have recalled
it to your memory.”

“So should I,” said Madeline. “But I don’t remember having bought any
powder that would be labelled ‘poison.’ It is very odd; and it is odd
that the paper should be there. I don’t usually put waste paper into
my cupboard.”

“Well, there it is,” said Miller; “but if you can’t remember anything
about it, we must see if the analysts can find out what was in it.”
With which he folded it and having put it into an envelope, bestowed
it in his pocket in company with his other treasures.

This was the last of the discoveries. When they had finished their
inspection of Madeline’s room the officers went on to Barbara’s, which
they examined with the same minute care as they had bestowed on the
others, but without bringing anything of interest to light. Then they
inspected the servants’ bedrooms and finally the kitchen and the other
premises appertaining to it, but still without result. It was a
tedious affair and we were all relieved when, at last, it came to an
end. Barbara and I escorted the two detectives to the street door, at
which the superintendent paused to make a few polite acknowledgments.

“I must thank you, Madam,” said he, “for the help you have given us
and for the kind and reasonable spirit in which you have accepted a
disagreeable necessity. I assure you that we do not usually meet with
so much consideration. A search of this kind is always an unpleasant
duty to carry out and it is not made any more pleasant by a hostile
attitude on the part of the persons concerned.”

“I can understand that,” replied Barbara; “but really the thanks are
due from me for the very courteous and considerate way in which you
have discharged what I am sure must be a most disagreeable duty. And
of course, it had to be; and I am glad that it has been done so
thoroughly. I never supposed that you would find what you are seeking
in this house. But it was necessary that the search should be made
here if only to prove that you must look for it somewhere else.”

“Quite so, Madam,” the superintendent returned, a little drily; “and
now I will wish you good afternoon and hope that we shall have no
further occasion to trouble you.”

As I closed the street door and turned back along the hall, the dining
room door—apparently already ajar—opened and Madeline and Wallingford
stepped out; and I could not help reflecting, as I noted their pale,
anxious faces and shaken bearing, how little their appearance
supported the confident, optimistic tone of Barbara’s last remarks.
But, at any rate, they were intensely relieved that the ordeal was
over, and Wallingford even showed signs of returning truculence.
Whatever he was going to say, however, was cut short by Barbara, who,
passing the door and moving towards the staircase, addressed me over
her shoulder.

“Do you mind coming up to my den, Rupert? I want to ask your advice
about one or two things.”

The request seemed a little inopportune; but it was uttered as a
command and I had no choice but to obey. Accordingly, I followed
Barbara up the stairs, leaving the other two in the hall, evidently
rather disconcerted by this sudden retreat. At the turn of the stairs
I looked down on the two pale faces. In Madeline’s I seemed to read a
new apprehensiveness, tinged with suspicion; on Wallingford’s a scowl
of furious anger which I had no patience to seek to interpret.



Chapter VIII

Thorndyke Speaks Bluntly

When I had entered the little sitting room and shut the door, I turned
to Barbara, awaiting with some curiosity what she had to say to me.
But for a while she said nothing, standing before me silently, and
looking at me with a most disquieting expression. All her calm
self-possession had gone. I could read nothing in her face but alarm
and dismay.

“It is dreadful, Rupert!” she exclaimed, at length, in a half-whisper.
“It is like some awful dream! What can it all mean? I don’t dare to
ask myself the question.”

I shook my head, for I was in precisely the same condition. I did not
dare to weigh the meaning of the things that I had seen and heard.

Suddenly, the stony fixity of her face relaxed and with a little,
smothered cry she flung her arm around my neck and buried her face on
my shoulder.

“Forgive me, Rupert, dearest, kindest friend,” she sobbed. “Suffer a
poor lonely woman for a few moments. I have only you, dear, faithful
one; only your strength and steadfastness to lean upon. Before the
others I must needs be calm and brave, must cloak my own fears to
support their flagging courage. But it is hard, Rupert; for they see
what we see and dare not put it into words. And the mystery, Rupert,
the horrible shadow that is over us all! In God’s name, what can it
all mean?”

“That is what I ask myself, Barbara, and dare not answer my own
question.”

She uttered a low moan and clung closer to me, sobbing quietly. I was
deeply moved, for I realized the splendid courage that enabled her to
go about this house of horror, calm and unafraid; to bear the burden
of her companions’ weakness as well as her own grief and humiliation.
But I could find nothing to say to her. I could only offer her a
silent sympathy, holding her head on my shoulder and softly stroking
her hair while I wondered dimly what the end of it all would be.

Presently she stood up, and, taking out her handkerchief, wiped her
eyes resolutely and finally.

“Thank you, dear Rupert,” she said, “for being so patient with me. I
felt that I had come to the end of my endurance and had to rest my
burden on you. It was a great relief. But I didn’t bring you up here
for that. I wanted to consult you about what has to be done. I can’t
look to poor Tony in his present state.”

“What is it that has to be done?” I asked.

“There is the funeral. That has still to take place.”

“Of course it has,” I exclaimed, suddenly taken aback; for amidst all
the turmoils and alarms, I had completely lost sight of this detail.
“I suppose I had better call on the undertaker and make the necessary
arrangements.”

“If you would be so kind, Rupert, and if you can spare the time. You
have given up the whole day to us already.”

“I can manage,” said I. “And as to the time of the funeral. I don’t
know whether it could be arranged for the evening. It gets dark pretty
early.”

“No, Rupert,” she exclaimed, firmly. “Not in the evening. Certainly
not. I will not have poor Harold’s body smuggled away in the dark like
the dishonoured corpse of some wretched suicide. The funeral shall
take place at the proper time, if I go with it alone.”

“Very well, Barbara. I will arrange for us to start at the time
originally fixed. I only suggested the evening because—well, you know
what to expect.”

“Yes, only too well! But I refuse to let a crowd of gaping sight-seers
intimidate me into treating my dead husband with craven disrespect.”

“Perhaps you are right,” said I with secret approval of her decision,
little as I relished the prospect that it opened. “Then I had better
go and make the arrangements at once. It is getting late. But I am
loath to leave you alone with Madeline and Wallingford.”

“I think, perhaps, we shall be better alone for the present, and you
have your own affairs to attend to. But you must have some food before
you go. You have had nothing since the morning, and I expect a meal is
ready by now.”

“I don’t think I will wait, Barbara,” I replied. “This affair ought to
be settled at once. I can get some food when I have dispatched the
business.”

She was reluctant to let me go. But I was suddenly conscious of a
longing to escape from this house into the world of normal things and
people; to be alone for a while with my own thoughts, and, above all,
to take counsel with Thorndyke. On my way out I called in at the
dining room to make my adieux to Madeline and Wallingford. The former
looked at me, as she shook my hand, very wistfully and I thought a
little reproachfully.

“I am sorry you have to go, Rupert,” she said. “But you will try to
come and see us to-morrow, won’t you? And spend as much time here as
you can.”

I promised to come at some time on the morrow; and having exchanged a
few words with Wallingford, took my departure, escorted to the street
door by the two women.

The closing of the door, sounding softly in my ears, conveyed a sense
of relief of which I felt ashamed. I drew a deep breath and stepped
forward briskly with a feeling of emancipation that I condemned as
selfish and disloyal even as I was sensible of its intensity. It was
almost with a sense of exhilaration that I strode along, a normal,
unnoticed wayfarer among ordinary men and women, enveloped by no cloud
of mystery, overhung by no shadow of crime. There was the undertaker,
indeed, who would drag me back into the gruesome environment, but I
would soon have finished with him, and then, for a time, at least, I
should be free.

I finished with him, in fact, sooner than I had expected, for he had
already arranged the procedure of the postponed funeral and required
only my assent; and when I had given this, I went my way breathing
more freely but increasingly conscious of the need for food.

Yet, after all, my escape was only from physical contact. Try as I
would to forget for a while the terrible events of this day of wrath,
the fresh memories of them came creeping back in the midst of those
other thoughts which I had generated by a deliberate effort. They
haunted me as I walked swiftly through the streets, they made
themselves heard above the rumble of the train, and even as I sat in a
tavern in Devereux Court, devouring with ravenous appreciation a
well-grilled chop, accompanied by a pint of claret, black care stood
behind the old-fashioned, high-backed settle, an unseen companion of
the friendly waiter.

The lighted windows of Thorndyke’s chambers were to my eyes as the
harbour lights to the eyes of a storm-beaten mariner. As I emerged
from Fig Tree Court and came in sight of them, I had already the
feeling that the burden of mystery and vague suspicion was lightened;
and I strode across King’s Bench Walk with the hopeful anticipation of
one who looks to shift his fardel on to more capable shoulders.

The door was opened by Thorndyke, himself; and the sheaf of papers in
his hand suggested that he was expecting me.

“Are those the depositions?” I asked as we shook hands.

“Yes,” he replied. “I have just been reading through them and making
an abstract. Holman has left the duplicate at your chambers.”

“I suppose the medical evidence represents the ‘complications’ that
you hinted at? You expected something of the kind?”

“Yes. An inquest in the face of a regular death certificate suggested
some pretty definite information; and then your own account of the
illness told one what to expect.”

“And yet,” said I, “neither of the doctors suspected anything while
the man was alive.”

“No; but that is not very remarkable. I had the advantage over them of
knowing that a death certificate had been challenged. It is always
easier to be wise after than before the event.”

“And now that you have read the depositions, what do you think of the
case? Do you think, for instance, that the verdict was justified?”

“Undoubtedly,” he replied. “What other verdict was possible on the
evidence that was before the court? The medical witness swore that
deceased died from the effects of arsenic poisoning. That is an
inference, it is true. The facts are that the man died and that a
poisonous quantity of arsenic was found in the body. But it is the
only reasonable inference and we cannot doubt that it is the true one.
Then again as to the question of murder as against accident or
suicide, it is one of probabilities. But the probabilities are so
overwhelmingly in favour of murder that no others are worth
considering. No, Mayfield, on the evidence before us, we have to
accept the verdict as expressing the obvious truth.”

“You think it impossible that there can be any error or fallacy in the
case?”

“I don’t say that,” he replied. “I am referring exclusively to the
evidence which is set forth in these depositions. That is all the
evidence that we possess. Apart from the depositions we have no
knowledge of the case at all; at least I have none, and I don’t
suppose you have any.”

“I have not. But I understand that you think it at least conceivable
that there may be, after all, some fallacy in the evidence of wilful
murder?”

“A fallacy,” he replied, “is always conceivable. As you know,
Mayfield, complete certainty, in the most rigorous sense, is hardly
ever attainable in legal practice. But we must be reasonable. The law
has to be administered; and if certainty, in the most extreme,
academic sense, is unattainable, we must be guided in our action by
the highest degree of probability that is within our reach.”

“Yes, I realize that. But still you admit that a fallacy is
conceivable. Can you, just for the sake of illustration, suggest any
such possibility in the evidence that you have read?”

“Well,” he replied, “as a matter of purely academic interest, there is
the point that I mentioned just now. The body of this man contained a
lethal quantity of arsenic. With that quantity of poison in his body,
the man died. The obvious inference is that those two facts were
connected as cause and effect. But it is not absolutely certain that
they were. It is conceivable that the man may have died from some
natural cause overlooked by the pathologist—who was already aware of
the presence of arsenic, from Detling’s information; or again it is
conceivable that the man may have been murdered in some other way—even
by the administration of some other, more rapidly acting poison, which
was never found because it was never looked for. These are undeniable
possibilities. But I doubt if any reasonable person would entertain
them, seeing that they are mere conjectures unsupported by any sort of
evidence. And you notice that the second possibility leaves the
verdict of wilful murder unaffected.”

“Yes, but it might transfer the effects of that verdict to the wrong
person.”

“True,” he rejoined with a smile. “It might transfer them from a
poisoner who had committed a murder to another poisoner who had only
attempted to commit one; and the irony of the position would be that
the latter would actually believe himself to be the murderer. But as I
said, this is mere academic talk. The coroner’s verdict is the reality
with which we have to deal.”

“I am not so sure of that, Thorndyke,” said I, inspired with a sudden
hope by his “illustration.” “You admit that fallacies are possible and
you are able to suggest two off-hand. You insist, very properly, that
our opinions at present must be based exclusively on the evidence
given at the inquest. But, as I listened to that evidence, I had the
feeling—and I have it still—that it did not give a credible
explanation of the facts that were proved. I had—and have—the feeling
that careful and competent investigation might bring to light some
entirely new evidence.”

“It is quite possible,” he admitted, rather drily.

“Well, then,” I pursued, “I should wish some such investigation to be
made. I can recall a number of cases in which the available evidence,
as in the present case, appeared to point to a certain definite
conclusion, but in which investigations undertaken by you brought out
a body of new evidence pointing in a totally different direction.
There was the Hornby case, the case of Blackmore, deceased, the
Bellingham case and a number of others in which the result of your
investigations was to upset completely a well-established case against
some suspected individual.”

He nodded, but made no comment, and I concluded with the question:

“Well, why should not a similar result follow in the present case?”

He reflected for a few moments and then asked:

“What is it that is in your mind, Mayfield? What, exactly do you
propose?”

“I am proposing that you should allow me to retain you on my own
behalf and that of other interested parties to go thoroughly into this
case.”

“With what object?”

“With the object of bringing to light the real facts connected with
the death of Harold Monkhouse.”

“Are you authorized by any of the interested parties to make this
proposal?”

“No; and perhaps I had better leave them out and make the proposal on
my own account only.”

He did not reply immediately but sat looking at me steadily with a
rather inscrutable expression which I found a little disturbing. At
length he spoke, with unusual deliberation and emphasis.

“Are you sure, Mayfield, that you want the real facts brought to
light?”

I stared at him, startled and a good deal taken aback by his question,
and especially by the tone in which it was put.

“But, surely,” I stammered, in reply. “Why not?”

“Don’t be hasty, Mayfield,” said he. “Reflect calmly and impartially
before you commit yourself to any course of action of which you cannot
foresee the consequences. Perhaps I can help you. Shall we, without
prejudice and without personal bias, take a survey of the _status quo_
and try to see exactly where we stand?”

“By all means,” I replied, a little uncomfortably.

“Well,” he said, “the position is this. A man has died in a certain
house, to which he has been confined as an invalid for some
considerable time. The cause of his death is stated to be poisoning by
arsenic. That statement is made by a competent medical witness who has
had the fullest opportunity to ascertain the facts. He makes the
statement with complete confidence that it is a true statement, and
his opinion is supported by those of two other competent professional
witnesses. It is an established fact, which cannot be contested, that
the body of deceased contained sufficient arsenic to cause his death.
So far as we can see, there is not the slightest reason to doubt that
the man died from arsenical poisoning.

“When we come to the question, ‘How did the arsenic find its way into
the man’s body?’ there appears to be only one possible answer. Suicide
and accident are clearly excluded. The evidence makes it practically
certain that the poison was administered to him by some person or
persons with the intent to compass his death; and the circumstances in
which the poisoning occurred make it virtually certain that the
arsenic was administered to this man by some person or persons
customarily and intimately in contact with him.

“The evidence shows that there were eight persons who would answer
this description; and we have no knowledge of the existence of any
others. Those persons are: Barbara Monkhouse, Madeline Norris, Anthony
Wallingford, the housemaid, Mabel Withers, the cook, the kitchen-maid,
Dr. Dimsdale and Rupert Mayfield. Of these eight persons the police
will assume that one, or more, administered the poison; and, so far as
we can see, the police are probably right.”

I was rather staggered by his bluntness. But I had asked for his
opinion and I had got it. After a brief pause, I said:

“We are still, of course, dealing with the depositions. On those, as
you say, a presumption of guilt lies against these eight persons
collectively. That doesn’t carry us very far in a legal sense. You
can’t indict eight persons as having among them the guilty party. Do
you take it that the presumption of guilt lies more heavily on some of
these persons than on others?”

“Undoubtedly,” he replied. “I enumerated them merely as the body of
persons who fulfilled the necessary conditions as to opportunity and
among whom the police will—reasonably—look for the guilty person. In a
sense, they are all suspect until the guilt is fixed on a particular
person. They all had, technically, a motive, since they all benefited
by the death of deceased. Actually, none of them has been shown to
have any motive at all in an ordinary and reasonable sense. But for
practical purposes, several of them can almost be put outside the area
of suspicion; the kitchen-maid, for instance, and Dr. Dimsdale and
yourself.”

“And Mrs. Monkhouse,” I interposed, “seeing that she appears to have
been absent and far away on each occasion when the poison seems to
have been administered.”

“Precisely,” he agreed. “In fact, her absence would seem to exclude
her from the group of possible suspects. But apart from its bearing on
herself, her absence from home on these occasions has a rather
important bearing on some of the others.”

“Indeed!” said I, trying rapidly to judge what that bearing might be.

“Yes, it is this: the fact that the poisoning occurred—as it
appears—only when Mrs. Monkhouse was away from home, suggests not only
that the poisoner was fully cognizant of her movements, which all the
household would be, but that her presence at home would have hindered
that poisoner from administering the poison. Now, the different
persons in the house would be differently affected by her presence. We
need not pursue the matter any further just now, but you must see that
the hindrance to the poisoning caused by Mrs. Monkhouse’s presence
would be determined by the nature of the relations between Mrs.
Monkhouse and the poisoner.”

“Yes, I see that.”

“And you see that this circumstance tends to confirm the belief that
the crime was committed by a member of the household?”

“I suppose it does,” I admitted, grudgingly.

“It does, certainly,” said Thorndyke; “and that being so, I ask you
again: do you think it expedient that you should meddle with this
case? If you do, you will be taking a heavy responsibility; for I must
remind you that you are not proposing to employ me as a counsel, but
as an investigator who may become a witness. Now, when I plead in
court, I act like any other counsel; I plead my client’s case frankly
as an advocate, knowing that the judge is there to watch over the
interests of justice. But as an investigator or witness I am concerned
only with the truth. I never give ex parte evidence. If I investigate
a crime and discover the criminal, I denounce him, even though he is
my employer; for otherwise I should become an accessory. Whoever
employs me as an investigator of crime does so at his own risk.

“Bear this in mind, Mayfield, before you go any further in this
matter. I don’t know what your relations are to these people, but I
gather that they are your friends; and I want you to consider very
seriously whether you are prepared to risk the possible consequences
of employing me. It is actually possible that one or more of these
persons may be indicted for the murder of Harold Monkhouse. That
would, in any case, be extremely painful for you. But if it happened
through the action of the police, you would be, after all, but a
passive spectator of the catastrophe. Very different would be the
position if it were your own hand that had let the axe fall. Are you
prepared to face the risk of such a possibility?”

I must confess that I was daunted by Thorndyke’s blunt statement of
the position. There was no doubt as to the view that he took of the
case. He made no secret of it. And he clearly gauged my own state of
mind correctly. He saw that it was not the crime that was concerning
me; that I was not seeking justice against the murderer but that I was
looking to secure the safety of my friends.

I turned the question over rapidly in my mind. The contingency that
Thorndyke had suggested was horrible. I could not face such a risk.
Rather, by far, would I have had the murderer remain unpunished than
be, myself, the agent of vengeance on any of these suspects. Hideous
as the crime was, I could not bring myself to accept the office of
executioner if one of my own friends was to be the victim.

I had almost decided to abandon the project and leave the result to
Fate or the police. But then came a sudden revulsion. From the grounds
of suspicion my thoughts flew to the persons suspected; to gentle,
sympathetic Madeline, so mindful of the dead man’s comfort, so
solicitous about his needs, so eager to render him the little services
that mean so much to a sick man. Could I conceive of her as hiding
under this appearance of tender sympathy the purposes of a cruel and
callous murderess? The thing was absurd. My heart rejected it utterly.
Nor could I entertain for a moment such a thought of the kindly,
attentive housemaid; and even Wallingford, much as I disliked him, was
obviously outside the area of possible suspicion. An intolerable
coxcomb he certainly was; but a murderer—never!

“I will take the risk, Thorndyke,” said I.

He looked at me with slightly raised eyebrows, and I continued:

“I know these people pretty intimately and I find it impossible to
entertain the idea that any of them could have committed this callous,
deliberate crime. At the moment, I realize circumstances seem to
involve them in suspicion; but I am certain that there is some
fallacy—that there are some facts which did not transpire at the
inquest but which might be brought to the surface if you took the case
in hand.”

“Why not let the police disinter those facts?”

“Because the police evidently suspect the members of the household and
they will certainly pursue the obvious probabilities.”

“So should I, for that matter,” said he; “and in any case, we can’t
prevent the police from bringing a charge if they are satisfied that
they can support it. And your own experience will tell you that they
will certainly not take a case into the Central Criminal Court unless
they have enough evidence to make a conviction a virtual certainty.
But I remind you, Mayfield, that they have got it all to do. There is
grave suspicion in respect of a number of persons, but there is not,
at present, a particle of positive evidence against any one person. It
looks to me as if it might turn out to be a very elusive case.”

“Precisely,” said I. “That is why I am anxious that the actual
perpetrator should be discovered. Until he is, all these people will
be under suspicion, with the peril of a possible arrest constantly
hanging over them. I might even say, ‘hanging over us’; for you,
yourself, have included me in the group of possible suspects.”

He reflected for a few moments. At length he replied:

“You are quite right, Mayfield. Until the perpetrator of a crime is
discovered and his guilt established, it is always possible for
suspicion to rest upon the innocent and even for a miscarriage of
justice to occur. In all cases it is most desirable that the crime
should be brought home to the actual perpetrator without delay for
that reason, to say nothing of the importance, on grounds of public
policy, of exposing and punishing wrong-doers. You know these people
and I do not. If you are sufficiently confident of their innocence to
take the risk of associating yourself with the agencies of detection,
I have no more to say on that point. I am quite willing to go into the
case so far as I can, though, at present, I see no prospect of
success.”

“It seems to you a difficult case, then?”

“Very. It is extraordinarily obscure and confused. Whoever poisoned
that unfortunate man, seems to have managed most skilfully to confuse
all the issues. Whatever may have been the medium through which the
poison was given, that medium is associated equally with a number of
different persons. If the medicine was the vehicle, then the
responsibility is divided between Dimsdale, who prepared it, and the
various persons who administered it. If the poison was mixed with the
food, it may have been introduced by any of the persons who prepared
it or had access to it on its passage from the kitchen to the
patient’s bedroom. There is no one person of whom we can say that he
or she had any special opportunity that others had not. And it is the
same with the motive. No one had any really, adequate motive for
killing Monkhouse; but all the possible suspects benefited by his
death, though they were apparently not aware of it.”

“They all knew, in general terms, that they had been mentioned in the
will though the actual provisions and amounts were not disclosed. But
I should hardly describe Mrs. Monkhouse as benefiting by her husband’s
death. She will not be as well off now as she was when he was alive
and the whole of his income was available.”

“No. But we were not including her in the group since she was not in
the house when the poison was being administered. We were speaking of
those who actually had the opportunity to administer the poison; and
we see that the opportunity was approximately equal in all. And you
see, Mayfield, the trouble is that any evidence incriminating any one
person would be in events which are past and beyond recall. The
depositions contain all that we know and all that we are likely to
know, unless the police are able to ascertain that some one of the
parties has purchased arsenic from a chemist; which is extremely
unlikely considering the caution and judgment that the poisoner has
shown. The truth is that, if no new evidence is forthcoming, the
murder of Harold Monkhouse will take its place among the unsolved and
insoluble mysteries.”

“Then, I take it that you will endeavour to find some new evidence?
But I don’t see, at all, how you will go about it.”

“Nor do I,” said he. “There seems to be nothing to investigate.
However, I shall study the depositions and see if a careful
consideration of the evidence offers any suggestion for a new line of
research. And as the whole case now lies in the past, I shall try to
learn as much as possible about everything and everybody concerned.
Perhaps I had better begin with you. I don’t quite understand what
your position is in this household.”

“I will tell you with pleasure all about my relations with the
Monkhouses, but it is a rather long story, and I don’t see that it
will help you in any way.”

“Now, Mayfield,” said Thorndyke, “don’t begin by considering what
knowledge may or may not be helpful. We don’t know. The most trivial
or seemingly irrelevant fact may offer a most illuminating suggestion.
My rule is, when I am gravelled for lack of evidence, to collect,
indiscriminately, all the information that I can obtain that is in the
remotest way connected with the problem that I am dealing with. Bear
that in mind. I want to know all that you can tell me, and don’t be
afraid of irrelevant details. They may not be irrelevant, after all;
and if they are, I can sift them out afterwards. Now, begin at the
beginning and tell me the whole of the long story.”

He provided himself with a note-book, uncapped his fountain pen and
prepared himself to listen to what I felt to be a perfectly useless
recital of facts that could have no possible bearing on the case.

“I will take you at your word,” said I, “and begin at the very
beginning, when I was quite a small boy. At that time, my father, who
was a widower, lived at Highgate and kept the chambers in the Temple
which I now occupy. A few doors away from us lived a certain Mr.
Keene, an old friend of my father’s—his only really intimate friend,
in fact—and, of course, I used to see a good deal of him. Mr. Keene,
who was getting on in years, had married a very charming woman,
considerably younger than himself, and at this time there was one
child, a little girl about two years old. Unfortunately, Mrs. Keene
was very delicate, and soon after the child’s birth she developed
symptoms of consumption. Once started, the disease progressed rapidly
in spite of the most careful treatment, and in about two years from
the outset of the symptoms, she died.

“Her death was a great grief to Mr. Keene, and indeed, to us all, for
she was a most lovable woman; and the poor little motherless child
made the strongest appeal to our sympathies. She was the loveliest
little creature imaginable and as sweet and winning in nature as she
was charming in appearance. On her mother’s death, I adopted her as my
little sister, and devoted myself to her service. In fact, I became
her slave; but a very willing slave; for she was so quick and
intelligent, so affectionate and so amiable that, in spite of the
difference in our ages—some eight or nine years—I found her a
perfectly satisfying companion. She entered quite competently into all
my boyish sports and amusements, so that our companionship really
involved very little sacrifice on my part but rather was a source of
constant pleasure.

“But her motherless condition caused Mr. Keene a good deal of anxiety.
As I have said, he was getting on in life and was by no means a strong
man, and he viewed with some alarm the, not very remote, possibility
of her becoming an orphan with no suitable guardian, for my father was
now an elderly man, and I was, as yet, too young to undertake the
charge. Eventually, he decided, for the child’s sake, to marry again;
and about two years after his first wife’s death he proposed to and
was accepted by a lady named Ainsworth whom he had known for many
years, who had been left a widow with one child, a girl some two years
younger than myself.

“Naturally, I viewed the advent of the new Mrs. Keene with some
jealousy. But there was no occasion. She was a good, kindly woman who
showed from the first that she meant to do her duty by her little
step-daughter. And her own child, Barbara, equally disarmed our
jealousy. A quiet, rather reserved little girl, but very clever and
quick-witted, she not only accepted me at once with the frankest
friendliness but, with a curious tactfulness for such a young girl,
devoted herself to my little friend, Stella Keene, without in the
least attempting to oust me from my position. In effect, we three
young people became a most united and harmonious little coterie in
which our respective positions were duly recognized. I was the head of
the firm, so to speak, Stella was my adopted sister, and Barbara was
the ally of us both.

“So our relations continued as the years passed; but presently the
passing years began to take toll of our seniors. My father was the
first to go. Then followed Mr. Keene, and after a few more years,
Barbara’s mother. By the time my twenty-fifth birthday came round, we
were all orphans.”

“What were your respective ages then?” Thorndyke asked.

Rather surprised at the question, I paused to make a calculation.

“My own age,” I replied, “was, as I have said, twenty-five. Barbara
would then be twenty-two and Stella sixteen.”

Thorndyke made a note of my answer and I proceeded:

“The death of our elders made no appreciable difference in our way of
living. My father had left me a modest competence and the two girls
were fairly provided for. The houses that we occupied were beyond our
needs, reduced as we were in numbers and we discussed the question of
sharing a house. But, of course, the girls were not really my sisters
and the scheme was eventually rejected as rather too unconventional;
so we continued to live in our respective houses.”

“Was there any trustee for the girls?” Thorndyke asked.

“Yes, Mr. Brodribb. The bulk of the property was, I believe, vested in
Stella, but, for reasons which I shall come to in a moment, there was
a provision that, in the event of her death, it should revert to
Barbara.”

“On account, I presume, of the tendency to consumption?”

“Exactly. For some time before Mr. Keene’s death there had been signs
that Stella inherited her mother’s delicacy of health. Hence the
provisions for Barbara. But no definite manifestations of disease
appeared until Stella was about eighteen. Then she developed a cough
and began to lose weight; but, for a couple of years the disease made
no very marked progress, in fact, there were times when she seemed to
be in a fair way to recovery. Then, rather suddenly, her health took a
turn for the worse. Soon she became almost completely bed-ridden. She
wasted rapidly, and, in fact, was now the typical consumptive, hectic,
emaciated, but always bright, cheerful and full of plans for the
future and enthusiasm for the little hobbies that I devised to keep
her amused.

“But all the time, she was going down the hill steadily, although, as
I have said, there were remissions and fluctuations; and, in short,
after about a year’s definite illness, she went the way of her mother.
Her death was immediately caused, I understand, by an attack of
hemorrhage.”

“You understand?” Thorndyke repeated, interrogatively.

“Yes. To my lasting grief, I was away from home when she died. I had
been recently called to the bar and was offered a brief for the
Chelmsford Assizes, which I felt I ought not to refuse, especially as
Stella seemed, just then, to be better than usual. What made it worse
was that the telegram which was sent to recall me went astray. I had
moved on to Ipswich and had only just written to give my new address,
so that I did not get home until just before the funeral. It was a
fearful shock, for no one had the least suspicion that the end was so
near. If I had supposed that there was the slightest immediate danger,
nothing on earth would have induced me to go away from home.”

Thorndyke had listened to my story not only with close attention but
with an expression of sympathy which I noted gratefully and perhaps
with a little surprise. But he was a strange man; as impersonal as
Fate when he was occupied in actual research and yet showing at times
unexpected gleams of warm human feeling and the most sympathetic
understanding. He now preserved a thoughtful silence for some time
after I had finished. Presently he said:

“I suppose this poor girl’s death caused a considerable change in your
way of living?”

“Yes, indeed! Its effects were devastating both on Barbara and me.
Neither of us felt that we could go on with the old ways of life.
Barbara let her house and went into rooms in London, where I used to
visit her as often as I could; and I sold my house, furniture and all
and took up residence in the Temple. But even that I could not endure
for long. Stella’s death had broken me up completely. Right on from my
boyhood, she had been the very hub of my life. All my thoughts and
interests had revolved around her. She had been to me friend and
sister in one. Now that she was gone, the world seemed to be a great,
chilly void, haunted everywhere by memories of her. She had pervaded
my whole life, and everything about me was constantly reminding me of
her. At last I found that I could bear it no longer. The familiar
things and places became intolerable to my eyes. I did not want to
forget her; on the contrary, I loved to cherish her memory. But it was
harrowing to have my loss thrust upon me at every turn. I yearned for
new surroundings in which I could begin a new life; and in the end, I
decided to go to Canada and settle down there to practise at the Bar.

“My decision came as a fearful blow to Barbara, and indeed, I felt not
a little ashamed of my disloyalty to her; for she, too, had been like
a sister to me and, next to Stella, had been my dearest friend. But it
could not be helped. An intolerable unrest had possession of me. I
felt that I must go; and go I did, leaving poor Barbara to console her
loneliness with her political friends.

“I stayed in Canada nearly two years and meant to stay there for good.
Then, one day, I got a letter from Barbara telling me that she was
married. The news rather surprised me, for I had taken Barbara for an
inveterate spinster with a tendency to avoid male friends other than
myself. But the news had another, rather curious effect. It set my
thoughts rambling amidst the old surroundings. And now I found that
they repelled me no longer; that, on the contrary, they aroused a
certain feeling of home-sickness, a yearning for the fuller, richer
life of London and a sight of the English countryside. In not much
more than a month, I had wound up my Canadian affairs and was back in
my old chambers in the Temple, which I had never given up, ready to
start practice afresh.”

“That,” said Thorndyke, “would be a little less than three years ago.
Now we come to your relations with the Monkhouse establishment.”

“Yes; and I drifted into them almost at once. Barbara received me with
open arms, and of course, Monkhouse knew all about me and accepted me
as an old friend. Very soon I found myself, in a way, a member of the
household. A bedroom was set apart for my use, whenever I cared to
occupy it, and I came and went as if I were one of the family. I was
appointed a trustee, with Brodribb, and dropped into the position of
general family counsellor.”

“And what were your relations with Monkhouse?”

“We were never very intimate. I liked the man and I think he liked me.
But he was not very approachable; a self-contained, aloof,
undemonstrative man, and an inveterate book-worm. But he was a good
man and I respected him profoundly, though I could never understand
why Barbara married him, or why he married Barbara. I couldn’t imagine
him in love. On the other hand I cannot conceive any motive that any
one could have had for doing him any harm. He seemed to me to be
universally liked in a rather lukewarm fashion.”

“It is of no use, I suppose,” said Thorndyke, “to ask you if these
reminiscences have brought anything to your mind that would throw any
light on the means, the motive or the person connected with the
crime?”

“No,” I answered; “nor can I imagine that they will bring anything to
yours. In fact, I am astonished that you have let me go on so long
dribbling out all these trivial and irrelevant details. Your patience
is monumental.”

“Not at all,” he replied. “Your story has interested me deeply. It
enables me to visualize very clearly at least a part of the setting of
this crime, and it has introduced me to the personalities of some of
the principal actors, including yourself. The details are not in the
least trivial; and whether they are or are not irrelevant we cannot
judge. Perhaps, when we have solved the mystery—if ever we do—we may
find connections between events that had seemed to be totally
unrelated.”

“It is, I suppose, conceivable as a mere, speculative possibility. But
what I have been telling you is mainly concerned with my own rather
remote past, which can hardly have any possible bearing on
comparatively recent events.”

“That is perfectly true,” Thorndyke agreed. “Your little autobiography
has made perfectly clear your own relation to these people, but it has
left most of them—and those in whom I am most interested—outside the
picture. I was just wondering whether it would be possible for you to
amplify your sketch of the course of events after Barbara’s marriage—I
am, like you, using the Christian name, for convenience. What I really
want is an account of the happenings in that household during the last
three years, and especially during the last year. Do you think that,
if you were to turn out the garrets of your memory, you could draw up
a history of the house in Hilborough Square and its inmates from the
time when you first made its acquaintance? Have you any sort of notes
that would help you?”

“By Jove!” I exclaimed. “Of course I have. There is my diary.”

“Oh,” said Thorndyke, with obviously awakened interest. “You keep a
diary. What sort of diary is it? Just brief jottings, or a full
record?”

“It is a pretty full diary. I began it more than twenty years ago as a
sort of schoolboy hobby. But it turned out so useful and entertaining
to refer to that I encouraged myself to persevere. Now, I am a
confirmed diarist; and I write down not only facts and events, but
also comments, which may be quite illuminating to study by the light
of what has happened. I will read over the last three years and make
an abstract of everything that has happened in that household. And I
hope the reading of that abstract will entertain you; for I can’t
believe that it will help you to unravel the mystery of Harold
Monkhouse’s death.”

“Well,” Thorndyke replied, as I rose to take my leave, “don’t let your
scepticism influence you. Keep in your mind the actual position. In
that house a man was poisoned, and almost certainly feloniously
poisoned. He must have been poisoned either by some one who was an
inmate of that house or by some one who had some sort of access to the
dead man from without. It is conceivable that the entries in your
diary may bring one or other such person into view. Keep that
possibility constantly before you; and fill your abstract with
irrelevancies rather than risk omitting anything from which we could
gather even the most shadowy hint.”



Chapter IX

Superintendent Miller is Puzzled

On arriving at my chambers after my conference with Thorndyke I found
awaiting me a letter from a Maidstone solicitor offering me a brief
for a case of some importance that was to be tried at the forthcoming
assizes. At first, I read it almost impatiently, so preoccupied was my
mind with the tragedy in which I was involved. It seemed inopportune,
almost impertinent. But, in fact it was most opportune, as I presently
realized, in that it recalled me to the realities of normal life. My
duties to my friends I did, indeed, take very seriously. But I was not
an idle man. I had my way to make in my profession and could not
afford to drop out of the race, to sacrifice my ambitions entirely,
even on the altar of friendship.

I sat down and glanced through the instructions. It was a case of
alleged fraud, an intricate case which interested me at once and in
which I thought I could do myself credit; which was also the opinion
of the solicitor, who was evidently anxious for me to undertake it.
Eventually, I decided to accept the brief, and having written a letter
to that effect, I set myself to spend the remainder of the evening in
studying the instructions and mastering the rather involved details.
For time was short, since the case was down for hearing in a couple of
days’ time and the morrow would be taken up by my engagements at
Hilborough Square.

I pass over the incidents of the funeral. It was a dismal and
unpleasant affair, lacking all the dignity and pathos that relieve the
dreariness of an ordinary funeral. None of us could forget, as we sat
back in the mourning coach as far out of sight as possible, that the
corpse in the hearse ahead was the corpse of a murdered man, and that
most of the bystanders knew it. Even in the chapel, the majestic
service was marred and almost vulgarized by the self-consciousness of
the mourners and at the grave-side we found one another peering
furtively around for signs of recognition. To all of us it was a
profound relief, when we were once more gathered together in the
drawing room, to hear the street door close finally and the mourning
carriage rumble away down the square.

I took an early opportunity of mentioning the brief and I could see
that to both the women the prospect of my departure came as a
disagreeable surprise.

“How soon will you have to leave us?” Madeline asked, anxiously.

“I must start for Maidstone to-morrow morning,” I replied.

“Oh, dear!” she exclaimed. “How empty the place will seem and how lost
we shall be without you to advise us.”

“I hope,” said I, “that the occasions for advice are past, and I shall
not be so very far away, if you should want to consult me.”

“No,” said Barbara, “and I suppose you will not be away for very long.
Shall you come back when your case is finished or shall you stay for
the rest of the assizes?”

“I shall probably have some other briefs offered, which will detain me
until the assizes are over. My solicitor hinted at some other cases,
and of course there is the usual casual work that turns up on
circuit.”

“Well,” she rejoined, “we can only wish you good luck and plenty of
work, though we shall be glad when it is time for you to come back;
and we must be thankful that you were here to help us through the
worst of our troubles.”

The general tenor of this conversation, which took place at the lunch
table, was not, apparently, to Wallingford’s taste; for he sat glumly
consuming his food and rather ostentatiously abstaining from taking
any part in the discussion. Nor was I surprised; for the obvious way
in which both women leant on me was a reproach to his capacity, which
ought to have made my advice and guidance unnecessary. But though I
sympathized in a way with his displeasure, it nevertheless made me a
little uneasy. For there was another matter that I wanted to broach;
one in which he might consider himself concerned; namely, my
commission to Thorndyke. I had, indeed, debated with myself whether I
should not be wiser to keep my own counsel on the subject; but I had
decided that they were all interested parties and that it would seem
unfriendly and uncandid to keep them in the dark. But, for obvious
reasons, I did not propose to acquaint them with Thorndyke’s views on
the case.

The announcement, when I made it, was received without enthusiasm, and
Wallingford, as I had feared, was inclined to be resentful.

“Don’t you think, Mayfield,” said he, “that you ought to have
consulted the rest of us before putting this private inquiry agent, or
whatever he is, on the case?”

“Perhaps I ought,” I admitted. “But it is important to us all that the
mystery should be cleared up.”

“That is quite true,” said Barbara, “and for my part, I shall never
rest until the wretch who made away with poor Harold is dragged out
into the light of day—that is, if there is really such a person; I
mean, if Harold’s death was not, after all, the result of some ghastly
accident. But is it wise for us to meddle? The police have the case in
hand. Surely, with all their experience and their machinery of
detection, they are more likely to be successful than a private
individual, no matter how clever he may be.”

“That,” I replied, “is, in fact, Dr. Thorndyke’s own view. He wished
to leave the inquiry to the police; and I may say that he will not
come into the case unless it should turn out that the police are
unable to solve the mystery.”

“In which case,” said Wallingford, “it is extremely unlikely that an
outsider, without their special opportunities, will be able to solve
it. And if he should happen to find a mare’s nest, we shall share the
glory and the publicity of his discovery.”

“I don’t think,” said I, “that you need have any anxiety on that
score. Dr. Thorndyke is not at all addicted to finding mare’s nests
and still less to publicity. If he makes any discovery he will
probably keep it to himself until he has the whole case cut and dried.
Then he will communicate the facts to the police; and the first news
we shall have on the subject will be the announcement that an arrest
has been made. And when the police make an arrest on Thorndyke’s
information, you can take it that a conviction will follow
inevitably.”

“I don’t think I quite understand Dr. Thorndyke’s position,” said
Madeline. “What is he? You seem to refer to him as a sort of superior
private detective.”

“Thorndyke,” I replied, “is a unique figure in the legal world. He is
a barrister and a doctor of medicine. In the one capacity he is
probably the greatest criminal lawyer of our time. In the other he is,
among other things, the leading authority on poisons and on crimes
connected with them; and so far as I know, he has never made a
mistake.”

“He must be a very remarkable man,” Wallingford remarked, drily.

“He is,” I replied; and in justification of my statement, I gave a
sketch of one or two of the cases in which Thorndyke had cleared up
what had seemed to be a completely and helplessly insoluble mystery.
They all listened with keen interest and were evidently so far
impressed that any doubts as to Thorndyke’s capacity were set at rest.
But yet I was conscious, in all three, of a certain distrust and
uneasiness. The truth was, as it seemed to me, that none of them had
yet recovered from the ordeal of the inquest. In their secret hearts,
what they all wanted—even Barbara, as I suspected—was to bury the
whole dreadful episode in oblivion. And seeing this, I had not the
courage to remind them of their—of our position as the actual
suspected parties whose innocence it was Thorndyke’s function to make
clear.

In view of my impending departure from London, I stayed until the
evening was well advanced, though sensible of a certain impatience to
be gone; and when, at length, I took my leave and set forth homeward,
I was conscious of the same sense of relief that I had felt on the
previous day. Now, for a time, I could dismiss this horror from my
mind and let my thoughts occupy themselves with the activities that
awaited me at Maidstone; which they did so effectually that by the
time I reached my chambers, I felt that I had my case at my fingers’
ends.

I had just set to work making my preparations for the morrow when my
glance happened to light on the glazed bookcase in which the long
series of my diaries was kept; and then I suddenly bethought me of the
abstract which I had promised to make for Thorndyke. There would be no
time for that now; and yet, since he had seemed to attach some
importance to it, I could not leave my promise unfulfilled. The only
thing to be done was to let him have the diary, itself. I was a little
reluctant to do this for I had never yet allowed any one to read it.
But there seemed to be no alternative; and, after all, Thorndyke was a
responsible person; and if the diary did contain a certain amount of
confidential matter, there was nothing in it that was really secret or
that I need object to any one reading. Accordingly, I took out the
current volume, and, dropping it into my pocket, made my way round to
King’s Bench Walk.

My knock at the door was answered by Thorndyke, himself, and as I
entered the room, I was a little disconcerted at finding a large man
seated in an easy chair by the fire with his back to me; and still
more so when, on hearing me enter, he rose and turned to confront me.
For the stranger was none other than Mr. Superintendent Miller.

His gratification at the meeting seemed to be no greater than mine,
though he greeted me quite courteously and even cordially. I had the
uncomfortable feeling that I had broken in on a conference and began
to make polite preparations for a strategic retreat. But Thorndyke
would have none of it.

“Not at all, Mayfield,” said he. “The superintendent is here on the
same business as you are, and when I tell him that you have
commissioned me to investigate this case, he will realize that we are
colleagues.”

I am not sure that the superintendent realized this so very vividly,
but it was evident that Thorndyke’s information interested him.
Nevertheless he waited for me and Thorndyke to make the opening moves
and only relaxed his caution by slow degrees.

“We were remarking when you came in,” he said, at length, “what a
curiously baffling case this is, and how very disappointing. At first
it looked all plain sailing. There was the lady who used to prepare
the special diet for the unfortunate man and actually take it up to
him and watch him eat it. It seemed as if we had her in the hollow of
our hand. And then she slipped out. The arsenic that was found in the
stomach seemed to connect the death with the food; but then there was
that confounded bottle of medicine that seemed to put the food outside
the case. And when we came to reckon up the evidence furnished by the
medicine, it proved nothing. Somebody put the poison in. All of them
had the opportunity, more or less, and all about equally. Nothing
pointed to one more than another. And that is how it is all through.
There is any amount of suspicion; but the suspicion falls on a group
of people, not on any one in particular.”

“Yes,” said Thorndyke, “the issues are most strangely confused.”

“Extraordinarily,” said Miller. “This queer confusion runs all through
the case. You are constantly thinking that you have got the solution,
and just as you are perfectly sure, it slips through your fingers.
There are lots of clues—fine ones; but as soon as you follow one up it
breaks off in the middle and leaves you gaping. You saw what happened
at the search, Mr. Mayfield.”

“I saw the beginning—the actual search; but I don’t know what came of
it.”

“Then I can tell you in one word. Nothing. And yet we seemed to be
right on the track every time. There was that secret drawer of Mr.
Wallingford’s. When I saw that packet of white powder in it, I thought
it was going to be a walk-over. I didn’t believe for a moment that the
stuff was cocaine. But it was. I went straight to our analyst to have
it tested.”

As the superintendent was speaking I caught Thorndyke’s eye, fixed on
me with an expression of reproachful inquiry. But he made no remark
and Miller continued: “Then there were those two empty bottles. The
one that I found in the library yielded definite traces of arsenic.
But then, whose bottle was it? The place was accessible to the entire
household. It was impossible to connect it with any one person. On the
other hand, the bottle that I found in Miss Norris’s cupboard, and
that was presumably hers—though she didn’t admit it—contained no
arsenic; at least the analyst said it didn’t, though as it smelt of
lavender and had a red stain at the bottom, I feel convinced that it
had had Fowler’s Solution in it. What do you think, Doctor? Don’t you
think the analyst may have been mistaken?”

“No,” Thorndyke replied, decidedly. “If the red stain had been due to
Fowler’s Solution there would have been an appreciable quantity of
arsenic present; probably a fiftieth of a grain at least. But Marsh’s
test would detect a much smaller quantity than that. If no arsenic was
found by a competent chemist who was expressly testing for it, you can
take it that no arsenic was there.”

“Well,” Miller rejoined, “you know best. But you must admit that it is
a most remarkable thing that one bottle which smelt of lavender and
had a red stain at the bottom, should contain arsenic, and that
another bottle, exactly similar in appearance and smelling of lavender
and having a red stain at the bottom, should contain no arsenic.”

“I am entirely with you, Miller,” Thorndyke agreed. “It is a most
remarkable circumstance.”

“And you see my point,” said Miller. “Every discovery turns out a
sell. I find a concealed packet of powder—with the owner lying like
Ananias—but the powder turns out not to be arsenic. I find a bottle
that did contain arsenic, and there is no owner. I find another,
similar bottle, which has an owner, and there is no arsenic in it.
Rum, isn’t it? I feel like the donkey with the bunch of carrots tied
to his nose. The carrots are there all right, but he can never get a
bite at ’em.”

Thorndyke had listened with the closest attention to the
superintendent’s observations and he now began a cautious
cross-examination—cautious because Miller was taking it for granted
that I had told him all about the search; and I could not but admire
his discretion in suppressing the fact that I had not. For, while
Thorndyke, himself, would not suspect me of any intentional
concealment, Miller undoubtedly would, and what little confidence he
had in me would have been destroyed. Accordingly, he managed the
superintendent so adroitly that the latter described, piecemeal, all
the incidents of the search.

“Did Wallingford say how he came to be in possession of all this
cocaine and morphine?” he asked.

“No,” replied Miller. “I asked him, but he refused to say where he had
got it.”

“But he could be made to answer,” said Thorndyke. “Both of these drugs
are poisons. He could be made to account for having them in his
possession and could be called upon to show that he came by them
lawfully. They are not ordinarily purchasable by the public.”

“No, that’s true,” Miller admitted. “But is there any object in going
into the question? You see, the cocaine isn’t really any affair of
ours.”

“It doesn’t seem to be,” Thorndyke agreed, “at least, not directly;
but indirectly it may be of considerable importance. I think you ought
to find out where he got that cocaine and morphine, Miller.”

The superintendent reflected with the air of having seen a new light.

“I see what you mean, Doctor,” said he. “You mean that if he got the
stuff from some Chinaman or common dope merchant, there wouldn’t be
much in it; whereas, if he got it from some one who had a general
stock of drugs, there might be a good deal in it. Is that the point?”

“Yes. He was able to obtain poisons from somebody, and we ought to
know exactly what facilities he had for obtaining poisons and what
poisons he obtained.”

“Yes, that is so,” said Miller. “Well, I will see about it at once.
Fortunately he is a pretty easy chappie to frighten. I expect, if I
give him a bit of a shake-up, he will give himself away; and if he
won’t, we must try other means. And now, as I think we have said all
that we have to say at present, I will wish you two gentlemen good
night.”

He rose and took up his hat, and having shaken our hands, was duly
escorted to the door by Thorndyke; who, when he had seen his visitor
safely on to the stairs, returned and confronted me with a look of
deep significance.

“You never told me about that cocaine,” said he.

“No,” I admitted. “It was stupid of me, but the fact is that I was so
engrossed by your rather startling observations on the case that this
detail slipped my memory.

“And it really had not impressed me as being of any importance. I
accepted Wallingford’s statement that the stuff was cocaine and that,
consequently, it was no concern of ours.”

“I don’t find myself able to agree to that ‘consequently,’ Mayfield.
How did you know that the cocaine was no concern of ours?”

“Well, I didn’t see that it was, and I don’t now. Do you?”

“No; I know very little about the case at present. But it seems to me
that the fact that a person in this house had a considerable quantity
of a highly poisonous substance in his possession is one that at least
requires to be noted. The point is, Mayfield, that until we know all
the facts of this case we cannot tell which of them is or is not
relevant. Try to bear that in mind. Do not select particular facts as
important and worthy of notice. Note everything in any way connected
with our problem that comes under your observation and pass it on to
me without sifting or selection.”

“I ought not to need these exhortations,” said I. “However, I will
bear them in mind should I ever have anything more to communicate.
Probably I never shall. But I will say that I think Miller is wasting
his energies over Wallingford. The man is no favourite of mine. He is
a neurotic ass. But I certainly do not think he has the makings of a
murderer.”

Thorndyke smiled a little drily. “If you are able,” said he, “to
diagnose at sight a potential murderer, your powers are a good deal
beyond mine. I should have said that every man has the makings of a
murderer, given the appropriate conditions.”

“Should you really?” I exclaimed. “Can you, for instance, imagine
either of us committing a murder?”

“I think I can,” he replied. “Of course, the probabilities are very
unequal in different cases. There are some men who may be said to be
prone to murder. A man of low intelligence, of violent temper,
deficient in ordinary self-control, may commit a murder in
circumstances that would leave a man of a superior type unmoved. But
still, the determining factors are motive and opportunity. Given a
sufficient motive and a real opportunity, I can think of no kind of
man who might not commit a homicide which would, in a legal sense, be
murder.”

“But is there such a thing as a sufficient motive for murder?”

“That question can be answered only by the individual affected. If it
seems to him sufficient, it is sufficient in practice.”

“Can you mention a motive that would seem to you sufficient?”

“Yes, I can. Blackmail. Let us take an imaginary case. Suppose a man
to be convicted of a crime of which he is innocent. As he has been
convicted, the evidence, though fallacious, is overwhelming. He is
sentenced to a term of imprisonment—say penal servitude. He serves his
sentence and is in due course discharged. He is now free; but the
conviction stands against him. He is a discharged convict. His name is
in the prison books, his photograph and his finger-prints are in the
Habitual Criminals’ Register. He is a marked man for life.

“Now suppose that he manages to shed his identity and in some place
where he is unknown begins life afresh. He acquires the excellent
character and reputation to which he is, in fact, entitled. He marries
and has a family; and he and his family prosper and enjoy the
advantages that follow deservedly from his industry and excellent
moral qualities.

“And now suppose that at this point his identity is discovered by a
blackmailer who forthwith fastens on him, who determines to live on
him in perpetuity, to devour the products of his industry, to
impoverish his wife and children and to destroy his peace and security
by holding over his head the constant menace of exposure. What is such
a man to do? The law will help him so far as it can; but it cannot
save him from exposure. He can obtain the protection of the law only
on condition that he discloses the facts. But that disclosure is
precisely the evil that he seeks to avoid. He is an innocent man, but
his innocence is known only to himself. The fact, which must transpire
if he prosecutes, is that he is a convicted criminal.

“I say, Mayfield, what can he do? What is his remedy? He has but one;
and since the law cannot really help him, he is entitled to help
himself. If I were in that man’s position and the opportunity
presented itself, I would put away that blackmailer with no more
qualms than I should have in killing a wasp.”

“Then I am not going to blackmail you, Thorndyke, for I have a strong
conviction that an opportunity would present itself.”

“I think it very probable,” he replied with a smile. “At any rate, I
know a good many methods that I should not adopt, and I think arsenic
poisoning is one of them. But don’t you agree with me?”

“I suppose I do, at least in the very extreme case that you have put.
But it is the only case of justifiable premeditated homicide that I
can imagine; and it obviously doesn’t apply to Wallingford.”

“My dear Mayfield,” he exclaimed. “How do we know what does or does
not apply to Wallingford? How do we know what he would regard as an
adequate motive? We know virtually nothing about him or his affairs or
about the crime itself. What we do know is that a man has apparently
been murdered, and that, of the various persons who had the
opportunity to commit the murder (of whom he is one) none had any
intelligible motive at all. It is futile for us to argue back and
forth on the insufficient knowledge that we possess. We can only
docket and classify all the facts that we have and follow up each of
them impartially with a perfectly open mind. But, above all, we must
try to increase our stock of facts. I suppose you haven’t had time to
consider that abstract of which we spoke?”

“That is really what brought me round here this evening. I haven’t had
time, and I shan’t have just at present as I am starting to-morrow to
take up work on the Southeastern Circuit. But I have brought the
current volume of the diary, itself, if you would care to wade through
it.”

“I should, certainly. The complete document is much preferable to an
abstract which might leave me in the dark as to the context. But won’t
you want to have your diary with you?”

“No, I shall take a short-hand note-book to use while I am away. That
is, in fact, what I usually do.”

“And you don’t mind putting this very confidential document into the
hands of a stranger?”

“You are not a stranger, Thorndyke. I don’t mind you, though I don’t
think I would hand it to anybody else. Not that it contains anything
that the whole world might not see, for I am a fairly discreet
diarist. But there are references to third parties with reflections
and comments that I shouldn’t care to have read by Thomas, Richard and
Henry. My only fear is that you will find it rather garrulous and
diffuse.”

“Better that than overcondensed and sketchy,” said he, as he took the
volume from me. He turned the leaves over, and having glanced at one
or two pages exclaimed: “This is something like a diary, Mayfield!
Quite in the classical manner. The common, daily jottings such as most
of us make, are invaluable if they are kept up regularly, but this of
yours is immeasurably superior. In a hundred years’ time it will be a
priceless historical work. How many volumes of it have you got?”

“About twenty: and I must say that I find the older ones quite
interesting reading. You may perhaps like to look at one or two of the
more recent volumes.”

“I should like to see those recording the events of the last three
years.”

“Well, they are all at your service. I have brought you my duplicate
latchkey and you will find the volumes of the diary in the glazed
book-case. It is usually kept locked, but as nobody but you will have
access to the chambers while I am away, I shall leave the key in the
lock.”

“This is really very good of you, Mayfield,” he said, as I rose to
take my departure. “Let me have your address, wherever you may be for
the time being, and I will keep you posted in any developments that
may occur. And now, good-bye and good luck!” He shook my hand
cordially and I betook myself to my chambers to complete my
preparations for my start on the morrow.



Chapter X

A Greek Gift

The incidents of my life while I was following the Southeastern
Circuit are no part of this history, and I refer to this period merely
by way of marking the passage of time. Indeed, it was its
separateness, its detachment from the other and more personal aspects
of my life that specially commended it to me. In the cheerful
surroundings of the Bar Mess I could forget the terrible experiences
of the last few weeks, and even in the grimmer and more suggestive
atmosphere of the courts, the close attention that the proceedings
demanded kept my mind in a state of wholesome preoccupation.

Quite a considerable amount of work came my way, and though most of
the briefs were small—so small, often, that I felt some compunction in
taking them from the more needy juniors—yet it was all experience and
what was more important just now, it was occupation that kept my mind
employed.

That was the great thing. To keep my mind busy with matters that were
not my personal concern. And the intensity of my yearning for
distraction was the measure of the extent to which my waking thoughts
tended to be pervaded by the sinister surroundings of Harold
Monkhouse’s death. That dreadful event and the mystery that
encompassed it had shaken me more than I had at first realized. Nor
need this be a matter for surprise. Harold Monkhouse had apparently
been murdered; at any rate that was the accepted view. And who was the
murderer? Evade the answer as I would, the fact remained that the
finger of suspicion pointed at my own intimate friends—nay, even at
me. It is no wonder, then, that the mystery haunted me. Murder has an
ominous sound to any ears; but to a lawyer practising in criminal
courts the word has connotations to which his daily experiences impart
a peculiarly hideous vividness and realism. Once, I remember that,
sitting in court, listening to the evidence in a trial for murder, as
my glance strayed to the dock where the prisoner stood, watched and
guarded like a captured wild beast, the thought suddenly flashed on me
that it was actually possible—and to the police actually probable—that
thus might yet stand Wallingford or Madeline, or even Barbara or
myself.

It would have been possible for me to run home from time to time at
week-ends but I did not. There was nothing that called for my presence
in London and it was better to stick close to my work. Still, I was
not quite cut off from my friends, for Barbara wrote regularly and I
had an occasional letter from Madeline. As to Thorndyke, he was too
busy to write unnecessary letters and his peculiar circumstances made
a secretary impossible, so that I had from him no more than one or two
brief notes reporting the absence of any new developments. Nor had
Barbara much to tell excepting that she had decided to let or sell the
house in Hilborough Square and take up her residence in a flat. The
decision did not surprise me. I should certainly have done the same in
her place; and I was only faintly surprised when I learned that she
proposed to live alone and that Madeline had taken a small flat near
the school. The two women had always been on excellent terms, but they
were not specially devoted to one another; and Barbara would now
probably pursue her own special interests. Of Wallingford I learned
only that, on the strength of his legacy he had taken a set of rooms
in the neighbourhood of Jermyn Street and that his nerves did not seem
to have benefited by the change.

Such was the position of affairs when the Autumn Assizes came to an
end and I returned home. I remember the occasion very vividly, as I
have good reason to do—indeed, I had better reason than I knew at the
time. It was a cold, dark, foggy evening, though not densely foggy,
and my taxicab was compelled to crawl at an almost funereal pace (to
the exasperation of the driver) through the murky streets, though the
traffic was now beginning to thin out. We approached the Temple from
the east and eventually entered by the Tudor Street Gate whence we
crept tentatively across King’s Bench Walk to the end of Crown Office
Row. As we passed Thorndyke’s chambers I looked up and had a momentary
glimpse of lighted windows glimmering through the fog; then they faded
away and I looked out on the other side where the great shadowy mass
of Paper Buildings loomed above us. A man was standing at the end of
the narrow passage that leads to Fig Tree Court—a tallish man wearing
a preposterous wide-brimmed hat and a long overcoat with its collar
turned up above his ears. I glanced at him incuriously as we
approached but had no opportunity to inspect him more closely, if I
had wished—which I did not—for, as the cab stopped he turned abruptly
and walked away up the passage. The suddenness of his retirement
struck me as a little odd and, having alighted from the cab, I stood
for a moment or two watching his receding figure. But he soon
disappeared in the foggy darkness, and I saw him no more. By the time
that I had paid my fare and carried my portmanteau to Fig Tree Court,
he had probably passed out into Middle Temple Lane.

When I had let myself into my chambers, switched on the light and shut
the door, I looked round my little domain with somewhat mixed
feelings. It was very silent and solitary. After the jovial Bar Mess
and the bright, frequented rooms of the hotels or the excellent
lodgings which I had just left, these chambers struck me as just a
shade desolate. But yet there were compensations. A sense of peace and
quiet pervaded the place and all around were my household gods; my
familiar and beloved pictures, the little friendly cabinet busts and
statuettes, and, above all, the goodly fellowship of books. And at
this moment my glance fell on the long range of my diaries and I
noticed that one of the series was absent. Not that there was anything
remarkable in that, since I had given Thorndyke express permission to
take them away to read. What did surprise me a little was the date of
the missing volume. It was that of the year before Stella’s death. As
I noted this I was conscious of a faint sense of annoyance. I had, it
is true, given him the free use of the diary, but only for purposes of
reference. I had hardly bargained for his perusal of the whole series
for his entertainment. However, it was of no consequence. The diary
enshrined no secrets. If I had, in a way, emulated Pepys in respect of
fulness, I had taken warning from his indiscretions; nor, in fact, was
I quite so rich in the material of indiscreet records as the vivacious
Samuel.

I unpacked my portmanteau—the heavier impedimenta were coming on by
rail—lit the gas fire in my bedroom, boiled a kettle of water, partly
for a comfortable wash and partly to fill a hotwater bottle wherewith
to warm the probably damp bed, and then, still feeling a little like a
cat in a strange house, decided to walk along to Thorndyke’s chambers
and hear the news, if there were any.

The fog had grown appreciably denser when I turned out of my entry,
and, crossing the little quadrangle, strode quickly along the narrow
passage that leads to the Terrace and King’s Bench Walk. I was
approaching the end of the passage when there came suddenly into view
a shadowy figure which I recognized at once as that of the man whom I
had seen when I arrived. But again I had no opportunity for a close
inspection, for he had already heard my footsteps and he now started
to walk away rapidly in the direction of Mitre Court. For a moment I
was disposed to follow him, and did, in fact, make a few quick steps
towards him—which seemed to cause him to mend his pace; but it was not
directly my business to deal with loiterers, and I could have done
nothing even if I had overtaken him. Accordingly I changed my
direction, and crossing King’s Bench Walk, bore down on Thorndyke’s
entry.

As I approached the house I was a little disconcerted to observe that
there were now no lights in his chambers, though the windows above
were lighted. I ran up the stairs, and finding the oak closed, pressed
the electric bell, which I could hear ringing on the floor above.
Almost immediately footsteps became audible descending the stairs and
were followed by the appearance of a small gentleman whom I recognized
as Thorndyke’s assistant, artificer or familiar spirit, Mr. Polton. He
recognized me at the same moment and greeted me with a smile that
seemed to break out of the corners of his eyes and spread in a network
of wrinkles over every part of his face; a sort of compound smile
inasmuch as every wrinkle seemed to have a smile of its own.

“I hope, Mr. Polton,” said I, “that I haven’t missed the doctor.”

“No, Sir,” he replied. “He is up in the laboratory. We are just about
to make a little experiment.”

“Well, I am in no hurry. Don’t disturb him. I will wait until he is at
liberty.”

“Unless, Sir,” he suggested, “you would like to come up. Perhaps you
would like to see the experiment.”

I closed with the offer gladly. I had never seen Thorndyke’s
laboratory and had often been somewhat mystified as to what he did in
it. Accordingly I followed Mr. Polton up the stairs, at the top of
which I found Thorndyke waiting.

“I thought it was your voice, Mayfield,” said he, shaking my hand.
“You are just in time to see us locate a mare’s nest. Come in and lend
a hand.”

He led me into a large room around which I glanced curiously and not
without surprise. One side was occupied by a huge copying camera, the
other by a joiner’s bench. A powerful back-geared lathe stood against
one window, a jeweller’s bench against the other, and the walls were
covered with shelves and tool-racks, filled with all sorts of strange
implements. From this room we passed into another which I recognized
as a chemical laboratory, although most of the apparatus in it was
totally unfamiliar to me.

“I had no idea,” said I, “that the practice of Medical Jurisprudence
involved such an outfit as this. What do you do with it all? The place
is like a factory.”

“It is a factory,” he replied with a smile; “a place where the raw
material of scientific evidence is worked up into the finished product
suitable for use in courts of law.”

“I don’t know that that conveys much to me,” said I. “But you are
going to perform some sort of experiment; perhaps that will enlighten
me.”

“Probably it will, to some extent,” he replied, “though it is only a
simple affair. We have a parcel here which came by post this evening
and we are going to see what is in it before we open it.”

“The devil you are!” I exclaimed. “How in the name of Fortune are you
going to do that?”

“We shall examine it by means of the X-rays.”

“But why? Why not open it and find out what is in it in a reasonable
way?”

Thorndyke chuckled softly. “We have had our little experiences,
Mayfield, and we have grown wary. We don’t open strange parcels
nowadays until we are sure that we are not dealing with a ‘Greek gift’
of some sort. That is what we are going to ascertain now in respect of
this.”

He picked up from the bench a parcel about the size of an ordinary
cigar-box and held it out for my inspection. “The overwhelming
probabilities are,” he continued, “that this is a perfectly innocent
package. But we don’t know. I am not expecting any such parcel and
there are certain peculiarities about this one that attract one’s
attention. You notice that the entire address is in rough Roman
capitals—what are commonly called ‘block letters.’ That is probably
for the sake of distinctness; but it might possibly be done to avoid a
recognizable handwriting or a possibly traceable typewriter. Then you
notice that it is addressed to ‘Dr. Thorndyke’ and conspicuously
endorsed ‘personal.’ Now, that is really a little odd. One understands
the object of marking a letter ‘personal’—to guard against its being
opened and read by the wrong person. But what does it matter who opens
a parcel?”

“I can’t imagine why it should matter,” I admitted without much
conviction, “but I don’t see anything in the unnecessary addition that
need excite suspicion. Do you?”

“Perhaps not; but you observe that the sender was apparently anxious
that the parcel should be opened by a particular person.”

I shrugged my shoulders. The whole proceeding and the reasons given
for it struck me as verging on farce. “Do you go through these
formalities with every parcel that you receive?” I asked.

“No,” he replied. “Only with those that are unexpected or offer no
evidence as to their origin. But we are pretty careful. As I said just
now, we have had our experiences. One of them was a box which, on
being opened, discharged volumes of poisonous gas.”

“The deuce!” I exclaimed, rather startled out of my scepticism and
viewing the parcel with a new-born respect, not unmixed with
apprehension. “Then this thing may actually be an infernal machine!
Confound it all, Thorndyke! Supposing it should have a clockwork
detonator, ticking away while we are talking. Hadn’t you better get on
with the X-rays?”

He chuckled at my sudden change of attitude. “It is all right,
Mayfield. There is no clockwork. I tried it with the microphone as
soon as it arrived. We always do that. And, of course, it is a
thousand to one that it is just an innocent parcel. But we will just
make sure and then I shall be at liberty for a chat with you.”

He led the way to a staircase leading to the floor above where I was
introduced to a large, bare room surrounded by long benches or tables
occupied by various uncanny-looking apparatus. As soon as we entered,
he placed the parcel on a raised stand while Polton turned a switch
connected with a great coil; the immediate result of which was a
peculiar, high-pitched, humming sound as if a gigantic mosquito had
got into the room. At the same moment a glass globe that was supported
on an arm behind the parcel became filled with green light and
displayed a bright red spot in its interior.

“This is a necromantic sort of business, Thorndyke,” said I, “only you
and Mr. Polton aren’t dressed for the part. You ought to have tall,
pointed caps and gowns covered with cabalistic signs. What is that
queer humming noise?”

“That is the interrupter,” he replied. “The green bulb is the
Crookes’s tube and the little red-hot disc inside it is the
anti-cathode. I will tell you about them presently. That framed plate
that Polton has is the fluorescent screen. It intercepts the X-rays
and makes them visible. You shall see, when Polton has finished his
inspection.”

I watched Polton—who had taken the opportunity to get the first
innings—holding the screen between his face and the parcel. After a
few moments’ inspection he turned the parcel over on its side and once
more raised the screen, gazing at it with an expression of the most
intense interest. Suddenly he turned to Thorndyke with a smile of
perfectly incredible wrinkliness and, without a word, handed him the
screen; which he held up for a few seconds and then silently passed to
me.

I had never used a fluorescent screen before and I must confess that I
found the experience most uncanny. As I raised it before the parcel
behind which was the glowing green bulb, the parcel became invisible
but in its place appeared the shadow of a pistol the muzzle of which
seemed to be inserted into a jar. There were some other, smaller
shadows, of which I could make nothing, but which seemed to be
floating in the air.

“Better not look too long, Mayfield,” said Thorndyke. “X-rays are
unwholesome things. We will take a photograph and then we can study
the details at our leisure; though it is all pretty obvious.”

“It isn’t to me,” said I. “There is a pistol and what looks like a
jar. Do you take it that they are parts of an infernal machine?”

“I suppose,” he replied, “we must dignify it with that name. What do
you say, Polton?”

“I should call it a booby-trap, Sir,” was the reply. “What you might
expect from a mischievous boy of ten—rather backward for his age.”

Thorndyke laughed. “Listen to the artificer,” said he, “and observe
how his mechanical soul is offended by an inefficient and unmechanical
attempt to blow us all up. But we won’t take the inefficiency too much
for granted. Let us have a photograph and then we can get to work with
safety.”

It seemed that this part also of the procedure was already provided
for in the form of a large black envelope which Polton produced from a
drawer and began forthwith to adjust in contact with the parcel; in
fact the appearance of preparedness was so striking that I remarked:

“This looks like part of a regular routine. It must take up a lot of
your time.”

“As a matter of fact,” he replied, “we don’t often have to do this. I
don’t receive many parcels and of those that are delivered, the
immense majority come from known sources and are accompanied by
letters of advice. It is only the strange and questionable packages
that we examine with the X-rays. Of course, this one was suspect at a
glance with that disguised handwriting and the special direction as to
who should open it.”

“Yes, I see that now. But it must be rather uncomfortable to live in
constant expectation of having bombs or poison-gas handed in by the
postman.”

“It isn’t as bad as that,” said he. “The thing has happened only three
or four times in the whole of my experience. The first gift of the
kind was a poisoned cigar, which I fortunately detected and which
served as a very useful warning. Since then I have kept my weather
eyelid lifting, as the mariners express it.”

“But don’t you find it rather wearing to be constantly on the look-out
for some murderous attack?”

“Not at all,” he answered with a laugh. “It rather adds to the zest of
life. Besides, you see, Mayfield, that on the rare occasions when
these trifles come my way, they are so extremely helpful.”

“Helpful!” I repeated. “In the Lord’s name, how?”

“In a number of ways. Consider my position, Mayfield. I am not like an
Italian or Russian politician who may have scores of murderous
enemies. I am a lawyer and an investigator of crime. Whoever wants to
get rid of me has something to fear from me; but at any given time,
there will not be more than one or two of such persons. Consequently,
when I receive a gift such as the present one, it conveys to me
certain items of information. Thus it informs me that some one is
becoming alarmed by some proceedings on my part. That is a very
valuable piece of information, for it tells me that some one of my
inquiries is at least proceeding along the right lines. It is
virtually an admission that I have made, or am in the way of making a
point. A little consideration of the cases that I have in hand will
probably suggest the identity of the sender. But on this question the
thing itself will, in most cases yield quite useful information as
well as telling us a good deal about the personality of the sender.
Take the present case. You heard Polton’s contemptuous observations on
the crudity of the device. Evidently the person who sent this is not
an engineer or mechanician of any kind. There is an obvious ignorance
of mechanism; and yet there is a certain simple ingenuity. The thing
is, in fact, as Polton said, on the level of a schoolboy’s booby-trap.
You must see that if we had in view two or more possible senders,
these facts might enable us to exclude one and select another. But
here is Polton with the photograph. Now we can consider the mechanism
at our leisure.”

As he spoke, Polton deposited on the bench a large porcelain dish or
tray in which was a very odd-looking photograph; for the whole of it
was jet-black excepting the pistol, the jar, the hinges, and a small,
elongated spot, which all stood out in clear, white silhouette.

“Why,” I exclaimed as I stooped over it, “that is a muzzle-loading
pistol!”

“Yes,” Thorndyke agreed, “and a pocket pistol, as you can tell by the
absence of a trigger-guard. The trigger is probably hinged and folds
forward into a recess. I daresay you know the kind of thing. They were
usually rather pretty little weapons—and useful, too, for you could
carry one easily in your waistcoat pocket. They had octagon barrels,
which screwed off for loading, and the butts were often quite
handsomely ornamented with silver mounts. They were usually sent out
by the gunsmiths in little baize-lined mahogany cases with
compartments for a little powder-flask and a supply of bullets.”

“I wonder why he used a muzzle-loader?” said I.

“Probably because he had it. It answers the purpose as well as a
modern weapon, and, as it was probably made more than a hundred years
ago, it would be useless to go round the trade enquiring as to recent
purchases.”

“Yes, it was safer to use an old pistol than to buy a new one and
leave possible tracks. But how does the thing work? I can see that the
hammer is at full cock and that there is a cap on the nipple. But what
fires the pistol?”

“Apparently a piece of string, which hasn’t come out in the photograph
except, faintly, just above that small mark—string is not dense enough
to throw a shadow at the full exposure—but you see, about an inch
behind the trigger, an elongated shadow. That is probably a screw-eye
seen end-ways. The string is tied to the trigger, passed through the
screw-eye and fastened to the lid of the box. I don’t see how. There
is no metal fastening, and you see that the lid is not screwed or
nailed down. As to how it works; you open the lid firmly; that pulls
the string tight; that pulls back the trigger and fires the pistol
into the jar, which is presumably full of some explosive; the jar
explodes and—up goes the donkey. There is a noble simplicity about the
whole thing. How do you propose to open it, Polton?”

“I think, Sir,” replied the latter, “we had better get the paper off
and have a look at the box.”

“Very well,” said Thorndyke, “but don’t take anything for granted.
Make sure that the paper isn’t part of the joke.”

I watched Polton with intense—and far from impersonal—interest,
wishing only that I could have observed him from a somewhat greater
distance. But for all his contempt for the “booby-trap,” he took no
unnecessary risks. First, with a pair of scissors, he cut out a piece
at the back and enlarged the opening so that he could peer in and
inspect the top of the lid. When he had made sure that there were no
pitfalls, he ran the scissors round the top and exposed the box, which
he carefully lifted out of the remainder of the wrapping and laid down
tenderly on the bench. It was a cigar-box of the flat type and
presented nothing remarkable excepting that the lid, instead of being
nailed or pinned down, was secured by a number of strips of stout
adhesive paper, and bore, near the middle, a large spot of
sealing-wax.

“That paper binding is quite a happy thought,” remarked Thorndyke,
“though it was probably put on because our friend was afraid to knock
in nails. But it would be quite effective. An impatient man would cut
through the front strips and then wrench the lid open. I think that
blob of sealing-wax answers our question about the fastening of the
string. The end of it was probably drawn through a bradawl hole in the
lid and fixed with sealing wax. But it must have been an anxious
business drawing it just tight enough and not too tight. I suggest,
Polton, that an inch and-a-half centre-bit hole just below and to the
right of the sealing-wax would enable us to cut the string. But you
had better try it with the photograph first.”

Polton picked the wet photograph out of the dish and carefully laid it
on the lid of the box, adjusting it so that the shadows of the hinges
were opposite the actual hinges. Then with a marking-awl he pricked
through the shadow of the screw-eye, and again about two inches to the
right and below it.

“You are quite right, Sir,” said he as he removed the photograph and
inspected the lid of the box. “The middle of the wax is exactly over
the screw-eye. I’ll just get the centre-bit.”

He bustled away down the stairs and returned in less than a minute
with a brace and a large centre-bit, the point of which he inserted
into the second awl-hole. Then, as Thorndyke grasped the box (and I
stepped back a pace or two), he turned the brace lightly and steadily,
stopping now and again to clear away the chips and examine the
deepening hole. A dozen turns carried the bit through the thin lid and
the remaining disc of wood was driven into the interior of the box. As
soon as the hole was clear, he cautiously inserted a dentist’s mirror,
which he had brought up in his pocket, and with its aid examined the
inside of the lid.

“I can see the string, Sir,” he reported; “a bit of common white twine
and it looks quite slack. I could reach it easily with a small pair of
scissors.”

He handed the mirror to Thorndyke, who, having confirmed his
observations, produced a pair of surgical scissors from his pocket.
These Polton cautiously inserted into the opening, and as he closed
them there was an audible snip. Then he slowly withdrew them and again
inserted the mirror.

“It’s all right,” said he. “The string is cut clean through. I think
we can open the lid now.” With a sharp penknife he cut through the
paper binding-strips and then, grasping the front of the lid,
continued: “Now for it. Perhaps you two gentlemen had better stand a
bit farther back, in case of accidents.”

I thought the suggestion an excellent one, but as Thorndyke made no
move, I had not the moral courage to adopt it. Nevertheless, I watched
Polton’s proceedings with my heart in my mouth. Very slowly and gently
did that cunning artificer raise the lid until it had opened some two
inches, when he stooped and peered in. Then, with the cheerful
announcement that it was “all clear,” he boldly turned it right back.

Of course, the photograph had shown us, in general, what to expect,
but there were certain details that had not been represented. For
instance, both the pistol and the jar were securely wedged between
pieces of cork—sections of wine-bottle corks, apparently—glued to the
bottom of the box.

“How is it,” I asked, “that those corks did not appear in the
photograph?”

“I think there is a faint indication of them,” Thorndyke replied; “but
Polton gave a rather full exposure. If you want to show bodies of such
low density as corks, you have to give a specially short exposure and
cut short the development, too. But I expect Polton saw them when he
was developing the picture, didn’t you, Polton?”

“Yes,” the latter replied; “they were quite distinct at one time, but
then I developed up to get the pistol out clear.”

While these explanations were being given, Polton proceeded
methodically to “draw the teeth” of the infernal apparatus. First, he
cut a little wedge of cork which he pushed in between the threatening
hammer and the nipple and having thus fixed the former he quietly
removed the percussion-cap from the latter; on which I drew a deep
breath of relief. He next wrenched away one of the corks and was then
able to withdraw the pistol from the jar and lift it out of the box. I
took it from him and examined it curiously, not a little interested to
note how completely it corresponded with Thorndyke’s description. It
had a blued octagon barrel, a folding trigger which fitted snugly into
a recess, a richly-engraved lock-plate and an ebony butt, decorated
with numbers of tiny silver studs and a little lozenge-shaped
scutcheon-plate on which a monogram had been engraved in minute
letters, which, however, had been so thoroughly scraped out that I was
unable to make out or even to guess what the letters had been.

My investigations were cut short by Thorndyke, who, having slipped on
a pair of rubber gloves now took the pistol from me, remarking: “You
haven’t touched the barrel, I think, Mayfield?”

“No,” I answered; “but why do you ask?”

“Because we shall go over it and the jar for finger-prints. Not that
they will be much use for tracing the sender of this present, but they
will be valuable corroboration if we catch him by other means; for
whoever sent this certainly had a guilty conscience.”

With this he delicately lifted out the jar—a small, dark-brown
stoneware vessel such as is used as a container for the choicer kinds
of condiments—and inverted it over a sheet of paper, upon which its
contents, some two or three tablespoonfuls of black powder, descended
and formed a small heap.

“Not a very formidable charge,” Thorndyke remarked, looking at it with
a smile.

“Formidable!” repeated Polton. “Why, it wouldn’t have hurt a fly!
Common black powder such as old women use to blow out the copper
flues. He must be an innocent, this fellow—if it is a he,” he added
reflectively.

Polton’s proviso suddenly recalled to my mind the man whom I had seen
lurking at the corner of Fig Tree Court. It was hardly possible to
avoid connecting him with the mysterious parcel, as Thorndyke agreed
when I had described the incident.

“Yes,” exclaimed Polton, “of course. He was waiting to hear the
explosion. It is a pity you didn’t mention it sooner, Sir. But he may
be waiting there still. Hadn’t I better run across and see?”

“And suppose he is there still,” said Thorndyke. “What would you
propose to do?”

“I should just pop up to the lodge and tell the porter to bring a
policeman down. Why we should have him red-handed.”

Thorndyke regarded his henchman with an indulgent smile. “Your
handicraft, Polton,” said he, “is better than your law. You can’t
arrest a man without a warrant unless he is doing something unlawful.
This man was simply standing at the corner of Fig Tree Court.”

“But,” protested Polton, “isn’t it unlawful to send infernal machines
by parcel post?”

“Undoubtedly it is,” Thorndyke admitted, “but we haven’t a particle of
evidence that this man has any connection with the parcel or with us.
He may have been waiting there to meet a friend.”

“He may, of course,” said I, “but seeing that he ran off like a
lamp-lighter on both the occasions when I appeared on the scene, I
should suspect that he was there for no good. And I strongly suspect
him of having some connection with this precious parcel.”

“So do I,” said Thorndyke. “As a matter of fact, I have once or twice,
lately, met a man answering to your description, loitering about
King’s Bench Walk in the evening. But I think it much better not to
appear to notice him. Let himself think himself unobserved and
presently he will do something definite that will enable us to take
action. And remember that the more thoroughly he commits himself the
more valuable his conduct will be as indirect evidence on certain
other matters.”

I was amused at the way in which Thorndyke sank all considerations of
personal safety in the single purpose of pursuing his investigations
to a successful issue. He was the typical enthusiast. The possibility
that this unknown person might shoot at him from some ambush, he
would, I suspected, have welcomed as offering the chance to seize the
aggressor and compel him to disclose his motives. Also, I had a shrewd
suspicion that he knew or guessed who the man was and was anxious to
avoid alarming him.

“Well,” he said when he had replaced the pistol and the empty jar in
the box and closed the latter, “I think we have finished for the
present. The further examination of these interesting trifles can be
postponed until to-morrow. Shall we go downstairs and talk over the
news?”

“It is getting rather late,” said I, “but there is time for a little
chat, though, as to news, they will have to come from you, for I have
nothing to tell.”

We went down to the sitting room where, when he had locked up the box,
we took each an armchair and filled our pipes.

“So you have no news of any kind?” said he.

“No; excepting that the Hilborough Square household has been broken up
and the inmates scattered into various flats.”

“Then the house is now empty?” said he, with an appearance of some
interest.

“Yes, and likely to remain so with this gruesome story attached to it.
I suppose I shall have to make a survey of the premises with a view to
having them put in repair.”

“When you do,” said he, “I should like to go with you and look over
the house.”

“But it is all dismantled. Everything has been cleared out. You will
find nothing there but empty rooms and a litter of discarded rubbish.”

“Never mind,” said he. “I have occasionally picked up some quite
useful information from empty rooms and discarded rubbish. Do you know
if the police have examined the house?”

“I believe not. At any rate, nothing has been said to me to that
effect.”

“So much the better,” said he. “Can we fix a time for our visit?”

“It can’t be to-morrow,” said I, “because I must see Barbara and get
the keys if she has them. Would the day after to-morrow do, after
lunch?”

“Perfectly,” he replied. “Come and lunch with me; and, by the way,
Mayfield, it would be best not to mention to any one that I am coming
with you, and I wouldn’t say anything about this parcel.”

I looked at him with sudden suspicion, recalling Wallingford’s
observations on the subject of mare’s nests. “But, my dear Thorndyke!”
I exclaimed, “you don’t surely associate that parcel with any of the
inmates of that house!”

“I don’t associate it with any particular person,” he replied. “I know
only what you know; that it was sent by some one to whom my existence
is, for some reason, undesirable, and whose personality is to some
extent indicated by the peculiarities of the thing itself.”

“What peculiarities do you mean?”

“Well,” he replied, “there is the nature and purpose of the thing. It
is an appliance for killing a human being. That purpose implies either
a very strong motive or a very light estimate of the value of human
life. Then, as we have said, the sender is fairly ingenious but yet
quite unmechanical and apparently unprovided with the common tools
which ordinary men possess and are more or less able to use. You
notice that the combination of ingenuity with non-possession of tools
is a rather unusual one.”

“How do you infer that the sender possessed no tools?”

“From the fact that none were used, and that such materials were
employed as required no tools, though these were not the most suitable
materials. For instance, common twine was used to pull the trigger,
though it is a bad material by reason of its tendency to stretch. But
it can be cut with a knife or a pair of scissors, whereas wire, which
was the really suitable material, requires cutting pliers to divide
it. Again, there were the corks. They were really not very safe, for
their weakness and their resiliency might have led to disaster in the
event of a specially heavy jerk in transit. A man who possessed no
more than a common keyhole saw, or a hand-saw and a chisel or two,
would have roughly shaped up one or two blocks of wood to fit the
pistol and jar, which would have made the thing perfectly secure. If
he had possessed a glue-pot, he would not have used seccotine. But
every one has waste corks, and they can be trimmed to shape with an
ordinary dinner-knife; and seccotine can be bought at any stationer’s.
But, to return to what we were saying. I had no special precautions in
my mind. I suggested that we should keep our own counsel merely on the
general principle that it is always best to keep one’s own counsel.
One may make a confidence to an entirely suitable person; but who can
say that that person may not, in his or her turn, make a confidence?
If we keep our knowledge strictly to ourselves we know exactly how we
stand, and that if there has been any leakage, it had been from some
other source. But I need not platitudinize to an experienced and
learned counsel.”

I grinned appreciatively at the neat finish; for “experienced counsel”
as I certainly was not, I was at least able to realize, with secret
approval, how adroitly Thorndyke had eluded my leading question. And
at that I left it, enquiring in my turn:

“I suppose nothing of interest has transpired since I have been away?”

“Very little. There is one item of news, but that can hardly be said
to have ‘transpired’ unless you can associate the process of
transpiration with a suction-pump. Superintendent Miller took my
advice and applied the suctorial method to Wallingford with results of
which he possibly exaggerates the importance. He tells me—this is, of
course, in the strictest confidence—that under pressure, Wallingford
made a clean breast of the cocaine and morphine business. He admitted
that he had obtained those drugs fraudulently by forging an order in
Dimsdale’s name, written on Dimsdale’s headed note-paper, to the
wholesale druggists to deliver to bearer the drugs mentioned. He had
possessed himself of the note-paper at the time when he was working at
the account books in Dimsdale’s surgery.”

“But how was it that Dimsdale did not notice what had happened when
the accounts were sent in?”

“No accounts were ever sent in. The druggists whom Wallingford
patronized were not those with whom Dimsdale had an account. The order
stated, in every case, that bearer would pay cash.”

“Quite an ingenious little plan of Wallingford’s,” I remarked. “It is
more than I should have given him credit for. And you say that Miller
attaches undue importance to this discovery. I am not surprised at
that. But why do you think he exaggerates its importance?”

Thorndyke regarded me with a quizzical smile. “Because,” he answered,
“Miller’s previous experiences have been repeated. There has been
another discovery. It has transpired that Miss Norris also had
dealings with a wholesale druggist. But in her case there was no fraud
or irregularity. The druggist with whom she dealt was the one who used
to supply her father with materia medica and to whom she was well
known.”

“Then, in that case, I suppose she had an account with him?”

“No, she did not. She also paid cash. Her purchases were only
occasional and on quite a small scale; too small to justify an
account.”

“Has she made any statement as to what she wanted the drugs for?”

“She denies that she ever purchased drugs, in the usual sense, that is
substances having medicinal properties. Her purchases were, according
to her statement, confined to such pharmaceutical and chemical
materials as were required for purposes of instruction in her classes.
Which is perfectly plausible, for, as you know, academic cookery is a
rather different thing from the cookery of the kitchen.”

“Yes, I know that she had some materials in her cupboard that I
shouldn’t have associated with cookery and I should accept her
statement without hesitation. In fact, the discovery seems to me to be
of no significance at all.”

“Probably you are right,” said he; “but the point is that, in a legal
sense, it confuses the issues hopelessly. In her case, as in
Wallingford’s, materials have been purchased from a druggist, and, as
no record of those purchases has been kept, it is impossible to say
what those materials were. Probably they were harmless, but it cannot
be proved that they were. The effect is that the evidential value of
Wallingford’s admission is discounted by the fact that there was
another person who is known to have purchased materials some of which
may have been poisons.”

“Yes,” said I, “that is obvious enough. But doesn’t it strike you,
Thorndyke, that all this is just a lot of futile logic-chopping such
as you might hear at a debating club? I can’t take it seriously. You
don’t imagine that either of these two persons murdered Harold
Monkhouse, do you? I certainly don’t; and I can’t believe Miller
does.”

“It doesn’t matter very much what he believes, or, for that matter,
what any of us believe. ‘He discovers who proves.’ Up to the present,
none of us has proved anything, and my impression is that Miller is
becoming a little discouraged. He is a genius in following up clues.
But where there are no clues to follow up, the best of detectives is
rather stranded.”

“By the way,” said I, “did you pick up anything from my diary that
threw any light on the mystery?”

“Very little,” he replied; “in fact nothing that gets us any farther.
I was able to confirm our belief that Monkhouse’s attacks of severe
illness coincided with his wife’s absence from home. But that doesn’t
help us much. It merely indicates, as we had already observed, that
the poisoner was so placed that his or her activities could not be
carried on when the wife was at home. But I must compliment you on
your diary, Mayfield. It is quite a fascinating work; so much so that
I have been tempted to encroach a little on your kindness. The
narrative of the last three years was so interesting that it lured me
on to the antecedents that led up to them. It reads like a novel.”

“How much of it have you read?” I asked, my faint resentment
completely extinguished by his appreciation.

“Six volumes,” he replied, “including the one that I have just
borrowed. I began by reading the last three years for the purposes of
our inquiry, and then I ventured to go back another three years for
the interest of tracing the more remote causation of recent events. I
hope I have not presumed too much on the liberty that you were kind
enough to give me.”

“Not at all,” I replied, heartily. “I am only surprised that a man as
much occupied as you are should have been willing to waste your time
on the reading of what is, after all, but a trivial and diffuse
autobiography.”

“I have not wasted my time, Mayfield,” said he. “If it is true that
‘the proper study of mankind is man,’ how much more true is it of that
variety of mankind that wears the wig and gown and pleads in Court. It
seems to me that to lawyers like ourselves whose professional lives
are largely occupied with the study of motives of human actions and
with the actions themselves viewed in the light of their antecedents
and their consequences, nothing can be more instructive than a full,
consecutive diary in which, over a period of years, events may be
watched growing out of those that went before and in their turn
developing their consequences and elucidating the motives of the
actors. Such a diary is a synopsis of human life.”

I laughed as I rose to depart. “It seems,” said I, “that I wrought
better than I knew; in fact I am disposed, like Pendennis, to regard
myself with respectful astonishment. But perhaps I had better not be
too puffed up. It may be that I am, after all, no more than a sort of
literary Strasburg goose; an unconscious provider of the food of the
gods.”

Thorndyke laughed in his turn and escorted me down the stairs to the
entry where we stood for a few moments looking out into the fog.

“It seems thicker than ever,” said he. “However, you can’t miss your
way. But keep a look-out as you go, in case our friend is still
waiting at the corner. Good night!”

I returned his farewell and plunged into the fog, steering for the
corner of the library, and was so fortunate as to strike the wall
within a few yards of it. From thence I felt my way without difficulty
to the Terrace where I halted for a moment to look about and listen;
and as there was no sign, visible or audible of any loiterer at the
corner, I groped my way into the passage and so home to my chambers
without meeting a single human creature.



Chapter XI

The Rivals

The warmth with which Barbara greeted me when I made my first
appearance at her flat struck me as rather pathetic, and for the first
time I seemed to understand what it was that had induced her to marry
Harold Monkhouse. She was not a solitary woman by nature and she had
never been used to a solitary existence. When Stella’s death had
broken up her home and left her with no intimate friend in the world
but me, I had been too much taken up with my own bereavement to give
much consideration to her. But now, as she stood before me in her
pretty sitting room, holding both my hands and smiling her welcome, it
was suddenly borne in on me that her state was rather forlorn in spite
of her really comfortable means. Indeed, my heart prompted me to some
demonstrations of affection and I was restrained only by the caution
of a confirmed bachelor. For Barbara was now a widow; and even while
my sympathy with my almost life-long friend tempted me to pet her a
little, some faint echoes of Mr. Tony Weller’s counsels bade me
beware.

“You are quite an anchoress here, Barbara,” I said, “though you have a
mighty comfortable cell. I see you have a new maid, too. I should have
thought you would have brought Mabel with you.”

“She wouldn’t come—naturally. She said she preferred to go and live
among strangers and forget what had happened at Hilborough Square.
Poor Mabel! She was very brave and good, but it was a terrible
experience for her.”

“Do you know what has become of her?”

“No. She has disappeared completely. Of course, she has never applied
for a reference.”

“Why ‘of course’?”

“My dear Rupert,” she replied a little bitterly, “do you suppose that
she would want to advertise her connection with Mrs. Harold
Monkhouse?”

“No, I suppose she would be likely to exaggerate the publicity of the
affair, as I think you do. And how is Madeline? I rather expected that
you and she would have shared a flat. Why didn’t you?”

Barbara was disposed to be evasive. “I don’t know,” she replied, “that
the plan commended itself to either of us. We have our separate
interests, you know. At any rate, she never made any such suggestion
and neither did I.”

“Do you ever see Wallingford now?” I asked.

“Indeed, I do,” she replied; “in fact I have had to hint to him that
he mustn’t call too frequently. One must consider appearances, and,
until I spoke, he was here nearly every day. But I hated doing it.”

“Still, Barbara, it was very necessary. It would be so in the case of
any young woman; but in your case—er—especially so.”

I broke off awkwardly, not liking to say exactly what was in my mind.
For, of course, in the atmosphere of suspicion which hung about him,
his frequent visits would be a source of real danger. No motive for
the murder had yet been suggested. It would be a disaster if his folly
were to create the false appearance of one. But, as I have said, I
shrank from pointing this out, though I think she understood what was
in my mind, for she discreetly ignored the abrupt finish of my
sentence and continued:

“Poor Tony! He is so very self-centred and he seems so dependent on
me. And really, Rupert, I am a good deal concerned about him.”

“Why?” I asked, rather unsympathetically.

“He is getting so queer. He was always rather odd, as you know, but
this trouble seems to be quite upsetting his balance. I am afraid he
is getting delusions—and yet, in a way, I hope that he is.”

“What do you mean? What sort of delusions?”

“He imagines that he is being followed and watched. It is a perfect
obsession, especially since that superintendent man called on him and
cross-questioned him. But I don’t think I told you about that.”

“No, you did not,” said I, quite truthfully, but with an uncomfortable
feeling that I was indirectly telling a lie.

“Well, it seems that this man, Miller, called at his rooms—so you see
he knew where Tony was living—and, according to Tony’s account,
extracted by all sorts of dreadful threats, a full confession of the
means by which he obtained that cocaine.”

“And how did he obtain it?”

“Oh, he just bought it at a wholesale druggist’s. Rather casual of the
druggist to have supplied him, I think, but still, he needn’t have
made such a secret of it. However, since then he has been possessed by
this obsession. He imagines that he is constantly under observation.
He thinks that some man hangs about near his rooms and watches his
comings and goings and follows him about whenever he goes abroad. I
suppose there can’t be anything in it?”

“Of course not. The police have something better to do than spend
their time shadowing harmless idiots. Why on earth should they shadow
him? If they have any suspicions of him, those suspicions relate to
the past, not to the present.”

“But I don’t think Tony connects these watchers with the police. I
fancy he suspects them of being agents of Dr. Thorndyke. You remember
that he was suspicious and uneasy about Dr. Thorndyke from the first;
and I know that he suspects him of having set the superintendent on
him about the cocaine.”

“The deuce he does!” I exclaimed, a little startled. “Have you any
idea what makes him suspect Thorndyke of that?”

“He says that the superintendent accepted his statement at the time
when the cocaine was found, or at least, did not seem disposed to
press him on the question as to where he obtained it, and that this
inquisition occurred only after you had put the case in Dr.
Thorndyke’s hands.”

I reflected on this statement with some surprise. Of course,
Wallingford was quite right, as I knew from first-hand knowledge. But
how had he arrived at this belief? Was it a mere guess, based on his
evident prejudice against Thorndyke? or had he something to go on? And
was it possible that his other suspicions might be correct? Could it
be that Thorndyke was really keeping him under observation? I could
imagine no object for such a proceeding. But Thorndyke’s methods were
so unlike those of the police or of any one else that it was idle to
speculate on what he might do; and his emphatic advice to Miller
showed that he regarded Wallingford at least with some interest.

“Well, Barbara,” I said, mentally postponing the problem for future
consideration, “let us forget Wallingford and everybody else. What are
we going to do this afternoon? Is there a matinée that we could go to,
or shall we go and hear some music?”

“No, Rupert,” she replied. “I don’t want any theatres or music. I can
have those when you are not here. Let us go and walk about Kensington
Gardens and gossip as we used to in the old days. But we have a little
business to discuss first. Let us get that finished and then we can
put it away and be free. You were going to advise me about the house
in Hilborough Square. My own feeling is that I should like to sell it
and have done with it once for all.”

“I shouldn’t do that, Barbara,” said I. “It is a valuable property,
but just at present its value is depreciated. It would be difficult to
dispose of at anything like a reasonable price until recent events
have been forgotten. The better plan would be to let it at a low rent
for a year or two.”

“But would anybody take it?”

“Undoubtedly, if the rent were low enough. Leave it to Brodribb and me
to manage. You needn’t come into the matter at all beyond signing the
lease. Is the house in fairly good repair?”

“Most of it is, but there are one or two rooms that will need
redecorating, particularly poor Harold’s. That had to be left when the
other rooms were done because he refused to be disturbed. It is in a
very dilapidated state. The paint is dreadfully shabby and the paper
is positively dropping off the walls in places. I daresay you remember
its condition.”

“I do, very well, seeing that I helped Madeline to paste some of the
loose pieces back in their places. But we needn’t go into details now.
I will go and look over the house and see what is absolutely necessary
to make the place presentable. Who has the keys?”

“I have the latch-keys. The other keys are inside the house.”

“And I suppose you don’t wish to inspect the place yourself?”

“No. I do not. I wish never to set eyes upon that house again.”

She unlocked a little bureau, and taking a bunch of latch-keys from
one of the drawers handed it to me. Then she went away to put on her
out-door clothes.

Left alone in the room, I sauntered round and inspected Barbara’s new
abode, noting how, already, it seemed to reflect in some indefinable
way the personality of the tenant. It is this sympathetic quality in
human dwelling-places which gives its special charm and interest to a
room in which some person of character has lived and worked, and
which, conversely, imparts such deadly dulness to the “best room” in
which no one is suffered to distribute the friendly, humanizing
litter, and which is jealously preserved, with all its lifeless
ornamentation—its unenjoyed pictures and its unread books—intact and
undefiled by any traces of human occupation. The furniture of this
room was mostly familiar to me, for it was that of the old boudoir.
There was the little piano, the two cosy armchairs, the open
book-shelves with their array of well-used books, the water-colours on
the walls, and above the chimney-piece, the little portrait of Stella
with the thin plait of golden hair bordering the frame.

I halted before it and gazed at the beloved face which seemed to look
out at me with such friendly recognition, and let my thoughts drift
back into the pleasant old times and stray into those that might have
been if death had mercifully passed by this sweet maid and left me the
one companion that my heart yearned for. Now that time had softened my
passionate grief into a tender regret, I could think of her with a
sort of quiet detachment that was not without its bitter-sweet
pleasure. I could let myself speculate on what my life might have been
if she had lived, and what part she would have played in it; questions
that, strangely enough, had never arisen while she was alive.

I was so immersed in my reverie that I did not hear Barbara come into
the room, and the first intimation that I had of her presence was when
I felt her hand slip quietly into mine. I turned to look at her and
met her eyes, brimming with tears, fixed on me with an expression of
such unutterable sadness that, in a moment, my heart leaped out to
her, borne on a wave of sympathy and pity which swept away all my
caution and reserve. Forgetful of everything but her loneliness and
the grief which we shared, I drew her to me and kissed her. It seemed
the natural thing to do and I felt that she understood, though she
flushed warmly and the tears started from her eyes so that she must
needs wipe them away. Then she looked at me with the faintest, most
pathetic little smile and without a word, we turned together and
walked out of the room.

Barbara was, as I have said, a rather inscrutable and extremely
self-contained woman, but she could be, on occasions, a very
delightful companion. And so I found her to-day. At first a little
pensive and silent, she presently warmed up into a quite unwonted
gaiety and chatted so pleasantly and made so evident her pleasure at
having me back that I yearned no more for the Bar Mess but was able to
forget the horrors and anxieties of the past and give myself up to the
very agreeable present.

I have seldom spent a more enjoyable afternoon. Late autumn as it was,
the day was mild and sunny, the sky of that wonderful tender, misty
blue that is the peculiar glory of London. And the gardens, too,
though they were beginning to take on their winter garb, had not yet
quite lost their autumnal charm. Still, on the noble elms, thin as
their raiment was growing, the golden and russet foliage lingered, and
the leaves that they had already shed remained to clothe the earth
with a many-coloured carpet.

We had crossed the gardens by some of the wider paths and had turned
into one of the pleasant by-paths when Barbara, spying a seat set back
between a couple of elms, suggested that we should rest for a few
minutes before recrossing the gardens to go forth in search of tea.
Accordingly we sat down, sheltered on either side by the great boles
of the elms and warmed by the rays of the late afternoon sun; but we
had been seated hardly a minute when the peace and forgetfulness that
had made our ramble so delightful were dissipated in a moment by an
apparition on the wide path that we had just left.

I was the first to observe it. Glancing back through the interval
between the elm on my left and another at a little distance, I noticed
a man coming toward us. My attention was first drawn to him by his
rather singular behaviour. He seemed to be dividing his attention
between something that was ahead of him and something behind. But I
had taken no special note of him until I saw him step, with a rather
absurd air of secrecy and caution, behind a tree-trunk and peer round
it along the way that he had come. After keeping a look-out in this
fashion for nearly a minute, apparently without result, he backed away
from the tree and came forward at a quick pace, peering eagerly ahead
and on both sides and pausing now and again to cast a quick look back
over his shoulder. I drew Barbara’s attention to him, remarking:

“There is a gentleman who seems to be afflicted with Wallingford’s
disease. He is trying to look all round the compass at once.”

Barbara looked at the man, watching his movements for a time with a
faint smile. But suddenly the smile faded and she exclaimed:

“Why, I believe it _is_ Tony! Yes, I am sure it is.”

And Tony it was. I recognized him almost as soon as she spoke. He came
on now at a quick pace and seemed in a hurry either to escape from
what he supposed to be behind him or to overtake whatever was in
front. He had apparently not seen us, for though we must have been
visible to him—or we could not have seen him—we were rendered
inconspicuous by the two trees between which we sat. Presently he
disappeared as the nearer elm-trunk hid him from our view, and I
waited with half-amused annoyance for him to reappear.

“What a nuisance he is!” said Barbara. “Disturbing our peaceful
tête-à-tête. But he won’t freeze on to us. He would rather forego my
much desired society than put up with yours.” She laughed softly and
added in a thoughtful tone: “I wonder what he is doing here.”

I had been wondering that, myself. Kensington Gardens were quite near
to Barbara’s flat, but they were a long way from Jermyn Street. It was
certainly odd that he should be here and on this day of all days. But
at this point my reflections were interrupted by the appearance of
their subject from behind the big elm-trunk.

He came on us suddenly and was quite close before he saw us. When he
did see us, however, he stopped short within a few paces of us,
regarding us with a wild stare. It was the first time that I had seen
him since the funeral; and certainly his appearance had not improved
in the interval. There was something neglected and dishevelled in his
aspect that was distinctly suggestive of drink or drugs. But what
principally struck me was the expression of furious hate with which he
glared at me. There was no mistaking it. Whatever might be the cause,
there could be no doubt that he regarded me with almost murderous
animosity. He remained in this posture only for a few seconds. Then,
as Barbara had begun to utter a few words of greeting, he raised his
hat and strode away without a word.

Barbara looked at his retreating figure with a vexed smile.

“Silly fellow!” she exclaimed. “He is angry that I have come out to
spend a few hours with my oldest friend, and shows it like a
bad-mannered child. I wish he would behave more like an ordinary
person.”

“You can hardly expect him to behave like what he is not,” I said.
“Besides, a very ordinary man may feel jealous at seeing another man
admitted to terms of intimacy, which are denied to him, with the woman
to whom he is specially attached. For I suppose, Barbara, we may take
it that that is the position?”

“I suppose so,” she admitted. “He is certainly very devoted to me, and
I am afraid he is rather jealous of you.”

As she spoke, I looked at her and could not but feel a faint sympathy
with Wallingford. She was really a very handsome woman; and to-day she
was not only looking her best; she seemed, in some mysterious way to
have grown younger, more girlish. The rather sombre gravity of the
last few years seemed to be quite dissipated since we had left the
flat, and much of the charm of her youth had come back to her.

“He looked more than rather jealous,” said I. “Venomous hatred was
what I read in his face. Do you think he has anything against me other
than my position as his rival in your affections?”

“Yes, I do. He is mortally afraid of you. He believes that you suspect
him of having, at least had a hand in poor Harold’s death and that you
have set Dr. Thorndyke to track him down and bring the crime home to
him. And his terror of Dr. Thorndyke is positively an insane
obsession.”

I was by no means so sure of this, but I said nothing, and she
continued:

“I suppose you don’t know whether Dr. Thorndyke does really look on
him with any suspicion? To me the idea is preposterous. Indeed, I find
it impossible to believe that there was any crime at all. I am
convinced that poor Harold was the victim of some strange accident.”

“I quite agree with you, Barbara. That is exactly my own view. But I
don’t think it is Thorndyke’s. As to whom he suspects—if he suspects
anybody—I have not the faintest idea. He is a most extraordinarily
close and secretive man. No one ever knows what is in his mind until
the very moment when he strikes. And he never does strike until he has
his case so complete that he can take it into court with the certainty
of getting a conviction, or an acquittal, as the case may be.”

“But I suppose there are mysteries that elude even his skill?”

“No doubt there are; and I am not sure that our mystery is not one of
them. Even Thorndyke can’t create evidence, and as he pointed out to
me, the evidence in our case lies in the past and is mostly
irrecoverable.”

“I hope it is not entirely irrecoverable,” said she; “for until some
reasonable solution of the mystery is reached, an atmosphere of
suspicion will continue to hang about all the inmates of that house.
So let us wish Dr. Thorndyke his usual success; and when he has proved
that no one was guilty—which I am convinced is the fact—perhaps poor
Tony will forgive him.”

With this, we dismissed the subject, and, getting up from the seat,
made our way out of the gardens just as the sun was setting behind the
trees, and went in search of a suitable tea-shop. And there we
lingered gossiping until the evening was well advanced and it was time
for me to see Barbara home to her flat and betake myself to Fig Tree
Court and make some pretence of doing an evening’s work.



Chapter XII

Thorndyke Challenges the Evidence

My relations with Thorndyke were rather peculiar and a little
inconsistent. I had commissioned him, somewhat against his
inclination, to investigate the circumstances connected with the death
of Harold Monkhouse. I was, in fact, his employer. And yet, in a
certain subtle sense, I was his antagonist. For I held certain beliefs
which I, half-unconsciously, looked to him to confirm. But apparently
he did not share those beliefs. As his employer, it was clearly my
duty to communicate to him any information which he might think
helpful or significant, even if I considered it irrelevant. He had, in
fact, explicitly pointed this out to me; and he had specially warned
me to refrain from sifting or selecting facts which might become known
to me according to my view of their possible bearing on the case.

But yet this was precisely what I felt myself constantly tempted to
do; and as we sat at lunch in his chambers on the day after my visit
to Barbara, I found myself consciously suppressing certain facts which
had then come to my knowledge. And it was not that those facts
appeared to me insignificant. On the contrary, I found them rather
surprising. Only I had the feeling that they would probably convey to
Thorndyke a significance that would be erroneous and misleading.

There was, for instance, the appearance of Wallingford in Kensington
Gardens. Could it have been sheer chance? If so, it was a most
remarkable coincidence; and one naturally tends to look askance at
remarkable coincidences. In fact, I did not believe it to be a
coincidence at all. I felt little doubt that Wallingford had been
lurking about the neighbourhood of Barbara’s flat and had followed us,
losing sight of us temporarily, when we turned into the by-path. But,
knowing Wallingford as I did, I attached no importance to the
incident. It was merely a freak of an unstable, emotional man impelled
by jealousy to make a fool of himself. Again, there was Wallingford’s
terror of Thorndyke and his ridiculous delusions on the subject of the
“shadowings.” How easy it would be for a person unacquainted with
Wallingford’s personality to read into them a totally misleading
significance! Those were the thoughts that drifted half-consciously
through my mind as I sat opposite my friend at the table. So, not
without some twinges of conscience, I held my peace.

But I had not allowed for Thorndyke’s uncanny capacity for inferring
what was passing in another person’s mind. Very soon it became evident
to me that he was fully alive to the possibility of some reservations
on my part; and when one or two discreet questions had elicited some
fact which I ought to have volunteered, he proceeded to something like
definite cross-examination.

“So the household has broken up and the inmates scattered?” he began,
when I had told him that I had obtained possession of the keys. “And
Mabel Withers seems to have vanished, unless the police have kept her
in view. Did you hear anything about Miss Norris?”

“Not very much. Barbara and she have exchanged visits once or twice,
but they don’t seem to see much of each other.”

“And what about Wallingford? Does he seem to have been much disturbed
by Miller’s descent on him?”

I had to admit that he was in a state bordering on panic.

“And what did Mrs. Monkhouse think of the forged orders on Dimsdale’s
headed paper?”

“He hadn’t disclosed that. She thinks that he bought the cocaine at a
druggist’s in the ordinary way, and I didn’t think it necessary to
undeceive her.”

“No. The least said the soonest mended. Did you gather that she sees
much of Wallingford?”

“Yes, rather too much. He was haunting her flat almost daily until she
gave him a hint not to make his visits too noticeable.”

“Why do you suppose he was haunting her flat? So far as you can judge,
Mayfield—that is in the strictest confidence, you understand—does
there seem to be anything between them beyond ordinary friendliness?”

“Not on her side, certainly, but on his—yes, undoubtedly. His devotion
to her amounts almost to infatuation, and has for a long time past. Of
course, she realizes his condition, and though he is rather a nuisance
to her, she takes a very kindly and indulgent view of his vagaries.”

“Naturally, as any well-disposed woman would. I suppose you didn’t see
anything of him yesterday?”

Of course I had to relate the meeting in Kensington Gardens, and I
could see by the way Thorndyke looked at me that he was wondering why
I had not mentioned the matter before.

“It almost looks,” said he, “as if he had followed you there. Was
there anything in his manner of approach that seemed to support that
idea?”

“I think there was, for I saw him at some distance,” and here I felt
bound to describe Wallingford’s peculiar tactics.

“But,” said Thorndyke, “why was he looking about behind him? He must
have known that you were in front.”

“It seems,” I explained, feebly, “that he has some ridiculous idea
that he is being watched and followed.”

“Ha!” said Thorndyke. “Now I wonder who he supposes is watching and
following him.”

“I fancy he suspects you,” I replied. And so the murder was out, with
the additional fact that I had not been very ready with my
information.

Thorndyke, however, made no comment on my reticence beyond a steady
and significant look at me.

“So,” said he, “he suspects me of suspecting him. Well, he is giving
us every chance. But I think, Mayfield, you would do well to put Mrs.
Monkhouse on her guard. If Wallingford makes a public parade of his
feelings towards her, he may put dangerous ideas into the head of Mr.
Superintendent Miller. You must realize that Miller is looking for a
motive for the assumed murder. And if it comes to his knowledge that
Harold Monkhouse’s secretary was in love with Harold Monkhouse’s wife,
he will think that he has found a motive that is good enough.”

“Yes, that had occurred to me; and in fact, I did give her a hint to
that effect, but it was hardly necessary. She had seen it for
herself.”

As we now seemed to have exhausted this topic, I ventured to make a
few enquiries about the rather farcical infernal machine.

“Did your further examination of it,” I asked, “yield any new
information?”

“Very little,” Thorndyke replied, “but that little was rather curious.
There were no finger-prints at all. I examined both the pistol and the
jar most thoroughly, but there was not a trace of a finger-mark, to
say nothing of a print. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that
the person who sent the machine wore gloves while he was putting it
together.”

“But isn’t that a rather natural precaution in these days?” I asked.

“A perfectly natural precaution, in itself,” he replied, “but not
quite consistent with some other features. For instance, the wadding
with which the pistol-barrel was plugged consisted of a little ball of
knitting-wool of a rather characteristic green. I will show it to you,
and you will see that it would be quite easy to match and therefore
possible to trace. But you see that there are thus shown two contrary
states of mind. The gloves suggest that the sender entertained the
possibility that the machine might fail to explode, whereas the wool
seems to indicate that no such possibility was considered.”

He rose from the table—lunch being now finished—and brought from a
locked cabinet a little ball of wool of a rather peculiar greenish
blue. I took it to the window and examined it carefully, impressed by
the curious inconsistency which he had pointed out.

“Yes,” I agreed, “there could be no difficulty in matching this. But
as to tracing it, that is a different matter. There must have been
thousands of skeins of this sold to, at least, hundreds of different
persons.”

“Very true,” said he. “But I was thinking of it rather as a
corroborating item in a train of circumstantial evidence.”

He put the “corroborating item” back in the cabinet and as, at this
moment a taxi was heard to draw up at our entry, he picked up a large
attaché case and preceded me down the stairs.

During the comparatively short journey I made a few not very
successful efforts to discover what was Thorndyke’s real purpose in
making this visit of inspection to the dismantled house. But his
reticence and mine were not quite similar. He answered all my
questions freely. He gave me a wealth of instances illustrating the
valuable evidence obtained by the inspection of empty houses. But none
of them seemed to throw any light on his present proceedings. And when
I pointed this out, he smilingly replied that I was in precisely the
same position as himself.

“We are not looking for corroborative evidence,” said he. “That
belongs to a later stage of the inquiry. We are looking for some
suggestive fact which may give us a hint where to begin. Naturally we
cannot form any guess as to what kind of fact that might be.”

It was not a very illuminating answer, but I had to accept it,
although I had a strong suspicion that Thorndyke’s purpose was not
quite so vague as he represented it to be, and determined
unobtrusively to keep an eye on his proceedings.

“Can I give you any assistance?” I enquired, craftily, when I had let
him into the hall and shut the outer door.

“Yes,” he replied, “there is one thing that you can do for me which
will be very helpful. I have brought a packet of cards with me”—here
he produced from his pocket a packet of stationer’s post-cards. “If
you will write on each of them the description and particulars of one
room with the name of the occupant in the case of bedrooms, and lay
the card on the mantelpiece of the room which it describes, I shall be
able to reconstitute the house as it was when it was inhabited. Then
we can each go about our respective businesses without hindering one
another.”

I took the cards—and the fairly broad hint—and together we made a
preliminary tour of the house, which, now that the furniture, carpets
and pictures were gone, looked very desolate and forlorn; and as it
had not been cleaned since the removal, it had a depressingly dirty
and squalid appearance. Moreover, in each room, a collection of
rubbish and discarded odds and ends had been roughly swept up on the
hearth, converting each fireplace into a sort of temporary dust-bin.

After a glance around the rooms on the ground floor, I made my way up
to the room in which Harold Monkhouse had died, which was my principal
concern as well as Thorndyke’s.

“Well, Mayfield,” the latter remarked, running a disparaging eye round
the faded, discoloured walls and the blackened ceiling, “you will have
to do something here. It is a shocking spectacle. Would you mind
roughly sketching out the position of the furniture? I see that the
bedstead stood by this wall with the head, I presume, towards the
window, and the bedside table about here, I suppose, at his right
hand. By the way, what was there on that table? Did he keep a supply
of food of any kind for use at night?”

“I think they usually put a little tin of sandwiches on the table when
the night preparations were made.”

“You say ‘they.’ Who put the box there?”

“I can’t say whose duty it was in particular. I imagine Barbara would
see to it when she was at home. In her absence it would be done by
Madeline or Mabel.”

“Not Wallingford?”

“No. I don’t think Wallingford ever troubled himself about any of the
domestic arrangements excepting those that concerned Barbara.”

“Do you know who made the sandwiches?”

“I think Madeline did, as a rule. I know she did sometimes.”

“And as to drink? I suppose he had a water-bottle, at any rate.”

“Yes, that was always there, and a little decanter of whiskey. But he
hardly ever touched that. Very often a small flagon of lemonade was
put on the table with the sandwiches.”

“And who made the lemonade?”

“Madeline. I know that, because it was a very special brand which no
one else could make.”

“And supposing the sandwiches and the lemonade were not consumed, do
you happen to know what became of the remainder?”

“I have no idea. Possibly the servants consumed them, but more
probably they were thrown away. Well-fed servants are not partial to
remainders from a sick-room.”

“You never heard of any attacks of illness among any of the servants?”

“Not to my knowledge. But I shouldn’t be very likely to, you know.”

“No. You notice, Mayfield, that you have mentioned one or two rather
material facts that were not disclosed at the inquest?”

“Yes. I was observing that. And it is just as well that they were not
disclosed. There were enough misleading facts without them.”

Thorndyke smiled indulgently. “You seem to have made up your mind
pretty definitely, on the negative side, at least,” he remarked; and
then, looking round once more at the walls with their faded, loosened
paper, he continued: “I take it that Mr. Monkhouse was not a fresh-air
enthusiast.”

“He was not,” I replied. “He didn’t much care for open windows,
especially at night. But how did you arrive at that fact?”

“I was looking at the wall-paper. This is not a damp house, but yet
the paper on the walls of this room is loosening and peeling off in
all directions. And if you notice the distribution of this tendency
you get the impression that the moisture which loosened the paper
proceeded from the neighbourhood of the bed. The wall which is most
affected is the one against which the bed stood; and the part of that
wall that has suffered most is that which was nearest to the occupant
of the bed, and especially to his head. That large piece, hanging
down, is just where the main stream of his breath would have
impinged.”

“Yes, I see the connection now you mention it; and yet I am surprised
that his breath alone should have made the air of the room so damp.
All through the winter season, when the window would be shut most
closely, the gas was burning; and at night, when the gas was out, he
commonly had his candle-lamp alight. I should have thought that the
gas and the candle together would have kept the air fairly dry.”

“That,” said Thorndyke, “is a common delusion. As a matter of fact
they would have quite the opposite effect. You have only to hold an
inverted tumbler over a burning candle to realize, from the moisture
which immediately condenses on the inside of the tumbler, that the
candle, as it burns, gives off quite a considerable volume of steam.
But of course, the bulk of the moisture which has caused the paper to
peel in this room came from the man’s own breath. However, we didn’t
come here for debating purposes. Let us complete our preliminary tour,
and when we have seen the whole house we can each make such more
detailed inspection as seems necessary for our particular purposes.”

We accordingly resumed our perambulation (but I noticed that Thorndyke
deposited his attaché case in Monkhouse’s room with the evident
intention of returning thither), both of us looking about narrowly:
Thorndyke, no doubt, in search of the mysterious “traces” of which he
had spoken, and I with an inquisitive endeavour to ascertain what kind
of objects or appearances he regarded as “traces.”

We had not gone very far before we encountered an object that even I
was able to recognize as significant. It was in a corner of the long
corridor that we came upon a little heap of rubbish that had been
swept up out of the way; and at the very moment when Thorndyke stopped
short with his eyes fixed on it, I saw the object—a little wisp of
knitting-wool of the well-remembered green colour. Thorndyke picked it
up, and, having exhibited it to me, produced from his letter-case a
little envelope such as seedsmen use, in which he put the treasure
trove, and as he uncapped his fountain pen, he looked up and down the
corridor.

“Which is the nearest room to this spot?” he asked.

“Madeline’s,” I replied. “That is the door of her bedroom, on the
right. But all the principal bedrooms are on this floor and Barbara’s
boudoir as well. This heap of rubbish is probably the sweepings from
all the rooms.”

“That is what it looks like,” he agreed as he wrote the particulars on
the envelope and slipped the latter in his letter-case. “You notice
that there are some other trifles in this heap—some broken glass, for
instance. But I will go through it when we have finished our tour,
though I may as well take this now.”

As he spoke, he stooped and picked up a short piece of rather
irregularly shaped glass rod with a swollen, rounded end.

“What is it?” I asked.

“It is a portion of a small glass pestle and it belongs to one of
those little glass mortars such as chemists use in rubbing up powders
into solutions or suspensions. You had better not touch it, though it
has probably been handled pretty freely. But I shall test it on the
chance of discovering what it was last used for.”

He put it away carefully in another seed-envelope and then looked down
thoughtfully at the miniature dust-heap; but he made no further
investigations at the moment and we resumed the perambulation, I
placing the identification card on the mantelpiece of each room while
he looked sharply about him, opening all cupboards and receptacles and
peering into their, usually empty, interiors.

When we had inspected the servants’ bedrooms and the attics—leaving
the indispensable cards—we went down to the basement and visited the
kitchen, the scullery, the servants’ parlour and the cellars; and this
brought our tour to an end.

“Now,” said Thorndyke, “we proceed from the general to the particular.
While you are drawing up your schedule of dilapidations I will just
browse about and see if I can pick up any stray crumbs in which
inference can find nourishment. It isn’t a very hopeful quest, but you
observe that we have already lighted on two objects which may have a
meaning for us.”

“Yes, we have ascertained that some one in this house used a
particular kind of wool and that some one possessed a glass mortar.
Those do not seem to me very weighty facts.”

“They are not,” he agreed; “indeed, they are hardly facts at all. The
actual fact is that we have found the things here. But trifles light
as air sometimes serve to fill up the spaces in a train of
circumstantial evidence. I think I will go and have another look at
that rubbish-heap.”

I was strongly tempted to follow him, but could hardly do so in face
of his plainly expressed wish to make his inspection alone. Moreover,
I had already seen that there was more to be done than I had supposed.
The house was certainly not in bad repair, but neither did it look
very fresh nor attractive. Furniture and especially pictures have a
way of marking indelibly the walls of a room, and the paintwork in
several places showed disfiguring traces of wear. But I was anxious to
let this house, even at a nominal rent, so that, by a few years’
normal occupation its sinister reputation might be forgotten and its
value restored.

As a result, I was committed to a detailed inspection of the whole
house and the making of voluminous notes on the repairs and
re-decorations which would be necessary to tempt even an impecunious
tenant to forget that this was a house in which a murder had been
committed. For that was the current view, erroneous as I believed it
to be. Note-book in hand, I proceeded systematically from room to room
and from floor to floor, and became so engrossed with my own business
that I almost forgot Thorndyke; though I could hear him moving about
the house, and once I met him—on the first floor, with a couple of
empty medicine bottles and a small glass jar in his hands, apparently
making his way to Harold’s room, where, as I have said, he had left
his attaché case.

That room I left to the last, as it was already entered in my list and
I did not wish to appear to spy upon Thorndyke’s proceedings. When, at
length, I entered the room I found that he, like myself, had come to
the end of his task. On the floor his attaché case lay open, crammed
with various objects, several of which appeared to be bottles, wrapped
in oddments of waste paper (including some pieces of wall paper which
he had apparently stripped off _ad hoc_ when the other supplies
failed) and among which I observed a crumpled fly-paper. Respecting
this I remarked: “I don’t see why you are burdening yourself with
this. A fly-paper is in no sense an incriminating object, even though
such things have, at times, been put to unlawful use.”

“Very true,” he replied as he peeled off the rubber gloves which he
had been wearing during the search. “A fly-paper is a perfectly normal
domestic object. But, as you say, it can on occasion be used as a
source of arsenic for criminal purposes; and a paper that has been so
used will be found to have had practically the whole of the arsenic
soaked out of it. As I happened to find this in the servants’ parlour,
it seemed worth while to take it to see whether its charge of arsenic
had or had not been extracted.”

“But,” I objected, “why on earth should the poisoner—if there really
is such a person—have been at the trouble of soaking out fly-papers
when, apparently he was able to command an unlimited supply of
Fowler’s Solution?”

“Quite a pertinent question, Mayfield,” he rejoined. “But may I ask my
learned friend whether he found the evidence relating to the Fowler’s
Solution perfectly satisfactory?”

“But surely!” I exclaimed. “You had the evidence of two expert
witnesses on the point. What more would you require? What is the
difficulty?”

“The difficulty is this. There were several witnesses who testified
that when they saw the bottle of medicine, the Fowler’s Solution had
not yet been added; but there was none who saw the bottle after the
addition had been made.”

“But it must have been added before Mabel gave the patient the last
dose.”

“That is the inference. But Mabel said nothing to that effect. She was
not asked what colour the medicine was when she gave the patient that
dose.”

“But what of the analysts and the post mortem?”

“As to the post mortem, the arsenic which was found in the stomach was
not recognized as being in the form of Fowler’s Solution; and as to
the analysts, they made their examination three days after the man
died.”

“Still, the medicine that they analysed was the medicine that deceased
had taken. You don’t deny that, do you?”

“I neither deny it nor affirm it. I merely say that no evidence was
given that proved the presence of Fowler’s Solution in that bottle
before the man died; and that the bottle which was handed to the
analysts was one that had been exposed for three days in a room which
had been visited by a number of persons, including Mrs. Monkhouse,
Wallingford, Miss Norris, Mabel Withers, Amos Monkhouse, Dr. Dimsdale
and yourself.”

“You mean to suggest that the bottle might have been tampered with or
changed for another? But, my dear Thorndyke, why in the name of God
should any one want to change the bottle?”

“I am not suggesting that the bottle actually was changed. I am merely
pointing out that the evidence of the analysts is material only
subject to the conditions that the bottle which they examined was the
bottle from which the last dose of medicine was given and that its
contents were the same as on that occasion; and that no conclusive
proof exists that it was the same bottle or that the contents were
unchanged.”

“But what reason could there be for supposing that it might have been
changed?”

“There is no need to advance any reason. The burden of proof lies on
those who affirm that it was the same bottle with the same contents.
It is for them to prove that no change was possible. But obviously a
change was possible.”

“But still,” I persisted, “there seems to be no point in this
suggestion. Who could have had any motive for making a change? And
what could the motive have been? It looks to me like mere
logic-chopping and hair-splitting.”

“You wouldn’t say that if you were for the defence,” chuckled
Thorndyke. “You would not let a point of first-rate importance pass on
a mere assumption, no matter how probable. And as to a possible
motive, surely a most obvious one is staring us in the face. Supposing
some person in this household had been administering arsenic in the
food. If it could be arranged that a poisonous dose could be
discovered in the medicine, you must see that the issue would be at
once transferred from the food to the medicine, and from those who
controlled the food to those who controlled the medicine. Which is, in
fact, what happened. As soon as the jury heard about the medicine,
their interest in the food became extinct.”

I listened to this exposition with a slightly sceptical smile. It was
all very ingenious but I found it utterly unconvincing.

“You ought to be pleading in court, Thorndyke,” I said, “instead of
grubbing about in empty houses and raking over rubbish-heaps. By the
way, have you found anything that seems likely to yield any
suggestions?”

“It is a little difficult to say,” he replied. “I have taken
possession of a number of bottles and small jars for examination as to
their contents, but I have no great expectation in respect of them. I
also found some fragments of the glass mortar—an eight-ounce mortar it
appears to have been.”

“Where did you find those?” I asked.

“In Miss Norris’s bedroom, in a little pile of rubbish under the
grate. They are only tiny fragments, but the curvature enables one to
reconstruct the vessel pretty accurately.”

It seemed to me a rather futile proceeding, but I made no comment. Nor
did I give utterance to a suspicion which had just flashed into my
mind, that it was the discovery of these ridiculous fragments of glass
that had set my learned friend splitting straws on the subject of the
medicine bottle. I had not much liked his suggestion as to the
possible motive of that hypothetical substitution, and I liked it less
now that he had discovered the remains of the mortar in Madeline’s
room. There was no doubt that Thorndyke had a remarkable constructive
imagination; and, as I followed him down the stairs and out into the
square, I found myself faintly uneasy lest that lively imagination
should carry him into deeper waters than I was prepared to navigate in
his company.



Chapter XIII

Rupert Makes Some Discoveries

By a sort of tacit understanding Thorndyke and I parted in the
vicinity of South Kensington Station, to which he had made a bee line
on leaving the square. As he had made no suggestion that I should go
back with him, I inferred that he had planned a busy evening examining
and testing the odds and ends that he had picked up in the empty
house; while I had suddenly conceived the idea that I might as well
take the opportunity of calling on Madeline, who might feel neglected
if I failed to put in an appearance within a reasonable time after my
return to town. Our researches had taken up most of the afternoon and
it was getting on for the hour at which Madeline usually left the
school; and as the latter was less than half-an-hour’s walk from the
station, I could reach it in good time without hurrying.

As I walked at an easy pace through the busily populated streets, I
turned over the events of the afternoon with rather mixed feelings. In
spite of my great confidence in Thorndyke, I was sensible of a chill
of disappointment in respect alike of his words and his deeds. In this
rather farcical grubbing about in the dismantled house there was a
faint suggestion of charlatanism; of the vulgar, melodramatic sleuth,
nosing out a trail; while, as to his hair-splitting objections to a
piece of straightforward evidence, they seemed to me to be of the kind
at which the usual hard-headed judge would shake his hard head while
grudgingly allowing them as technically admissible.

But whither was Thorndyke drifting? Evidently he had turned a dubious
eye on Wallingford; and that egregious ass seemed to be doing all that
he could to attract further notice. But to-day I had seemed to detect
a note of suspicion in regard to Madeline; and even making allowance
for the fact that he had not my knowledge of her gentle, gracious
personality, I could not but feel a little resentful. Once more,
Wallingford’s remarks concerning a possible mare’s nest and a public
scandal recurred to me, and, not for the first time, I was aware of
faint misgivings as to my wisdom in having set Thorndyke to stir up
these troubled waters. He had, indeed, given me fair warning, and I
was half-inclined to regret that I had not allowed myself to be warned
off. Of course, Thorndyke was much too old a hand to launch a
half-prepared prosecution into the air. But still, I could not but ask
myself uneasily whither his overacute inferences were leading him.

These reflections brought me to the gate of the school, where I
learned from the porter that Madeline had not yet left and accordingly
sent up my card. In less than a minute she appeared, dressed in her
out-of-door clothes and wreathed in smiles, looking, I thought, very
charming.

“How nice of you, Rupert!” she exclaimed, “to come and take me home. I
was wondering how soon you would come to see my little spinster lair.
It is only a few minutes’ walk from here. But I am sorry I didn’t know
you were coming, for I have arranged to make a call—a business
call—and I am due in about ten minutes. Isn’t it a nuisance?”

“How long will you have to stay?”

“Oh, a quarter of an hour, at least. Perhaps a little more.”

“Very well. I will wait outside for you and do sentry-go.”

“No, you won’t. I shall let you into my flat—I should have to pass
it—and you can have a wash and brush-up, and then you can prowl about
and see how you like my little mansion—I haven’t quite settled down in
it yet, but you must overlook that. By the time you have inspected
everything, I shall be back and then we can consider whether we will
have a late tea or an early supper. This is the way.”

She led me into a quiet by-street, one side of which was occupied by a
range of tall, rather forbidding buildings whose barrack-like aspect
was to some extent mitigated by signs of civilized humanity in the
tastefully curtained windows. Madeline’s residence was on the second
floor, and when she had let me in by the diminutive outer door and
switched on the light, she turned back to the staircase with a wave of
her hand.

“I will be back as soon as I can,” she said. “Meanwhile go in and make
yourself at home.”

I stood at the door and watched her trip lightly down the stairs until
she disappeared round the angle, when I shut the door and proceeded to
follow her injunctions to the letter by taking possession of the
bathroom, in which I was gratified to find a constant supply of hot
water. When I had refreshed myself by a wash, I went forth and made a
leisurely survey of the little flat. It was all very characteristic of
Madeline, the professional exponent of Domestic Economy, in its
orderly arrangement and its evidences of considered convenience. The
tiny kitchen reminded one of a chemical laboratory or a doctor’s
dispensary with its labelled jars of the cook’s materials set out in
ordered rows on their shelves, and the two little mortars, one of
Wedgewood ware and the other of glass. I grinned as my eye lighted on
this latter and I thought of the fragments carefully collected by
Thorndyke and solemnly transported to the Temple for examination.
Here, if he could have seen it, was evidence that proved the ownership
of that other mortar and at the same time demolished the significance
of that discovery.

I ventured to inspect the bedroom, and a very trim, pleasant little
room it was; but the feature which principally attracted my attention
was an arrangement for switching the electric light off and on from
the bed—an arrangement suspiciously correlated to a small set of
bookshelves also within easy reach of the bed. What interested me in
it was what Thorndyke would have called its “unmechanical ingenuity”;
for it consisted of no more than a couple of lengths of stout string,
of each of which one end was tied to the light-switch and the other
end led by a pair of screw-eyes to the head of the bed. No doubt the
simple device worked well enough in spite of the friction at each
screw-eye, but a man of less intelligence than Madeline would probably
have used levers or bell-cranks, or at least pulleys to diminish the
friction in changing the direction of the pull.

There was a second bedroom, at present unoccupied and only partially
furnished and serving, apparently, as a receptacle for such of
Madeline’s possessions as had not yet had a permanent place assigned
to them. Here were one or two chairs, some piles of books, a number of
pictures and several polished wood boxes and cases of various sizes;
evidently the residue of the goods and chattels that Madeline had
brought from her home and stored somewhere while she was living at
Hilborough Square. I ran my eye along the range of boxes, which were
set out on the top of a chest of drawers. One was an old-fashioned
tea-caddy, another an obvious folding desk of the same period, while a
third, which I opened, turned out to be a work-box of mid-Victorian
age. Beside it was a little flat rosewood case which looked like a
small case of mathematical instruments. Observing that the key was in
the lock, I turned it and lifted the lid, not with any conscious
curiosity as to what was inside it, but in the mere idleness of a man
who has nothing in particular to do. But the instant that the lid was
up my attention awoke with a bound and I stood with dropped jaw
staring at the interior in utter consternation.

There could be not an instant’s doubt as to what this case was, for
its green-baize-lined interior showed a shaped recess of the exact
form of a pocket pistol; and, if that were not enough, there, in its
own compartment was a little copper powder-flask, and in another
compartment about a dozen globular bullets.

I snapped down the lid and turned the key and walked guiltily out of
the room. My interest in Madeline’s flat was dead. I could think of
nothing but this amazing discovery. And the more I thought, the more
overpowering did it become. The pistol that fitted that case was the
exact counterpart of the pistol that I had seen in Thorndyke’s
laboratory; and the case, itself, corresponded exactly to his
description of the case from which that pistol had probably been
taken. It was astounding; and it was profoundly disturbing. For it
admitted of no explanation that I could bring myself to accept other
than that of a coincidence. And coincidences are unsatisfactory
things; and you can’t do with too many of them at once.

Yet, on reflection, this was the view that I adopted. Indeed, there
was no thinkable alternative. And really, when I came to turn the
matter over, it was not quite so extraordinary as it had seemed at the
first glance. For what, after all, was this pistol with its case? It
was not a unique thing. It was not even a rare thing. Thorndyke had
spoken of these pistols and cases as comparatively common things with
which he expected me to be familiar. Thousands of them must have been
made in their time, and since they were far from perishable, thousands
of them must still exist. The singularity of the coincidence was not
in the facts; it was the product of my own state of mind.

Thus I sought—none too successfully—to rid myself of the effects of
the shock that I had received on raising the lid of the case; and I
was still moodily gazing out of the sitting room window and arguing
away my perturbation when I heard the outer door shut and a moment
later Madeline looked into the room.

“I haven’t been so very long, have I?” she said, cheerily. “Now I will
slip off my cloak and hat and we will consider what sort of meal we
will have; or perhaps you will consider the question while I am gone.”

With this she flitted away; and my thoughts, passing by the problem
submitted, involuntarily reverted to the little rosewood case in the
spare room. But her absence was of a brevity suggesting the
performance of the professional quick-change artist. In a minute or
two I heard her approach and open the door; and I turned—to receive a
real knock-out blow.

I was so astonished and dismayed that I suppose I must have stood
staring like a fool, for she asked in a rather disconcerted tone:

“What is the matter, Rupert? Why are you looking at my jumper like
that? Don’t you like it?”

“Yes,” I stammered, “of course I do. Most certainly. Very charming.
Very—er—becoming. I like it—er—exceedingly.”

“I don’t believe you do,” she said, doubtfully, “you looked so
surprised when I first came in. You don’t think the colour too
startling, do you? Women wear brighter colours than they used to, you
know, and I do think this particular shade of green is rather nice.
And it is rather unusual, too.”

“It is,” I agreed, recovering myself by an effort. “Quite
distinctive.” And then, noting that I had unconsciously adopted
Thorndyke’s own expression, I added, hastily, “And I shouldn’t
describe it as startling, at all. It is in perfectly good taste.”

“I am glad you think that,” she said, “for you certainly did look
rather startled at first, and I had some slight misgivings about it
myself when I had finished it. It looked more brilliant in colour as a
garment than it did in the form of mere skeins.”

“You made it yourself, then?”

“Yes. But I don’t think I would ever knit another. It took me months
to do, and I could have bought one for very little more than the cost
of the wool, though, of course, I shouldn’t have been able to select
the exact tint that I wanted. But what about our meal? Shall we call
it tea or supper?”

She could have called it breakfast for all I cared, so completely had
this final shock extinguished my interest in food. But I had to make
some response to her eager hospitality.

“Let us split the difference or strike an average,” I replied. “We
will call it a ‘swarry’—tea and unusual trimmings.”

“Very well,” said she, “then you shall come to the kitchen and help. I
will show you the raw material of the feast and you shall dictate the
bill of fare.”

We accordingly adjourned to the kitchen where she fell to work on the
preparations with the unhurried quickness that is characteristic of
genuine efficiency, babbling pleasantly and pausing now and then to
ask my advice (which was usually foolish and had to be blandly
rejected) and treating the whole business with a sort of playful
seriousness that was very delightful. And all the time I looked on in
a state of mental chaos and bewilderment for which I can find no
words. There she was, my friend, Madeline, sweet, gentle, feminine—the
very type of gracious womanhood, and the more sweet and gracious by
reason of these homely surroundings. For it is an appalling
reflection, in these days of lady professors and women legislators,
that to masculine eyes a woman never looks so dignified, so
worshipful, so entirely desirable, as when she is occupied in the
traditional activities that millenniums of human experience have
associated with her sex. To me, Madeline, flitting about the
immaculate little kitchen, neat-handed, perfect in the knowledge of
her homely craft; smiling, dainty, fragile, with her gracefully
flowing hair and the little apron that she had slipped on as a sort of
ceremonial garment, was a veritable epitome of feminine charm. And
yet, but a few feet away was a rosewood case that had once held a
pistol; and even now, in Thorndyke’s locked cabinet—but my mind
staggered under the effort of thought and refused the attempt to
combine and collate a set of images so discordant.

“You are very quiet, Rupert,” she said, presently, pausing to look at
me. “What is it? I hope you haven’t any special worries.”

“We all have our little worries, Madeline,” I replied, vaguely.

“Yes, indeed,” said she, still regarding me thoughtfully; and for the
first time I noticed that she seemed to have aged a little since I had
last seen her and that her face, in repose, showed traces of strain
and anxiety. “We all have our troubles and we all try to put them on
you. How did you think Barbara was looking?”

“Extraordinarily well. I was agreeably surprised.”

“Yes. She is wonderful. I am full of admiration of the way she has put
away everything connected with—with that dreadful affair. I couldn’t
have done it if I had been in her place. I couldn’t have let things
rest. I should have wanted to know.”

“I have no doubt that she does. We all want to know. But she can do no
more than the rest of us. Do you ever see Wallingford now?”

“Oh, dear, yes. He was inclined to be rather too attentive at first,
but Barbara gave him a hint that spinsters who live alone don’t want
too many visits from their male friends, so now he usually comes with
her.”

“I must bear Barbara’s words of wisdom in mind,” said I.

“Indeed you won’t!” she exclaimed. “Don’t be ridiculous, Rupert. You
know her hint doesn’t apply to you. And I shouldn’t have troubled
about the proprieties in Tony’s case if I had really wanted him. But I
didn’t, though I am awfully sorry for him.”

“Yes, he seems to be in a bad way mentally, poor devil. Of course you
have heard about his delusions?”

“If they really are delusions, but I am not at all sure that they are.
Now help me to carry these things into the sitting room and then I
will do the omelette and bring it in.”

I obediently took up the tray and followed her into the sitting room,
where I completed the arrangement of the table while she returned to
the kitchen to perform the crowning culinary feat. In a minute or two
she came in with the product under a heated cover and we took our
seats at the table.

“You were speaking of Wallingford,” said I. “Apparently you know more
about him than I do. It seemed to me that he was stark mad.”

“He is queer enough, I must admit—don’t let your omelette get cold—but
I think you and Barbara are mistaken about his delusions. I suspect
that somebody is really keeping him under observation; and if that is
so, one can easily understand why his nerves are so upset.”

“Yes, indeed. But when you say you suspect that we are mistaken, what
does that mean? Is it just a pious opinion or have you something to go
upon?”

“Oh, I shouldn’t offer a mere pious opinion to a learned counsel,” she
replied, with a smile. “I have something to go upon, and I will tell
you about it, though I expect you will think I am stark mad, too. The
fact is that I have been under observation, too.”

“Nonsense, Madeline,” I exclaimed. “The thing is absurd. You have let
Wallingford infect you.”

“There!” she retorted. “What did I say? You think I am qualifying for
an asylum now. But I am not. Absurd as the thing seems—and I quite
agree with you on that point—it is an actual fact. I haven’t the
slightest doubt about it.”

“Well,” I said, “I am open to conviction. But let us have your actual
facts. How long do you think it has been going on?”

“That I can’t say; and I don’t think it is going on now at all. At any
rate, I have seen no signs of any watcher for more than a week, and I
keep a pretty sharp lookout. The way I first became aware of it was
this: I happened one day at lunch time to be looking out of this
window through the chink in the curtains when I saw a man pass along
slowly on the other side of the street and glance up, as it seemed, at
this window. I didn’t notice him particularly, but still I did look at
him when he glanced up, and of course, his face was then directly
towards me. Now it happened that, a few minutes afterwards, I looked
out again; and then I saw what looked like the same man pass along
again, at the same slow pace and in the same direction. And again he
looked up at the window, though he couldn’t have seen me because I was
hidden by the curtain. But this time I looked at him very closely and
made careful mental notes of his clothing, his hat and his features,
because, you see, I remembered what Tony had said and I hadn’t
forgotten the way I was treated at the inquest or the way in which
that detective man had turned out my cupboard when he came to search
the house. So I looked this man over very carefully indeed so that I
should recognize him without any doubt if I should see him again.

“Well, before I went out after lunch I had a good look out of the
window, but I couldn’t see anything of him; nor did I see him on my
way to the school, though I stopped once or twice and looked back.
When I got to the school I stopped at the gate and looked along the
street both ways, but still there was no sign of him. Then I ran up to
a class-room window from which I could see up and down the street; and
presently I saw him coming along slowly on the school side and I was
able to check him off point by point, and though he didn’t look up
this time, I could see his face and check that off, too. There was no
doubt whatever that it was the same man.

“When I came out of school that afternoon I looked round but could not
see him, so I walked away quickly in the direction that I usually take
when going home, but suddenly turned a corner and slipped into a shop.
I stayed there a few minutes buying some things, then I came out, and,
seeing no one, slipped round the corner and took my usual way home but
kept carefully behind a man and a woman who were going the same way. I
hadn’t gone very far before I saw my man standing before a shop window
but evidently looking up and down the street. I was quite close to him
before he saw me and of course I did not appear to notice him; but I
hurried home without looking round and ran straight up to this window
to watch for him. And sure enough, in about a couple of minutes I saw
him come down the street and walk slowly past.”

“And did you see him again after that?”

“Yes, I saw him twice more that same day. I went out for a walk in the
evening on purpose to give him a lead. And I saw him from time to time
every day for about ten days. Then I missed him, and I haven’t seen a
sign of him for more than a week. I suppose he found me too monotonous
and gave me up.”

“It is very extraordinary,” I said, convinced against my will by her
very circumstantial description. “What possible object could any one
have in keeping a watch on you?”

“That is what I have wondered,” said she. “But I suppose the police
have to do something for their pay.”

“But this doesn’t quite look like a police proceeding. There is
something rather feeble and amateurish about the affair. With all due
respect to your powers of observation, Madeline, I don’t think a
Scotland Yard man would have let himself be spotted quite so easily.”

“But who else could it be?” she objected; and then, after a pause, she
added with a mischievous smile, “unless it should be your friend, Dr.
Thorndyke. That would really be a quaint situation—if I should, after
all, be indebted to you, Rupert, for these polite attentions.”

I brushed the suggestion aside hastily but with no conviction. And
once more I recalled Wallingford’s observations on mare’s nests.
Obviously this clumsy booby was not a professional detective. And if
not, what could he be but some hired agent of Thorndyke’s. It was one
more perplexity, and added to those with which my mind was already
charged, it reduced me to moody silence which must have made me the
very reverse of an exhilarating companion. Indeed, when Madeline had
rallied me once or twice on my gloomy preoccupation, I felt that the
position was becoming untenable. I wanted to be alone and think things
out; but as it would have been hardly decent to break up our little
party and take my departure, I determined, if possible, to escape from
this oppressive tête-à-tête. Fortunately, I remembered that a famous
pianist was giving a course of recitals at a hall within easy walking
distance and ventured to suggest that we might go and hear him.

“I would rather stay here and gossip with you,” she replied, “but as
you don’t seem to be in a gossiping humour, perhaps the music might be
rather nice. Yes, let us go. I don’t often hear any good music
nowadays.”

Accordingly we went, and on the way to the hall Madeline gave me a few
further details of her experiences with her follower; and I was not a
little impressed by her wariness and the ingenuity with which she had
lured that guileless sleuth into exposed and well-lighted situations.

“By the way,” said I, “what was the fellow like? Give me a few
particulars of his appearance in case I should happen to run across
him.”

“Good Heavens, Rupert!” she exclaimed, laughing mischievously, “you
don’t suppose he will take to haunting you, do you? That would really
be the last straw, especially if he should happen to be employed by
Dr. Thorndyke.”

“It would,” I admitted with a faint grin, “though Thorndyke is
extremely thorough and he plumes himself on keeping an open mind. At
any rate, let us have a few details.”

“There was nothing particularly startling about him. He was a
medium-sized man, rather fair, with a longish, sharp, turned-up nose
and a sandy moustache, rather bigger than men usually have nowadays.
He was dressed in a blue serge suit, without an overcoat and he wore a
brown soft felt hat, a turn-down collar and a dark green necktie with
white spots. He had no gloves but he carried a walking-stick—a
thickish yellow cane with a crooked handle.”

“Not very distinctive,” I remarked, disparagingly.

“Don’t you think so?” said she. “I thought he was rather easy to
recognize with that brown hat and the blue suit and the big moustache
and pointed nose. Of course, if he had worn a scarlet hat and
emerald-green trousers and carried a brass fire-shovel instead of a
walking-stick he would have been still easier to recognize; but you
mustn’t expect too much, even from a detective.”

I looked with dim surprise into her smiling face and was more
bewildered than ever. If she were haunted by any gnawing anxieties,
she had a wonderful way of throwing them off. Nothing could be less
suggestive of a guilty conscience than this quiet gaiety and placid
humour. However, there was no opportunity for moralizing, for her
little retort had brought us to the door of the hall; and we had
barely time to find desirable seats before the principal musician took
his place at the instrument.

It was a delightful entertainment; and if the music did not “sooth my
savage breast” into complete forgetfulness, it occupied my attention
sufficiently to hinder consecutive thought on any other subject.
Indeed, it was not until I had said “good night” to Madeline outside
her flat and turned my face towards the neighbouring station that I
was able to attempt a connected review of the recent startling
discoveries.

What could they possibly mean? The pistol alone could have been argued
away as a curious coincidence, and the same might have been possible
even in the case of the wool. But the two together! The long arm of
coincidence was not long enough for that. The wisp of wool that we had
found in the empty house was certainly—admittedly—Madeline’s. But that
wisp matched identically the ball of wool from the pistol; and here
was a missing pistol which was certainly the exact counterpart of that
which had contained the wool plug. The facts could not be disputed.
Was it possible to escape from the inferences which they yielded?

The infernal machine, feeble as it was, gave evidence of a diabolical
intention—an intention that my mind utterly refused to associate with
Madeline. And yet, even in the moment of rejection, my memory suddenly
recalled the arrangement connected with the electric light switch in
Madeline’s bedroom. Its mechanism was practically identical with that
of the infernal machine, and the materials used—string and
screw-eyes—were actually the same. It seemed impossible to escape from
this proof piled on proof.

But if the machine itself declared an abominable intention, what of
that which lay behind the machine? The sending of that abomination was
not an isolated or independent act. It was related to some antecedent
act, as Thorndyke had implied. Whoever sent it, had a guilty
conscience.

But guilty of what?

As I asked myself this question, and the horrid, inevitable answer
framed itself in my mind, I turned automatically from Middle Temple
Lane and passed into the deep shadow of the arch that gives entrance
to Elm Court.



Chapter XIV

Rupert Confides in Thorndyke

Although few of its buildings (excepting the Halls) are of really
great antiquity, the precinct of the Temples shares with the older
parts of London at least one medieval characteristic: it abounds in
those queer little passages and alleys which, burrowing in all
directions under the dwelling-houses, are a source of endless
confusion and bewilderment to the stranger, though to the accustomed
denizen they offer an equally great convenience. For by their use the
seasoned Templar makes his way from any one part of the precinct to
any other, if not in an actual bee-line, at least in an abbreviated
zig-zag that cuts across the regular thoroughfares as though they were
mere paths traversing an open meadow. Some of these alleys do, indeed,
announce themselves even to unaccustomed eyes, as public passage-ways,
by recognizable entrance arches; but many of them scorn even this
degree of publicity, artfully concealing their existence from the
uninitiated by an ordinary doorway, which they share with a pair of
houses. Whereby the unsuspecting stranger, entering what, in his
innocence, he supposes to be the front doorway of a house, walks along
the hall and is presently astonished to find himself walking out of
another front door into another thoroughfare.

The neighbourhood of Fig Tree Court is peculiarly rich in these
deceptive burrows, indeed, excepting from the Terrace, it has no other
avenue of approach. On the present occasion I had the choice of two,
and was proceeding along the narrow lane of Elm Court to take the
farther one, which led to the entry of my chambers, when I caught
sight of a man approaching hurriedly from the direction of the
Cloisters. At the first glance, I thought I recognized him—though he
was a mere silhouette in the dim light—as the loiterer whom I had seen
on the night of my return. And his behaviour confirmed my suspicion;
for as he came in sight of me, he hesitated for a moment and then,
quickening his pace forward, disappeared suddenly through what
appeared to be a hole in the wall but was, in fact, the passage for
which I was making.

Instantly, I turned back and swiftly crossing the square of Elm Court,
dived into the burrow at its farther corner and came out into the
little square of Fig Tree Court at the very moment when the mysterious
stranger emerged from the burrow at the other side, so that we met
face to face in the full light of the central lamp.

Naturally, I was the better prepared for the encounter and I pursued
my leisurely way towards my chambers with the air of not having
observed him; while he, stopping short for a moment with a wild stare
at me, dashed across the square and plunged into the passage from
which I had just emerged.

I did not follow him. I had seen him and had thereby confirmed a
suspicion that had been growing upon me, and that was enough. For I
need hardly say that the man was Anthony Wallingford. But though I was
prepared for the identification, I was none the less puzzled and
worried by it. Here was yet another perplexity; and I was just
stepping into my entry to reflect upon it at my leisure when I became
aware of hurrying footsteps in the passage through which Wallingford
had come. Quickly drawing back into the deep shadow of the vestibule,
I waited to see who this new-comer might be. In a few seconds he
rushed out of the passage and came to a halt in the middle of the
square, nearly under the lamp, where he stood for a few moments,
looking to right and left and listening intently. And now I realized
the justice of what Madeline had said; for, commonplace as the man
was, I recognized him in an instant. Brown hat, blue serge suit, big,
sandy moustache and concave, pointed nose; they were not sensational
characteristics, but they identified him beyond a moment’s doubt.

Apparently, his ear must have caught the echoes of Wallingford’s
footsteps, for, after a very brief pause, he started off at something
approaching a trot and disappeared into the passage by which I had
come and Wallingford had gone. A sudden, foolish curiosity impelled me
to follow and observe the methods of this singular and artless sleuth.
But I did not follow directly. Instead, I turned and ran up the other
passage, which leads into the narrow part of Elm Court; and as I came
flying out of the farther end of it I ran full tilt into a man who was
running along the court towards the Cloisters. Of course the man was
Wallingford. Who else would be running like a lunatic through the
Temple at night, unless it were his pursuer?

With muttered curses but no word of recognition, he disengaged himself
and pursued his way, disappearing at length round the sharp turn in
the lane which leads towards the Cloisters. I did not follow him, but
drew back into the dark passage and waited. Very soon another figure
became visible, approaching rapidly along the dimly lighted lane. I
drew farther back and presently from my hiding-place I saw the
brown-hatted shadower steal past with a ridiculous air of secrecy and
caution; and when he had passed, I peered out and watched his receding
figure until it disappeared round the angle of the lane.

I felt half-tempted to join the absurd procession and see what
eventually became of these two idiots. But I had really seen enough. I
now knew that Wallingford’s “delusions” were no delusions at all and
that Madeline’s story set forth nothing but the genuine, indisputable
truth. And with these new facts to add to my unwelcome store of data,
I walked slowly back to my chambers, cogitating as I went.

In truth, I had abundant material for reflection. The more I turned
over my discoveries in Madeline’s flat the more did the incriminating
evidence seem to pile up. I recalled Polton’s plainly expressed
suspicion that the sender of the infernal machine was a woman; and I
recalled Thorndyke’s analysis of the peculiarities of the thing with
the inferences which those peculiarities suggested, and read into them
a more definite meaning. I now saw what the machine had conveyed to
him, and what he had been trying to make it convey to me. The
unmechanical outlook combined with evident ingenuity, the
unfamiliarity with ordinary mechanical appliances, the ignorance
concerning the different kinds of gun-powder, the lack of those common
tools which nearly every man, but hardly any woman, possesses and can
use: all these peculiarities of the unknown person were feminine
peculiarities. And finally, there had been the plug of knitting-wool:
a most unlikely material for a man to use for such a purpose, or,
indeed, to possess at all.

So my thoughts went over and over the same ground, and every time
finding escape from the obvious conclusion more and more impossible.
The evidence of Madeline’s complicity—at the very least—in the sending
of the infernal machine appeared overwhelming. I could not reject it.
Nor could I deny what the sending of it implied. It was virtually a
confession of guilt. And yet, even as I admitted this to myself, I was
strangely enough aware that my feelings towards Madeline remained
unaltered. The rational, legal side of me condemned her. But somehow,
in some incomprehensible way, that condemnation had a purely
technical, academic quality. It left my loyalty and affection for her
untouched.

But what of Thorndyke? Had his reasoning travelled along the same
lines? If it had, there would be nothing sentimental in _his_
attitude. He had warned me, and I knew well enough that whenever there
should be evidence enough to put before a court, the law would be set
in motion. What, then, was his present position? And even as I asked
myself the question, there echoed uncomfortably in my mind the
significant suggestion that he had thrown out only a few hours ago
concerning the bottle of medicine. Evidently, he at least entertained
the possibility that the Fowler’s Solution had been put into that
bottle after Monkhouse’s death, and that for the express purpose of
diverting suspicion from the food. The manifest implication was that
he entertained the possibility that the poison had been administered
in the food. But to suspect this was to suspect the person who
prepared the food of being the poisoner. And the person who prepared
the food was Madeline.

The question, therefore, as to Thorndyke’s state of mind was a vital
one. He had expressed no suspicion of Madeline. But then he had
expressed no suspicion of anybody. On the other hand, he had
exonerated nobody. He was frankly observant of every member of that
household. Then there was the undeniable fact that Madeline had been
watched and followed. Somebody suspected her. But who? The watcher was
certainly not a detective. Amateur was writ large all over him. Then
it was not the police who suspected her. Apparently there remained
only Thorndyke, though one would have expected him to employ a more
efficient agent.

But Wallingford was also under observation, and more persistently.
Then he, too, was suspected. But here there was some show of reason.
For what was Wallingford doing in the Temple? Evidently he had been
lurking about, apparently keeping a watch on Thorndyke, though for
what purpose I could not imagine. Still, it was a suspicious
proceeding and justified some watch being kept on him. But the
shadowing of Madeline was incomprehensible.

I paced up and down my sitting room turning these questions over in my
mind and all the time conscious of a curious sense of unreality in the
whole affair; in all this watching and following and dodging which
looked so grotesque and purposeless. I felt myself utterly bewildered.
But I was also profoundly unhappy and, indeed, overshadowed by a
terrible dread. For out of this chaos one fact emerged clearly: there
was a formidable body of evidence implicating Madeline. If Thorndyke
had known what I knew, her position would have been one of the gravest
peril. My conscience told me that it was my duty to tell him; and I
knew that I had no intention of doing anything of the kind. But still
the alarming question haunted me: how much did he really know? How
much did he suspect?

In the course of my perambulations I passed and repassed a smallish
deed box which stood on a lower book-shelf and which was to me what
the Ark of the Covenant was to the ancient Israelites: the repository
of my most sacred possessions. Its lid bore the name “Stella,” painted
on it by me, and its contents were a miscellany of trifles, worthless
intrinsically, but to me precious beyond all price as relics of the
dear friend who had been all in all to me during her short life and
who, though she had been lying in her grave for four long years, was
all in all to me still. Often, in the long, solitary evenings, had I
taken the relics out of their abiding-place and let the sight of them
carry my thoughts back to the golden days of our happy companionship,
filling in the pleasant pictures with the aid of my diary—but that was
unnecessary now, since I knew the entries by heart—and painting other,
more shadowy pictures of a future that might have been. It was a
melancholy pleasure, perhaps, but yet, as the years rolled on, the
bitterness of those memories grew less bitter and still the sweet
remained.

Presently, as for the hundredth time the beloved name met my eye,
there came upon me a yearning to creep back with her into the sunny
past; to forget, if only for a short hour, the hideous anxieties of
the present and in memory to walk with her once more “along the meads
of asphodel.”

Halting before the box, I stood and lifted it tenderly to the table
and having unlocked it, raised the lid and looked thoughtfully into
the interior. Then, one by one, I lifted out my treasures, set them
out in order on the table and sat down to look at them and let them
speak to me their message of peace and consolation.

To a stranger’s eye they were a mere collection of odds and ends. Some
would have been recognizable as relics of the more conventional type.
There were several photographs of the dead girl, some taken by myself,
and a tress of red-gold hair—such hair as I had been told often
glorifies the victims whom consumption had marked for its own. It had
been cut off for me by Barbara when she took her own tress, and tied
up with a blue ribbon. But it was not these orthodox relics that spoke
to me most intimately. I had no need of their aid to call up the
vision of her person. The things that set my memory working were the
records of actions and experiences; the sketch-books, the loose
sketches and the little plaster plaques and medallions that she had
made with my help after she had become bed-ridden and could go no more
abroad to sketch. Every one of these had its story to tell, its vision
to call up.

I turned over the sketches—simple but careful pencil drawings for the
most part, for Stella, like me, had more feeling for form than for
colour—and recalled the making of them; the delightful rambles across
the sunny meadows or through the cool woodlands, the solemn planting
of sketching-stools and earnest consultation on the selection and
composition of the subjects. These were the happiest days, before the
chilly hand of the destroyer had been laid on its chosen victim and
there was still a long and sunny future to be vaguely envisaged.

And then I turned to the little plaques and medallions which she had
modelled and under my supervision and of which I had made the plaster
moulds and casts. These called up sadder memories, but yet they spoke
of an even closer and more loving companionship; for each work was, in
a way, a joint achievement over which we had triumphed and rejoiced
together. So it happened that, although the shadow of sickness, and at
last of death, brooded over them, it was on these relics that I tended
to linger most lovingly.

Here was the slate that I had got for her to stick the clay on and
which she used to hold propped up against her knees as she worked with
never-failing enthusiasm through the long, monotonous days, and even,
when she was well enough, far into the night by the light of the
shaded candle. Here were the simple modelling-tools and the little
sponge and the Camel-hair brush with which she loved to put the final
finish on the damp clay reliefs. Here was Lanterri’s priceless
text-book over which we used to pore together and laud that
incomparable teacher. Here were the plaques, medals and medallions
that we had prised out, with bated breath, from their too-adherent
moulds. And here—the last and saddest relic—was the wax mould from
which no cast had ever been made, the final, crowning work of those
deft, sensitive fingers.

For the thousandth time, I picked it up and let the light fall
obliquely across its hollows. The work was a medal some three inches
across, a portrait of Stella, herself, modelled from a profile
photograph that I had taken for the purpose. It was an excellent
likeness and unquestionably the best piece of modelling that she had
ever done.

Often, I had intended to take the cast from it, but always had been
restrained by a vague reluctance to disturb the mould. Now, as I
looked at the delicate, sunken impression, I had again the feeling
that this, her last work, ought to be finished; and I was still
debating the matter with the mould in my hand when I heard a quick
step upon the stair, followed by a characteristic knock on my door.

My first impulse was to hustle my treasures back into their box before
answering the summons. But this was almost instantly followed by a
revulsion. I recognized the knock as Thorndyke’s; and somehow there
came upon me a desire to share my memories with him. He had shown a
strangely sympathetic insight into my feelings towards Stella. He had
read my diary. He now knew the whole story; and he was the kindest,
the most loyal and most discreet of friends. Gently laying down the
mould I went to the door and threw it open.

“I saw your light burning as I passed just now,” said Thorndyke as he
entered and shook my hand warmly, “so I thought I would take the
opportunity to drop in and return your diary. I hope I am not
disturbing you. If I am, you must treat me as a friend and eject me.”

“Not at all, Thorndyke,” I replied. “On the contrary, you would be
doing me a charity if you would stay and smoke a companionable pipe.”

“Good,” said he, “then I will give myself the pleasure of a quiet
gossip. But what is amiss, Mayfield?” he continued, laying a friendly
hand on my shoulder and looking me over critically. “You look worn,
and worried and depressed. You are not letting your mind dwell too
much, I hope, on the tragedy that has come unbidden into your life?”

“I am afraid I am,” I replied. “The horrible affair haunts me.
Suspicion and mystery are in the very air I breathe. A constant menace
seems to hang over all my friends, so that I am in continual dread of
some new catastrophe. I have just ascertained that Wallingford is
really being watched and shadowed; and not only Wallingford but even
Miss Norris.”

He did not appear surprised or seek for further information. He merely
nodded and looked into my face with grave sympathy.

“Put it away, Mayfield,” said he. “That is my counsel to you. Try to
forget it. You have put the investigation into my hands. Leave it
there and wash your own of it. You did not kill Harold Monkhouse.
Whoever did must pay the penalty if ever the crime should be brought
home to the perpetrator. And if it never can be, it were better that
you and all of us should let it sink into oblivion rather than allow
it to remain to poison the lives of innocent persons. Let us forget it
now. I see you were trying to.”

I had noticed that when he first entered the room, he cast a single,
swift glance at the table which, I was sure, had comprehended every
object on it. Then he had looked away and never again let his eyes
stray in that direction. But now, as he finished speaking, he glanced
once more at the table, and this time with undisguised interest.

“Yes,” I admitted. “I was trying to find in the memories of the past
an antidote for the present. These are the relics of that past. I
daresay you have read of them in the diary and probably have written
me down a mawkish sentimentalist.”

“I pray you, my friend, not to do me that injustice!” he exclaimed.
“Faithful friendship that even survives the grave, is not a thing that
any man can afford to despise. But for the disaster of untimely death,
your faithfulness and hers would have created for two persons the
perfect life. I assure you, Mayfield, that I have been deeply moved by
the story of your delightful friendship and your irreparable loss. But
don’t let us dwell too much on the sad aspects of the story. Show me
your relics. I see some very charming little plaques among them.”

He picked up one with reassuring daintiness of touch and examined it
through a reading-glass that I handed to him.

“It really is a most admirable little work,” said he. “Not in the
least amateurish. She had the makings of a first-class medallist; the
appreciation of the essential qualities of a miniature relief. And she
had a fine feeling for composition and spacing.”

Deeply gratified by his appreciation and a little surprised by his
evident knowledge of the medallist’s art, I presented the little
works, one after another, and we discussed their merits with the
keenest interest. Presently he asked:

“Has it never occurred to you, Mayfield, that these charming little
works ought to be finished?”

“Finished?” I repeated. “But, aren’t they finished?”

“Certainly not. They are only in the plaster. But a plaster cast is an
intermediate form, just a mere working model. It is due to the merits
of these plaques and medals that they should be put into permanent
material—silver or copper or bronze. I’ll tell you what, Mayfield,” he
continued, enthusiastically. “You shall let Polton make replicas of
some of them—he could do it with perfect safety to the originals. Then
we could hand the casts to an electrotyper or a founder—I should
favour the electrotype process for such small works—and have them
executed in whichever metal you preferred. Then you would be able to
see, for the first time, the real quality of the modelling.”

I caught eagerly at the idea, but yet I was a little nervous.

“You think it would be perfectly safe?” I asked.

“Absolutely safe. Polton would make gelatine moulds which couldn’t
possibly injure the originals.”

That decided me. I fell in with the suggestion enthusiastically, and
forthwith we began an anxious consultation as to the most suitable
pieces with which to make a beginning. We had selected half a dozen
casts when my glance fell on the wax mould. That was Stella’s
masterpiece and it certainly ought to be finished; but I was loath to
part with the mould for fear of an accident. Very dubiously, I handed
it to Thorndyke and asked:

“What do you think of this? Could it be cast without any risk of
breaking it?”

He laid the mould on the table before him so that the light fell
obliquely across it and looked down on it reflectively.

“So,” said he, “this is the wax mould. I was reading about it only
yesterday and admiring your resourcefulness and ingenuity. I must read
the entry again with the actual object before me.”

He opened the diary, which he had laid on the table, and when he had
found the entry, read it to himself in an undertone.

“Dropped in to have tea with Stella and found her bubbling with
excitement and triumph. She had just finished the portrait medal and
though her eyes were red and painful from the strain of the close
work, in spite of her new spectacles, she was quite happy and as proud
as a little peacock. And well she might be. I should like Lanterri to
see his unknown pupil’s work. We decided to make the mould of it at
once, but when I got out the plaster tin, I found it empty. Most
unfortunate, for the clay was beginning to dry and I didn’t dare to
damp it. But something had to be done to protect it. Suddenly I had a
brilliant idea. There was nearly a whole candle in Stella’s
candlestick, quite enough for a mould, and good, hard wax that
wouldn’t warp. I took off the reflector and lighted the candle, which
I took out of the candlestick and held almost upside down over the
clay medal and let the wax drip on to it. Soon the medal was covered
by a film of wax which grew thicker and thicker, until, by the time I
had used up practically the whole of the candle, there was a good,
solid crust of wax, quite strong enough to cast from. When I went
home, I took the slate with me with the wax mould sticking to it,
intending to cover it with a plaster shell for extra safety. But my
plaster tin was empty, too, so I put the slate away in a safe place
until I should get some fresh plaster to make the cast; which will not
happen until I get back from Chelmsford.

“Busy evening getting ready for to-morrow; hope I shall feel less
cheap then than I do now.”

As Thorndyke finished reading he looked up and remarked: “That was an
excellent plan of yours. I have seen Polton use the same method. But
how was it that you never made the cast?”

“I was afraid of damaging the mould. As you know, when I came back
from Ipswich, Stella was dead, and as the medal was her last work and
her best, I hardly dared to risk the chance of destroying it.”

“Still,” Thorndyke urged, “it was the medal that was her work. The
mould was your own; and the medal exists only potentially in the
mould. It will come into actual existence only when the cast is made.”

I saw the force of this, but I was still a little uneasy, and said so.

“There is no occasion,” said he. “The mould is amply strong enough to
cast from. It might possibly break in separating the cast, but that
would be of no consequence, as you would then have the cast, which
would be the medal, itself. And it could then be put into bronze or
silver.”

“Very well,” I said, “if you guarantee the safety of the operation, I
am satisfied. I should love to see it in silver; or perhaps it might
look even better in gold.”

Having disposed of the works, themselves, we fell to discussing the
question of suitable settings or frames; and this led us to the
subject of the portraits. Thorndyke glanced over the collection, and
picking up one, which happened to be my own favourite, looked at it
thoughtfully.

“It is a beautiful face,” said he, “and this seems to have been a
singularly happy portrait. In red chalk autotype, it would make a
charming little picture. Did you take it?”

“Yes; and as I have the negative I am inclined to adopt your
suggestion. I am surprised that I never thought of it myself, for red
chalk is exactly the right medium.”

“Then let Polton have the negative. He is quite an expert in autotype
work.”

I accepted the offer gladly and we then came back to the question of
framing. Thorndyke’s suggestion was that the portrait should be
treated as a medallion and enclosed in a frame to match that of the
medal. The idea appealed to me rather strongly, and presently a
further one occurred to me, though it was suggested indirectly by
Thorndyke, who had taken up the tress of Stella’s hair and was looking
at it admiringly as he drew it softly between his fingers.

“Human hair,” he remarked, “and particularly a woman’s hair, is always
a beautiful material, no matter what its colour may be; but this
red-gold variety is one of the most gorgeous of Nature’s productions.”

“Yes,” I agreed, “it is extremely decorative. Barbara had her tress
made up into a thin plait and worked into the frame of a miniature of
Stella. I liked the idea, but somehow the effect is not so very
pleasing. But it is an oblong frame.”

“I don’t think,” said Thorndyke, “that a plait was quite the best
form. A little cable would look better, especially for a medallion
portrait; indeed I think that if you had a plain square black frame
with a circular opening, a little golden cable, carried round
concentrically with the opening would have a rather fine effect.”

“So it would,” I exclaimed. “I think it would look charming. I had no
idea, Thorndyke, that you were a designer. Do you think Polton could
make the cable?”

“Polton,” he replied, impressively, “can do anything that can be done
with a single pair of human hands. Let him have the hair, and he will
make the cable and the frame, too; and he will see that the glass
cover is an airtight fit—for, of course, the cable would have to be
under the glass.”

To this also I agreed with a readiness that surprised myself. And yet
it was not surprising. Hitherto I had been accustomed secretly and in
solitude to pore over these pathetic little relics of happier days and
lock up my sorrows and my sense of bereavement in my own breast. Now,
for the first time, I had a confidant who shared the knowledge of my
shattered hopes and vanished happiness; and so whole heartedly, with
such delicate sympathy and perfect understanding had Thorndyke entered
into the story of my troubled life that I found in his companionship
not only a relief from my old self-repression but a sort of subdued
happiness. Almost cheerfully I fetched an empty cigar-box and a supply
of cotton wool and tissue paper and helped him tenderly and delicately
to pack my treasures for their first exodus from under my roof. And it
was with only a faint twinge of regret that I saw him, at length,
depart with the box under his arm.

“You needn’t be uneasy, Mayfield,” he said, pausing on the stairs to
look back. “Nothing will be injured; and as soon as the casting is
successfully carried through, I shall drop a note in your letter-box
to set your mind at rest. Good night.”

I watched him as he descended the stairs, and listened to his quick
foot-falls, fading away up the court. Then I went back to my room with
a faint sense of desolation to re-pack the depleted deed-box and
thereafter to betake myself to bed.



Chapter XV

A Pursuit and a Discovery

More than a week had passed since that eventful evening—how eventful I
did not then realize—when I had delivered my simple treasures into
Thorndyke’s hands. But I was not uneasy; for, within twenty-four
hours, I had found in my letter-box the promised note, assuring me
that the preliminary operations had been safely carried through and
that nothing had been damaged. Nor was I impatient. I realized that
Polton had other work than mine on hand and that there was a good deal
to do. Moreover, a little rush of business had kept me employed and
helped me to follow Thorndyke’s counsel and forget, as well as I
could, the shadow of mystery and peril that hung over my friends, and,
by implication, over me.

But on the evening of which I am now speaking I was free. I had
cleared off the last of the day’s work, and, after dining reposefully
at my club, found myself with an hour or two to spare before bed-time;
and it occurred to me to look in on Thorndyke to smoke a friendly pipe
and perchance get a glimpse of the works in progress.

I entered the Temple from the west, and, threading my way through the
familiar labyrinth, crossed Tanfield Court, and passing down the
narrow alley at its eastern side, came out into King’s Bench Walk. I
crossed the Walk at once and was sauntering down the pavement towards
Thorndyke’s house when I noticed a large, closed car drawn up at its
entry, and, standing on the pavement by the car, a tall man whom I
recognized by the lamp light as Mr. Superintendent Miller.

Now I did not much want to meet the superintendent, and in any case it
was pretty clear to me that my visit to Thorndyke was not very
opportune. The presence of Miller suggested business, and the size of
the car suggested other visitors. Accordingly I slowed down and was
about to turn back when my eye caught another phenomenon. In the entry
next to Thorndyke’s a man was standing, well back in the shadow, but
not so far that he could not get a view of the car; on which he was
quite obviously keeping a watchful eye. Indeed, he was so pre-occupied
with his observation of it that he had not noticed my approach, his
back being turned towards me.

Naturally, the watchful attitude and the object of his watchfulness
aroused my suspicions as to his identity. But a movement backward on
his part which brought him within range of the entry lamp, settled the
matter. He was Anthony Wallingford.

I turned and walked quietly back a few paces. What was this idiot
doing here within a few yards of Thorndyke’s threshold? Was he merely
spying fatuously and without purpose? Or was it possible that he might
be up to some kind of mischief? As I framed the question my steps
brought me opposite another entry. The Walk was in darkness save for
the few lamps and the place was practically deserted. After a moment’s
reflection, I stepped into the entry and decided thence to keep a
watch upon the watcher.

I had not long to wait. Hardly had I taken up my rather undignified
position when three men emerged from the house and walked slowly to
the car. By the light of the lamp above Thorndyke’s entry, I could see
them quite plainly and I recognized them all. One was Thorndyke,
himself, another was Dr. Jervis, Thorndyke’s colleague, now in the
employ of the Home Office, and the third was Dr. Barnwell, well-known
to me as the analyst and toxicologist to the Home Office. All three
carried substantial bags and Dr. Barnwell was encumbered with a large
case, like an out-size suit-case, suggestive of chemical apparatus.
While they were depositing themselves and their impedimenta in the
car, Superintendent Miller gave directions to the driver. He spoke in
clear, audible tones, but though (I have to confess) I listened
intently, I caught only the question: “Do you know the way?” The words
which preceded and followed it were just audible but not intelligible
to me. It appeared, however, that they were intelligible to
Wallingford, for, as soon as they were spoken and while the
superintendent still held the open door of the car, he stepped forth
from his lurking-place and walked boldly and rapidly across to the
narrow passage by which I had come.

Realizing instantly what his intention was, I came out of the entry
and started in pursuit. As I reached the entrance to the passage, my
ear caught the already faint sound of his receding footsteps; by which
I learned that he was running swiftly and as silently as he could.
Since I did not intend to lose him, I had no choice but to follow his
example, and I raced across Tanfield Court, past the Cloisters and
round by the church as if the Devil were after me instead of before.
Half-way up Inner Temple Lane he slowed down to a walk—very wisely,
for otherwise the night porter would certainly have stopped him—and
was duly let out into Fleet Street, whither I followed him at a short
interval.

When I stepped out of the gate I saw him some little distance away to
the west, giving directions to the driver of a taxi. I looked round
desperately, and, to my intense relief, perceived an apparently empty
taxi approaching from the east. I walked quickly towards it,
signalling as I went, and the driver at once drew in to the kerb and
stopped. I approached him, and, leaning forward, said in a low
voice—though there was no one within earshot:

“There is a taxi just in front. It will probably follow a big car
which is coming up Middle Temple Lane. I want you to keep that taxi in
sight, wherever it may go. Do you understand?”

The man broke into a cynical grin—the nearest approach to geniality of
which a taxi-driver is capable—and replied that he understood; and as,
at this moment, the nose of the car appeared coming through the arched
entrance gate of Middle Temple Lane, I sprang into the taxi and shut
the door. From the off-side window, but keeping well back out of
sight, I saw the car creep across Fleet Street, turn eastward and then
sweep round into Chancery Lane. Almost immediately, Wallingford’s taxi
moved off and followed; and then, after a short interval, my own
vehicle started, and, crossing directly to Chancery Lane, went ahead
in the wake of the others.

It was an absurd affair. Now that the pursuit was started and its
conduct delegated for the time to the driver, I leaned back in the
shadow and was disposed to grin a little sheepishly at my own
proceedings. I had embarked on them in obedience to a sudden impulse
without reflection—for which, indeed, there had been no time. But was
there anything to justify me in keeping this watch on Wallingford? I
debated the question at some length and finally decided that, although
he was probably only playing the fool, still it was proper that I
should see what he was really up to. Thorndyke was my friend and it
was only right that I should stand between him and any possible
danger. Well as he was able to take care of himself, he could not be
always on his guard. And I could not forget the infernal machine. Some
one at least had the will to do him an injury.

But what about the brown-hatted man? Why had he not joined in this
novel sport? Or had he? I put my head out of the window and looked
along the street in our rear, but there was no sign of any pursuing
taxi. The ridiculous procession was limited to three vehicles; which
was just as well, since we did not want a police cyclist bringing up
the rear.

From my own proceedings my thoughts turned to those of Thorndyke and
his companions, though they were no affair of mine, or of
Wallingford’s either, for that matter. Apparently the three men were
going somewhere to make a post mortem examination. The presence of Dr.
Barnwell suggested an analysis in addition; and the presence of Miller
hinted at a criminal case of some kind. But it was not my case or
Wallingford’s. For both of us the analyst had already done his worst.

While I reflected, I kept an eye on the passing landmarks, checking
our route and idly trying to forecast our destination. From Chancery
Lane we crossed Holborn and entered Gray’s Inn Road, at the bottom of
which we swept round by King’s Cross into Pancras Road. At the end of
this we turned up Great College Street, crossed Camden Road and
presently passed along the Kentish Town Road. So far I had noted our
progress with no more than a languid interest. It did not matter to me
whither we were going. But when, at the Bull and Gate, we swept round
into Highgate Road, my attention awoke; and when the taxi turned
sharply at the Duke of St. Albans and entered Swain’s Lane, I sat up
with a start. In a moment of sudden enlightenment, I realized what our
destination must be; and the realization came upon me with the effect
of a palpable blow. This lane, with its precipitous ascent at the
upper end, was no ordinary thoroughfare. It was little more than an
approach to the great cemetery whose crowded areas extended on either
side of it; its traffic was almost completely limited to the mournful
processions that crept up to the wide gates by the mortuary chapel.
Indeed, on the very last occasion when I had ridden up this lane, my
conveyance had been the mourning carriage which followed poor little
Stella to her last home.

Before I had recovered from the shock of this discovery sufficiently
to consider what it might mean, the taxi came to a sudden halt. I
stepped out, and, looking up the lane, made out the shadowy form of
Wallingford’s vehicle, already backing and manœuvring to turn round.

“Bloke in front has got out,” my driver announced in a hoarse whisper,
and as he spoke, I caught sight of Wallingford—or at least of a human
figure—lurking in the shadow of the trees by the railings on the
right-hand side of the road. I paid off my driver (who, thereupon,
backed on to the footway, turned and retired down the hill) and having
waited for the other taxi to pass down, began slowly to ascend the
lane, keeping in the shadow of the trees. Now that the two taxis were
gone, Wallingford and I had the lane to ourselves, excepting where, in
the distance ahead, the reflected light from the head-lamps of the car
made a dim halo and the shape of the gothic chapel loomed indistinctly
against the murky sky. I could see him quite plainly, and no doubt he
was aware of my presence; at any rate, I did not propose to attempt
any concealment, so far as he was concerned. His movements had ceased
to be of any interest to me. My entire concern was with the party
ahead and with the question at to what Thorndyke was doing at this
time of night in Highgate Cemetery.

The burial ground is divided, as I have said, into two parts, which
lie on either side of the lane; the old cemetery with its great gates
and the large mortuary chapel, on the left or west side and the newer
part on the right. To which of these two parts was Thorndyke bound?
That was the question that I had to settle.

I continued to advance up the lane, keeping in the shadow, though it
was a dark night and the precaution was hardly necessary. Presently I
overtook Wallingford and passed him without either concealment or
recognition on either side. I could now clearly make out the gable and
pinnacles of the chapel and saw the car turn in the wide sweep and
then extinguish its headlights. Presently, from the gate-house there
emerged a party of men of whom some carried lanterns, by the light of
which I could recognize Thorndyke and his three companions; and I
noted that they appeared to have left their cases either in the car or
elsewhere for they now carried nothing. They lingered for a minute or
two at the wicket by the great gates; then, accompanied by a man whom
I took to be the gate-keeper, they crossed the road to the gate of the
eastern cemetery and were at once followed by another party of men,
who trundled two wheel-barrows, loaded with some bulky objects the
nature of which I could not make out. I watched them with growing
anxiety and suspicion as they passed in at the gate; and when they had
all entered and moved away along the main path, I came forth from the
shadow and began to walk quickly up the lane.

The eastern cemetery adjoins Waterlow Park, from which it is separated
by a low wall surmounted by tall railings, and this was my objective.
The park was now, of course, closed for the night, locked up and
deserted. So much the better. Locks and bars were no hindrance to me.
I knew the neighbourhood of old. Every foot of the lane was familiar
to me, though the houses that had grown up at the lower end had
changed its aspect from that which I remembered when as a boy I had
rambled through its leafy shades. On I strode, past the great gates on
the left and the waiting car, within which I could see the driver
dozing, past the white gatehouse on the right, up the steep hill until
I came to the place where a tall oak fence encloses the park from the
lane. Here I halted and took off my overcoat, for the six-foot fence
is guarded at the top by a row of vicious hooks. Laying the folded
overcoat across the top of the fence, I sprang up, sat for a moment
astride and then dropped down into the enclosure.

I now stood in a sort of dry ditch between the fence and a steep bank,
covered with bushes which rose to the level of the park. I had just
taken down my overcoat and was putting it on before climbing the bank
when its place was taken by another overcoat cast over from without.
Then a pair of hands appeared, followed by the clatter of feet against
the fence and the next moment I saw Wallingford astride of the top and
looking down at me.

I still affected to be unaware of him, and, turning away, began to
scramble up the bank, at the summit of which I pushed my way through
the bushes, and, stepping over a three-foot fence, came out upon a
by-path overshadowed by trees. Pausing for a moment to get my bearings
and to mark out a route by which I could cross the park without coming
into the open, where I might be seen by some watchful keeper, I
started off towards a belt of trees just as Wallingford stepped over
the dwarf fence and came out upon the path behind me.

The position was becoming absurd, though I was too agitated to
appreciate its humour. I could not protest against his following me
seeing that I had come in the first place to spy upon him, and was
now, like himself, engaged in spying upon Thorndyke. However, he soon
solved the difficulty by quickening his pace and overtaking me, when
he asked in a quite matter-of-fact tone:

“What is Thorndyke up to, Mayfield?”

“That is what I want to find out,” I replied.

“He is not acting on your instructions, then?”

“No; and the probability is that what he is doing is no concern of
mine or of yours either. But I don’t know; and I have come here to
make sure. Keep in the shadow. We don’t want the keeper to see us
prowling about here.”

He stepped back into the shade and we pursued our way in silence; and
even then, troubled and agitated as I was, I noted that he asked me no
question as to what was in my mind. He was leaving the initiative
entirely to me.

When we had crossed the park in the shelter of the trees and descended
into the hollow by the little lake where we were out of sight of the
gate-house, I led the way towards the boundary between the park and
the cemetery. The two enclosures were separated, as I have said, by a
low wall surmounted by a range of high, massive railings; and the wall
and the cemetery beyond were partially concealed by an irregular hedge
of large bushes. Pushing through the bushes, I moved along the wall
until I came to the place which I intended to watch; and here I halted
in the shade of a tall mass of bushes, and resting my arms on the
broad coping of the wall, took up my post of observation with
Wallingford, silently attentive at my side.

The great burial ground was enveloped in darkness so profound that the
crowded headstones and monuments conveyed to the eye no more than a
confused glimmer of ghostly pallor that was barely distinguishable
from the general obscurity. One monument only could be separately
identified: a solitary stone cross that rose above a half-seen grave
some sixty yards from the wall. But already the mysterious procession
could be seen threading its way in and out by the intricate, winding
paths, the gleam of the lanterns lighting up now a marble figure and
now a staring head-stone or urn or broken column; and as it drew ever
nearer, the glare of the lanterns, the rumble of the barrow-wheels on
the hard paths and the spectral figures of the men grew more and more
distinct. And still Wallingford watched and spoke never a word.

At length, a turn of the path brought the procession into full view,
and as it approached I could make out a man,—evidently by his uniform,
the cemetery keeper,—leading, lantern in hand and showing the way.
Nearer and nearer the procession drew until at last, close by the
stone cross, the leader halted. Then, as Thorndyke and his
companions—now clearly visible—came up, he lifted his lantern and let
its light fall full on the cross. And even at this distance I could
read with ease—though it was unnecessary—the single name STELLA.

As that name—to me so sacred—flashed out of the darkness, Wallingford
gripped my arm. “Great God!” he exclaimed. “It is Stella Keene’s
grave! I came here once with Barbara to plant flowers on it.” He
paused, breathing hard and still clutching my arm. Then, in a hoarse
whisper, he demanded:

“What can that devil be going to do?”

There was little need to ask. Even as he spoke, the labourers began to
unload from the first barrow its lading of picks, shovels and coils of
rope. And when these were laid on the ground, the second barrow
yielded up its cargo; a set of rough canvas screens which the men
began to set up around the grave. And even as the screens were being
erected, another lantern slowly approaching along the path, revealed
two men carrying a long, bedstead-like object—a bier—which they at
length set down upon its stunted legs just outside the screens.

With set teeth I stared incredulously between the railings at these
awful preparations while Wallingford, breathing noisily, held fast to
my arm with a hand that I could feel shaking violently. The lanterns
inside the screens threw a weird, uncertain light on the canvas, and
monstrous, distorted shadows moved to and fro. Presently, amidst these
flitting, spectral shapes, appeared one like an enormous gnome, huge,
hideous and deformed, holding an up-raised pick. The shadowy implement
fell with an audible impact, followed by the ring of a shovel.

At the sight and the sound—so dreadfully conclusive—Wallingford sprang
up with a stifled cry.

“God Almighty! That devil is going to dig her up!”

He stood motionless and rigid for a few moments. Then, turning
suddenly, without another word, he burst through the bushes, and I
heard him racing madly across the park.

I had half a mind to follow him. I had seen enough. I now knew the
shocking truth. Why stay and let my soul be harrowed by the sight of
these ghouls. Every stroke of pick or shovel seemed to knock at my
heart. Why not go and leave them to their work of desecration? But I
could not go. I could not tear myself away. There was the empty bier.
Presently she would be lying on it. I could not go until I had seen
her borne away.

So I stayed there gazing between the railings, watching the elfin
shapes that flitted to and fro on the screen, listening to the thud of
pick and the ring and scrape of shovel and letting my confused
thoughts wander obscurely through a maze of half-realized pain and
anger. I try in vain to recall clearly what was my state of mind. Out
of the confusion and bewilderment little emerges but a dull
indignation and especially a feeling of surprised resentment against
Thorndyke.

The horrible business went on methodically. By degrees a shadowy mound
grew up at the bottom of the screen. And then other movements and
other sounds; a hollow, woody sound that seemed to bring my heart into
my mouth. At last, the screens were opened at the end and then the
coffin was borne out and laid on the bier. By the light of the
lanterns I could see it distinctly. I was even able to recognize it,
shabby and earth-stained as it now was. I saw Thorndyke help the
keeper to spread over it some kind of pall, and then two men stepped
between the handles of the bier, stooped and picked it up; and then
the grim procession re-formed and began slowly to move away.

I watched it until it had passed round a turn of the path and was
hidden from my view. Then I stood up, pushed my way through the bushes
and stole away across the park by the way I had come. In the ditch
inside the fence I stood for a few moments listening, but the silence
was as profound as the darkness. As quietly as I could I climbed over
the fence and dropped down into the lane. There seemed to be not a
soul moving anywhere near; nevertheless, when I had slipped on my
overcoat, instead of retracing my steps down the lane past the
entrance-gates of the cemetery, I turned to the right and toiled up
the steep hill to its termination in South Grove, where I bore away
westward and descending the long slope of West Hill, passed the Duke
of St. Albans and re-entered the Highgate Road.

It did not occur to me to look out for any conveyance. My mind was in
a whirl that seemed to communicate itself to my body and I walked on
and on like one in a dream.

The dreary miles of deserted streets were consumed unreckoned—though
still, without conscious purpose, I followed the direct road home as a
well-constructed automaton might have done. But I saw nothing. Nor,
for a time, could I be said to think coherently. My thoughts seethed
and eddied in such confusion that no product emerged. I was conscious
only of an indignant sense of shocked decency and a loathing of
Thorndyke and all his works.

Presently, however, I grew somewhat more reasonable and my thoughts
began to take more coherent shape. As a lawyer, I could not but
perceive that Thorndyke must have something definite in his mind. He
could not have done what I had seen him do without a formal authority
from the Home Secretary; and before any such authority would have been
given he would have been called upon to show cause why the exhumation
should be carried out. And such licenses are not lightly granted. Nor,
I had to admit, was Thorndyke likely to have made the application
without due consideration. He must have had reasons for this
outrageous proceeding which not only appeared sufficient to him but
which must have appeared sufficient to the Home Secretary.

All this became by degrees clear enough to me. But yet I had not a
moment’s doubt that he had made some monstrous mistake. Probably he
had been misled by something in my diary. That seemed to be the only
possible explanation. Presently he would discover his error—by means
which I shudderingly put aside. But when the error was discovered, the
scandal would remain. It is impossible to maintain secrecy in a case
like this. In twenty-four hours or less, all the world would know that
the body of Mrs. Monkhouse’s step-sister had been exhumed; and no
subsequent explanation would serve to destroy the effect of that
announcement. Wallingford’s dismal prophecy was about to be fulfilled.

Moreover, Thorndyke’s action amounted in effect to an open
accusation—not of Madeline or Wallingford but of Barbara, herself. And
this indignity she would suffer at my hands—at the hands of her oldest
friend! The thought was maddening. But for the outrageous lateness of
the hour, I would have gone to her at once to put her on her guard and
crave her pardon. It was the least that I could do. But it could not
be done to-night, for she would have been in bed hours ago and her
flat locked up for the night. However, I would go in the morning at
the earliest possible hour. I knew that Barbara was an early riser and
it would not be amiss if I arrived at the flat before the maid. She
must be warned at the earliest possible moment and by me, who was the
author of the mischief.

Thus, by the time that I reached my chambers I had decided clearly
what was to be done. At first, I was disposed to reject altogether the
idea of sleep. But presently, more reasonable thoughts prevailing, I
decided at least to lie down and sleep a little if I could. But first
I made a few indispensable preparations for the morning; filled the
kettle and placed it on the gas-ring, set out the materials for a
hasty breakfast, and cleaned my shoes. Then, when I had wound the
alarm clock and set it for five, I partially undressed and crept into
bed.

Barbara’s Message

The routine of modern life creates the habit of dividing the day into
a series of definite phases which we feel impelled to recognize even
in circumstances to which they have no real application. Normally, the
day is brought formally to an end by retirement to bed, a process
that—also normally—leads to a lapse into unconsciousness the emergence
from which marks the beginning of another day. So, in mere obedience
to the call of habit, I had gone to bed, though, in spite of bodily
fatigue, there had been no hint of any tendency to sleep. But I might
have saved myself the trouble. True, my tired limbs stretched
themselves out restfully and mere muscular fatigue slowly wore off;
but my brain continued, uselessly and chaotically to pursue its
activities only the more feverishly when the darkness and the silence
closed the avenues of impressions from without.

Hour after hour crept by with incredible slowness, marked at each
quarter by the gentle undertone of the Treasury clock, voicing its
announcement, as it seemed, in polite protest (surely there was never
a clock that hinted so delicately and unobtrusively at the passage of
the irrevocable minutes “that perish for us and are reckoned”). Other
sound there was none to break the weary silence of the night; but by
the soft, mellow chime I was kept informed of the birth of another day
and the progress of its infancy, which crawled so tardily in the wake
of my impatience.

At last, when half-past four had struck, I threw back the bed-clothes,
and, stepping out, switched on the light and put a match to the gas
under the kettle. I had no occasion to hurry, but rather sought to
make my preparations with studied deliberation; in spite of which I
had shaved, washed and dressed and was sitting down to my frugal
breakfast when the alarm clock startled me by blurting out with
preposterous urgency its unnecessary reminder.

It had just turned a quarter past five when I set forth to take my way
on foot towards Kensington. No conveyance was necessary, nor would it
have been acceptable; for though throughout the wearisome hours that I
had spent in bed my thoughts had never ceased to revolve around the
problem that Thorndyke had set, I still seemed to have the whole
matter to debate afresh.

What should I say to Barbara? How should I break to her the news that
my own appointed agent had made an undissembled accusation and was
holding over her an unconcealed menace? I knew well enough what her
attitude would be. She would hold me blameless and she would confront
the threat against her reputation—even against her liberty—calmly and
unafraid. I had no fear for her either of panic or recrimination. But
how could I excuse myself? What could I say in extenuation of
Thorndyke’s secret, hostile manœuvre?

The hands of the church clock were approaching half-past six when I
turned the corner and came in sight of the entrance to her flat. And
at the same moment I was made to realize the imminence and the
actuality of the danger which threatened her. In a narrow street
nearly opposite to the flat, a closed car was drawn up in such a
position that it could move out into the main road either to the right
or left without turning round; and a glance at the alert driver and a
watchful figure inside—both of whom looked at me attentively as I
passed—at once aroused my suspicions. And when, as I crossed to the
flat, I observed a tall man perambulating the pavement, those
suspicions were confirmed. For this was no brown-hatted neophyte. The
hard, athletic figure and the calm, observant face were unmistakable.
I had seen too many plain-clothes policemen to miss the professional
characteristics. And this man also took unobtrusive note of me as my
destination became apparent.

The church clock was chiming half-past six as I pressed the button of
the electric bell by Barbara’s front door. In the silence that still
wrapped the building, I could hear the bell ring noisily, though far
away, and I listened intently for some sounds of movement within. The
maid would not arrive for another half hour, but I knew that Barbara
was usually up at this hour. But I could hear no sign of any one
stirring in the flat. Then I rang again, and yet again; and as there
was still no sound from within, a vague uneasiness began to creep over
me. Could Barbara be away from home? That might be as well in some
respects. It might give time for the discovery of the error and save
some unpleasantness. On the other hand—but at this moment I made a
singular discovery myself. The latch-key was in the door! That was a
most remarkable circumstance. It was so very unlike the methodical,
self-possessed Barbara. But probably it had been left there by the
maid. At any rate, there it was; and as I had now rung four times
without result, I turned the key, pushed open the door and entered.

When I had closed the door behind me, I stood for some seconds in the
dark hall, listening. There was not a sound. I was astonished that the
noise of the bell had not aroused Barbara; indeed, I was surprised
that she was not already up and about. Still vaguely uneasy, I felt
for the light-switch, and when I had turned it on, stole along the
hall and peered into the sitting room. Of course there was no one in
it; nor was there any one in the kitchen, or in the spare bedroom.
Finally, I went to Barbara’s bedroom and knocked loudly, at the same
time calling her by name. But still there was no response or sound of
movement.

At last, after one or two more trials, I turned the handle and opening
the door a few inches, looked in. The room was nearly dark, but the
cold, wan light of the early morning was beginning to show on the
blind; and in that dim twilight I could just make out a figure lying
on the bed. With a sudden thrill of alarm, I stepped into the room and
switched on the light. And then I stood, rooted to the spot, as if I
had been turned into stone.

She was there, lying half-dressed upon the bed and as still as a
bronze effigy upon a tomb. From where I stood I could see that her
right hand, resting on the bed, lightly held a hypodermic syringe, and
that her left sleeve was rolled up nearly to the shoulder. And when,
approaching stealthily on tip-toe, I drew near, I saw upon the bare
arm a plainly visible puncture and close by it a little blister-like
swelling.

The first glance had made plain the dreadful truth. I had realized
instantly that she was dead. Yet still, instinctively, I put my
fingers to her wrist in the forlorn hope of detecting some lingering
trace of life; and then any possible doubt was instantly dispelled;
for the surface was stone-cold and the arm as rigid as that of a
marble statue. Not only was she dead; she had been lying here dead
while I, in my bed in the Temple, had lain listening to the chimes and
waiting for the hour when I could come to her.

For quite a long time I stood by the bed looking down on her in utter
stupefaction. So overwhelming was the catastrophe that for the moment
my faculties seemed to be paralysed, my power of thought suspended. In
a trance of amazement I gazed at her, and, with the idle irrelevancy
of a dreamer, noted how young, how beautiful she looked; how lissom
and graceful was the pose of the figure, how into the waxen face with
its drowsy eyes and parted lips, there had come a something soft and
youthful, almost girlish, that had not been there during life. Dimly
and dreamily I wondered what the difference could be.

Suddenly my glance fell on the syringe that still rested in her hand.
And with that my faculties awoke. She had killed herself! But why?
Even as I asked myself the question, the terrible, the incredible
answer stole into my mind only to be indignantly cast out. But yet—I
lifted my eyes from the calm, pallid face, so familiar and yet so
strange, and cast a scared glance round the room; and then I observed
for the first time a small table near the bed on which beside a flat
candle-stick containing the remains of a burnt-out candle, lay two
unstamped letters. Stepping over to the table, I read their
superscriptions. One was addressed to me, the other to Superintendent
Miller, C.I.D., and both were in Barbara’s handwriting.

With a shaking hand I snatched up the one addressed to me, tore open
the envelope and drew out the letter; and this is what I read:—

                                               “Thursday, 1 a.m.
  My dearest Rupert,

  This letter is to bid you farewell. When you receive it you will
  curse and revile me, but I shall not hear those curses. Now, as I
  write, you are my darling Rupert and I am your dear friend, Barbara.
  With what will be when I am gone, I have no concern. It would be
  futile to hope that any empty words of mine could win your
  forgiveness. I have no such thought and do not even ask for pardon.
  When you think of me in the future it will be with hatred and
  loathing. It cannot be otherwise. But I have no part in the future.
  In the present—which runs out with every word that I write—I love
  you, and you, at least, are fond of me. And so it will be to the
  end, which is now drawing near.

  But though this which I write to you in love will be read by you in
  hatred, yet I have a mind to let you know the whole truth. And that
  truth can be summed up in three words. I love you. I have always
  loved you, even when I was a little girl and you were a boy. My
  desire for you has been the constant, consuming passion of my life,
  and to possess you for my own has been the settled purpose from
  which I have never deviated but once—when I married Harold.

  As I grew up from girlhood to womanhood, my love grew from a girl’s
  to a woman’s passion and my resolution became more fixed. I meant to
  have you for my own. But there was Stella. I could see that you
  worshipped her, and I knew that I should never have you while she
  lived. I was fond of poor Stella. But she stood as an insuperable
  obstacle between you and me. And—I suppose I am not quite as other
  women. I am a woman of a single purpose. Stella stood in the way of
  that purpose. It was a terrible necessity. But it had to be.

  And after all, I seemed to have failed. When Stella was gone, you
  went away and I thought I had lost you for ever. For I could not
  follow you. I knew that you had understood me, at least partly, and
  that you had fled from me.

  Then I was in despair. It seemed that I had dismissed poor Stella to
  no purpose. For once, I lost courage, and, in my loneliness,
  committed myself to a marriage with poor Harold. It was a foolish
  lapse. I ought to have kept my courage and lived in hope, as I
  realized almost as soon as I had married him.

  But when you came back, I could have killed myself. For I could see
  that you were still the same old Rupert and my love flamed up more
  intensely than ever. And once more I resolved that you should be my
  own; and so you would have been in the end but for Dr. Thorndyke.
  That was the fatal error that I fell into; the error of
  under-valuing him. If I had only realized the subtlety of that man,
  I would have made a serious effort to deal with him. He should have
  had something very different from the frivolous make-believe that I
  sent him.

  Well, Rupert, my darling, I have played my hand and I have lost. But
  I have lost only by the merest mischance. As I sit here with the
  ready-filled syringe on the table at my side, I am as confident as
  ever that it was worth while. I regret nothing but the bad luck that
  defeated skilful play, and the fact that you, my dear one, have had
  to pay so large a proportion of my losings.

  I will say no more. You know everything now; and it has been a
  melancholy pleasure to me to have this little talk with you before
  making my exit.

                               Your loving friend,
                                                        Barbara.

  I have just slipped the key into the latch on the chance that you
  may come to me early. From what Tony said and what I know of you, I
  think it just possible. I hope you may. I like to think that we may
  meet, for the last time, alone.”

To say that this astounding letter left me numb and stupefied with
amazement would be to express but feebly its effect on me. The whole
episode presented itself to me as a frightful dream from which I
should presently awaken and come back to understandable and believable
realities. For I know not how long I stood, dazed by the shock, with
my eyes riveted on that calm, comely figure on the bed, trying to
grasp the incredible truth that this dead woman was Barbara, that she
had killed herself and that she had murdered Stella—murdered her
callously, deliberately and with considered intent.

Suddenly, the deathly silence of the flat was broken by the sound of
an opening, and then of a closing door. Then a strong masculine voice
was borne to my ear saying, in a not unkindly tone, “Now, my girl, you
had better run off to the kitchen and shut yourself in.”

On this I roused, and, walking across to the door, which was still
ajar, went out into the hall, where I confronted Superintendent Miller
and Barbara’s maid. Both stared at me in astonishment and the maid
uttered a little cry of alarm as she turned and hurried into the
kitchen. The superintendent looked at me steadily and with obvious
suspicion, and, after a moment or two, asked, gruffly, nodding at the
bedroom door, “Is Mrs. Monkhouse in there?”

“Mrs. Monkhouse is dead,” I answered.

“Dead!” he repeated, incredulously. Then, pushing past me, he strode
into the room, and as I followed, I could hear him cursing furiously
in a not very low undertone. For a few moments he stood looking down
on the corpse, gently touching the bare arm and apparently becoming
aware of its rigidity. Suddenly he turned, and, glaring fiercely at
me, demanded:

“What is the meaning of this, Mr. Mayfield?”

“The meaning?” I repeated, looking at him inquiringly.

“Yes. How came you to let her do this—that is, if she did it herself?”

“I found her dead when I arrived here,” I explained.

“And when did you arrive here?”

“About half an hour ago.”

He shook his head and rejoined in an ominously quiet tone:

“That won’t do, Sir. The maid has only just come and the dead woman
couldn’t have let you in.”

I explained that I had found the key in the outer door but he made no
pretence of accepting the explanation.

“That is well enough,” said he, “if you can prove that the key was in
the door. Otherwise it is a mere statement which may or may not be
true. The actual position is that I have found you alone in this flat
with the body of a woman who has died a violent death. You will have
to account satisfactorily for your presence here at this time in the
morning, and for your movements up to the time of your arrival here.”

The very equivocal, not to say perilous, position in which I suddenly
found myself served to steady my wits. I realized instantly how
profoundly suspicious the appearances really were and that if I could
not produce evidence of my recent arrival I should quite probably have
to meet the charge of being an accessory to the suicide. And an
accessory to suicide is an accessory to murder. It was a very serious
position.

“Have you seen your man yet?” I asked. “The men, I mean, who were on
observation duty outside.”

“I have seen them, but I haven’t spoken to them. They are waiting out
on the landing now. Why do you ask?”

“Because I think they saw me come in here.”

“Ah, well, we can see about that presently. Is that letter that you
have in your hand from Mrs. Monkhouse? Because, if it is, I shall want
to see it.”

“I don’t want to show it unless it is necessary; and I don’t think it
will be. There is a letter addressed to you which will probably tell
you all that you need know.”

He snatched up the letter, and, tearing it open, glanced through it
rapidly. Then, without comment, he handed it to me. It was quite short
and ran as follows:—

                                            “Thursday, 1.35 a.m.
  Mr. Superintendent Miller, C.I. D.

  This is to inform you that I alone am responsible for the death of
  my late husband, Harold Monkhouse, and also for that of the late
  Miss Stella Keene. I had no confidants or accomplices and no one was
  aware of what I had done.

  As my own death will occur in about ten minutes (from an injection
  of morphine which I shall administer to myself) this statement may
  be taken as my dying declaration.

  I may add that no one is aware of my intention to take my life.

                                         Yours very truly
                                             Barbara Monkhouse.”

“Well,” said Miller, as I returned the letter to him, “that supports
your statement, and if my men saw you enter the flat, that will
dispose of the matter so far as the suicide is concerned. But there is
another question. It is evident that she knew that a discovery had
been made. Now, who told her? Was it you, Mr. Mayfield?”

“No,” I replied, “it was not. I found her dead when I arrived, as I
have told you.”

“Do you know who did tell her?”

“I do not; and I am not disposed to make any guesses.”

“No, it’s no use guessing. Still, you know, Mr. Mayfield, you knew,
and you came here to tell her; and you know who knew besides yourself.
But there,” he added, as we moved out into the hall, “it is no use
going into that now. I’ve acted like a fool—too punctilious by half. I
oughtn’t to have let her slip through my fingers. I should have acted
at once on Dr. Thorndyke’s hint without waiting for confirmation.”

He was still speaking in an angry, reproachful tone; but suddenly his
manner changed. Looking at me critically but with something of kindly
sympathy, he said: “It has been a trying business for you, Mr.
Mayfield—the whole scandalous affair; and this must have given you a
frightful shock, though I expect you would rather have it as it is
than as it ought to have been. But you don’t look any the better for
it.”

He escorted me politely but definitely to the outer door, and when he
opened it I saw his two subordinates waiting on the landing; to both
of whom collectively Miller addressed the inquiry: “Did you see Mr.
Mayfield enter this flat?”

“Yes, Sir,” was the reply of one, confirmed by the other. “He went up
the stairs at exactly half-past six.”

Miller nodded, and wishing me “good morning,” beckoned to the two
officers; and as I turned to descend the stairs, I saw the three enter
and heard the door shut.

Once more in the outer world, walking the grey, half-lighted streets,
to which the yet unextinguished lamps seemed only to impart an added
chill, my confused thoughts took up the tangled threads at the point
at which the superintendent’s appearance had broken them off. But I
could not get my ideas arranged into any intelligible form. Each
aspect of the complex tragedy conflicted with all the others. The
pitiful figure that I had left lying on the bed made its appeal in
spite of the protest of reason; for the friendship of a lifetime
cannot easily be extinguished in a moment. I knew now that she was a
wretch, a monster; and when I reminded myself of what she had done, I
grudged the easy, painless death by which she had slipped away so
quietly from the wreckage that her incredible wickedness had created.
When I contrasted that death—a more gentle lapsing into oblivion—with
the long, cheerfully endured sufferings of brave, innocent little
Stella, I could have cursed the faithful friendship of Wallingford
which had let her escape from the payment to the uttermost farthing of
her hideous debt. And yet the face that haunted me—the calm, peaceful,
waxen face—was the face of Barbara, my friend, almost my sister, who
had been so much to me, who had loved me with that strange, tenacious,
terrible passion.

It was very confusing. And the same inconsistency pervaded my thoughts
of Thorndyke. Unreasonably, I found myself thinking of him with a
certain repulsion, almost of dislike, as the cause of this
catastrophe. Yet my reason told me that he had acted with the highest
motives of justice; that he had but sought retribution for Stella’s
sufferings and death and those of poor, harmless Harold Monkhouse;
that as a barrister, even as a citizen, he could do no less than
denounce the wrong-doer. But my feelings were too lacerated, my
emotions too excited to allow my reason to deal with the conflicting
elements of this tragedy.

In this confused state of mind, I walked on, hardly conscious of
direction, until I found myself at the entry of my chambers. I went in
and made a futile attempt to do some work. Then I paced the room for
an hour or more, alternately raging against Barbara and recalling the
lonely figure that I had seen in the twilight of that darkened room,
until my unrest drove me forth again to wander through the streets,
away into the squalid east, among the docks and the rookeries from
Whitechapel to Limehouse.

It was evening when, once more, I dragged myself up my stairs, and,
spent with fatigue and exhausted by lack of food—for during the whole
day I had taken but a few cups of tea, hastily snatched in the course
of my wanderings—re-entered my chamber. As I closed the door, I
noticed a letter in the box, and taking it out, listlessly opened the
envelope. It was from Thorndyke; a short note, but very cordially
worded, begging me “like a good fellow” to go round to have a talk
with him.

I flung the note down impatiently on the table, with an immediate
resurgence of my unreasonable sense of resentment. But in a few
minutes I experienced a sudden revulsion of feeling. A sense of
profound loneliness came upon me; a yearning for human companionship,
and especially for the companionship of Thorndyke, from whom I had no
secrets, and who knew the whole dreadful story even to its final
culmination.

Once more, foot-sore as I was, I descended my stairs and a couple of
minutes later was ascending the “pair” that led up to Thorndyke’s
chambers.



Chapter XVII

Thorndyke Retraces the Trail

Apparently Thorndyke had seen me from the window as I crossed the
Walk, for, when I reached the landing, I found him standing in the
open doorway of his chambers; and at the sight of him, whatever traces
of unreasonable resentment may have lingered in my mind, melted away
instantly. He grasped my hand with almost affectionate warmth, and
looking at me earnestly and with the most kindly solicitude, said:

“I am glad you have come, Mayfield. I couldn’t bear to think of you
alone in your chambers, haunted by this horrible tragedy.”

“You have heard, then—about Barbara, I mean?”

“Yes. Miller called and told me. Of course, he is righteously angry
that she has escaped, and I sympathize with him. But for us—for you
and me—it is a great deliverance. I was profoundly relieved when I
heard that she was gone; that the axe had fallen once for all.”

“Yes,” I admitted, “it was better than the frightful alternative of a
trial and what would have followed. But still, it was terrible to see
her, lying dead, and to know that it was my hand—the hand of her
oldest and dearest friend—that had struck the blow.”

“It was my hand, Mayfield, not yours that actually struck the blow.
But even if it had been yours instead of your agent’s, what could have
been more just and proper than that retribution should have come
through the hand of the friend and guardian of that poor murdered
girl?”

I assented with a shudder to the truth of what he had said, but still
my mind was too confused to allow me to see things in their true
perspective. Barbara, my friend, was still more real to me than
Barbara the murdress. He nodded sympathetically enough when I
explained this, but rejoined, firmly:

“You must try, my dear fellow, to see things as they really are.
Shocking as this tragedy is, it would have been immeasurably worse if
that terrible woman had not received timely warning. As it is, the
horrible affair has run its course swiftly and is at an end. And do
not forget that if the axe has fallen on the guilty its menace has
been lifted from the innocent. Madeline Norris and Anthony Wallingford
will sleep in peace to-night, free from the spectre of suspicion that
has haunted them ever since Harold Monkhouse died. As to the woman
whose body you found this morning, she was a monster. She could not
have been permitted to live. Her very existence was a menace to the
lives of all who came into contact with her.”

Again, I could not but assent to his stern indictment and his
impartial statement of the facts.

“Very well, Mayfield,” said he. “Then try to put it to yourself that,
for you, the worst has happened and is done with. Try to put it away
as a thing that now belongs to the past and is, in so far as it is
possible, to be forgotten.”

“As far as is possible,” I repeated. “Yes, of course, you are quite
right, Thorndyke. But forgetfulness is not a thing which we can
command at will.”

“Very true,” he replied. “But yet we can control to a large extent the
direction of our thoughts. We can find interests and occupations. And,
speaking of occupations, let me show you some of Polton’s
productions.”

He rose, and putting a small table by the side of my chair, placed on
it one or two small copper plaques and a silver medallion which he had
taken from a drawer. The medallion was the self-portrait of Stella
which had lain dormant in the wax mould through all the years which
had passed since her death, and as I took it in my hand and gazed at
the beloved face, I found it beautiful beyond my expectations.

“It is a most charming little work,” I said, holding it so that the
lamp light fell most favourably on the relic, “I am infinitely obliged
to you, Thorndyke.”

“Don’t thank me,” said he. “The whole credit is due to Polton. Not
that he wants any thanks, for the work has yielded him hours of
perfect happiness. But here he is with the products of another kind of
work.”

As he spoke, Polton entered with a tray and began in his neat,
noiseless way, to lay the table. I don’t know how much he knew, but
when I caught his eye and his smile of greeting, it seemed to me that
friendliness and kindly sympathy exuded from every line of his quaint,
crinkly face. I thanked him for his skilful treatment of my treasures
and then, observing that he was apparently laying the table for
supper, would have excused myself. But Thorndyke would hear of no
excuses.

“My dear fellow,” said he, “you are the very picture of physical
exhaustion. I suspect that you have had practically no food to-day. A
meal will help you to begin to get back to the normal. And, in any
case, you mustn’t disappoint Polton, who has been expecting you to
supper and has probably made a special effort to do credit to the
establishment.”

I could only repeat my acknowledgments of Polton’s goodness (noting
that he certainly must have made a special effort, to judge by the
results which began to make themselves evident) and, conquering my
repugnance to the idea of eating, take my place at the table.

It is perhaps somewhat humiliating to reflect that our emotional
states, which we are apt to consider on a lofty spiritual plane, are
controlled by matters so grossly material as the mere contents of our
stomachs. But such is the degrading truth, as I now realized. For no
sooner had I commenced a reluctant attack on the products of Polton’s
efforts and drunk a glass of Burgundy—delicately warmed by that
versatile artist to the exact optimum temperature—than my mental and
physical unrest began to subside and allow a reasonable, normal
outlook to develop, with a corresponding bodily state. In effect, I
made quite a good meal and found myself listening with lively interest
to Thorndyke’s account of the technical processes involved in
converting my little plaster plaques and the wax mould into their
final states in copper and silver.

Nevertheless, in the intervals of conversation the unforgettable
events of the morning and the preceding night tended to creep back
into my consciousness; and now a question which I had hitherto hardly
considered began to clamour for an answer. Towards the end of the
meal, I put it into words. Apropos of nothing in our previous
conversation, I asked:

“How did you know, Thorndyke?” and as he looked up inquiringly, I
added: “I mean, how were you able to make so confident a guess, for,
of course, you couldn’t actually know?”

“When do you mean?” he asked.

“I mean that when you applied for a Home Office authority you must
have had something to go on beyond a mere guess.”

“Certainly I had,” he replied. “It was not a guess at all. It was a
certainty. When I made the application I was able to say that I had
positive knowledge that Stella Keene had been poisoned with arsenic.
The examination of the poor child’s body was not for my information. I
would have avoided it if that had been possible. But it was not. As
soon as my declaration was made, the exhumation became inevitable. The
Crown could not have prosecuted on a charge of poisoning without an
examination of the victim’s body.”

“But, Thorndyke,” I expostulated, “how could you have been certain—I
mean certain in a legal sense? Surely it could have been no more than
a matter of inference.”

“It was not,” he replied. “It was a matter of demonstrated fact. I
could have taken the case into court and proved the fact of arsenical
poisoning. But, of course, the jury would have demanded evidence from
an examination of the body, and quite properly, too. Every possible
corroboration should be obtained in a criminal trial.”

“Certainly,” I agreed. “But still I find your statement
incomprehensible. You speak of demonstrated fact. But what means of
demonstration had you? There was my diary. I take it that that was the
principal source of your information; in fact I can’t think of any
other. But the diary could only have yielded documentary evidence,
which is quite a different thing from demonstrated fact.”

“Quite,” he agreed. “The diary contributed handsomely to the train of
circumstantial evidence that I had constructed. But the
demonstration—the final, positive proof—came from another source. A
very curious and unexpected source.”

“I suppose,” said I, “as the case is finished and dealt with, there
would be no harm in my asking how you arrived at your conclusion?”

“Not at all,” he replied. “The whole investigation is a rather long
story, but I will give you a summary of it if you like.”

“Why a summary?” I objected. “I would rather have it in extenso if it
will not weary you to relate it.”

“It will be more likely to weary you,” he replied. “But if you are
equal to a lengthy exposition, let us take to our easy chairs and
combine bodily comfort with forensic discourse.”

We drew up the two arm-chairs before the hearth, and when Polton had
made up the fire and placed between us a small table furnished with a
decanter and glasses, Thorndyke began his exposition.

“This case is in some respects one of the most curious and interesting
that I have met with in the whole of my experience of medico-legal
practice. At the first glance, as I told you at the time, the problem
that it presented seemed hopelessly beyond solution. All the evidence
appeared to be in the past and utterly irrecoverable. The vital
questions were concerned with events that had passed unrecorded and of
which there seemed to be no possibility that they could ever be
disinterred from the oblivion in which they were buried. Looking back
now on the body of evidence that has gradually accumulated, I am
astonished at the way in which the apparently forgotten past has given
up its secrets, one after another, until it has carried its revelation
from surmise to probability and from probability at last to
incontestible proof.

“The inquiry divides itself into certain definite stages, each of
which added new matter to that which had gone before. We begin,
naturally, with the inquest on Harold Monkhouse, and we may consider
this in three aspects: the ascertained condition of the body; the
evidence of the witnesses; and the state of affairs disclosed by the
proceedings viewed as a whole.

“First, as to the body: there appeared to be no doubt that Monkhouse
died from arsenical poisoning, but there was no clear evidence as to
how the poison had been administered. It was assumed that it had been
taken in food or in medicine—that it had been swallowed—and no
alternative method of administration was suggested or considered. But
on studying the medical witnesses’ evidence, and comparing it with the
descriptions of the patient’s symptoms, I was disposed to doubt
whether the poison had actually been taken by the mouth at all.”

“Why,” I exclaimed, “how else could it have been taken?”

“There are quite a number of different ways in which poisonous doses
of arsenic can be taken. Finely powdered arsenic is readily absorbed
by the skin. There have been several deaths from the use of ‘violet
powder’ contaminated with arsenic, and clothing containing powdered
arsenic would produce poisonous effects. Then there are certain
arsenical gases—notably arsine, or arseniureted hydrogen—which are
intensely poisonous and which possibly account for a part of the
symptoms in poisoning from arsenical wall-papers. There seemed to me
to be some suggestion of arsenical gas in Monkhouse’s case, but it was
obviously not pure gas-poisoning. The impression conveyed to me was
that of a mixed poisoning; that the arsenic had been partly inhaled
and partly applied to the skin, but very little, if any, taken by the
mouth.”

“You are not forgetting that arsenic was actually found in the
stomach?”

“No. But the quantity was very minute; and a minute quantity is of no
significance. One of the many odd and misleading facts about arsenic
poisoning is that, in whatever way the drug is taken, a small quantity
is always found in the stomach and there are always some signs of
gastric irritation. The explanation seems to be that arsenic which has
got into the blood in any way—through the skin, the lungs or
otherwise—tends to be eliminated in part through the stomach. At any
rate, the fact is that the presence of minute quantities of arsenic in
the stomach affords no evidence that the poison was swallowed.”

“But,” I objected, “what of the Fowler’s Solution which was found in
the medicine?”

“Exactly,” said he. “That was the discrepancy that attracted my
attention. The assumption was that deceased had taken in his medicine
a quantity of Fowler’s Solution representing about a grain and a half
of arsenious acid. If that had been so we should have expected to find
a very appreciable quantity in the stomach: much more than was
actually found. The condition of the body did not agree with the dose
that was assumed to have been taken; and when one came to examine the
evidence of the various witnesses there was further room for doubt.
Two of them had noticed the medicine at the time when the Fowler’s
Solution had not been added; but no witness had noticed it after the
alleged change and before the death of deceased. The presence of the
Fowler’s Solution was not observed until several days after his death.
Taking all the facts together, there was a distinct suggestion that
the solution had been added to the medicine at some time after
Monkhouse’s death. But this suggestion tended to confirm my suspicion
that the poison had not been swallowed. For the discovery of the
Fowler’s Solution in the medicine would tend to divert inquiry—and
did, in fact, divert it—from any other method of administering the
poison.

“To finish with the depositions: not only was there a complete lack of
evidence even suggesting any one person as the probable delinquent;
there was not the faintest suggestion of any motive that one could
consider seriously. The paltry pecuniary motive applied to all the
parties and could not be entertained in respect of any of them. The
only person who could have had a motive was Barbara. She was a young,
attractive woman, married to an elderly, unattractive husband. If she
had been attached to another man, she would have had the strongest and
commonest of all motives. But there was nothing in the depositions to
hint at any other man; and since she was absent from home when the
poisoning occurred, she appeared to be outside the area of possible
suspicion.

“And now to look at the evidence as a whole: you remember Miller’s
comment. There was something queer about the case; something very
oddly elusive. At the first glance it seemed to bristle with
suspicious facts. But when those facts were scrutinized they meant
nothing. There were plenty of clues but they led nowhere. There was
Madeline Norris who prepared the victim’s food—an obvious suspect. But
then it appeared that the poison was in the medicine, not in the food.
There was Wallingford who actually had poison in his possession. But
it was the wrong poison. There was the bottle that had undoubtedly
contained arsenic. But it was nobody’s bottle. There was the bottle
that smelled of lavender and had red stains in it and was found in
Miss Norris’s possession; but it contained no arsenic. And so on.

“Now all this was very strange. The strongest suspicion was thrown on
a number of people collectively. But it failed every time to connect
itself with any one individually. I don’t know precisely what Miller
thought of it, but to me it conveyed the strong impression of a
scheme—of something arranged, and arranged with extraordinary skill
and ingenuity. I had the feeling that, behind all these confusing and
inconsistent appearances, was a something quite different, with which
they had no real connection; that all these apparent clues were a sort
of smoke-screen thrown up to conceal the actual mechanism of the
murder.

“What could the mechanism of the murder have been? That was what I
asked myself. And by whom could the arrangements have been made and
carried out? Here the question of motive became paramount. What motive
could be imagined? And who could have been affected by it? That seemed
to be the essential part of the problem, and the only one that offered
the possibility of investigation.

“Now, as I have said, the most obvious motive in cases of this kind is
that of getting rid of a husband or wife to make room for another. And
ignoring moral considerations, it is a perfectly rational motive; for
the murder of the unwanted spouse is the only possible means of
obtaining the desired release. The question was, could such a motive
have existed in the present case; and the answer was that, on
inspection, it appeared to be a possible motive, although there was no
evidence that it actually existed. But, assuming its possibility for
the sake of argument, who could have been affected by it? At once, one
saw that Madeline Norris was excluded. The death of Harold Monkhouse
did not affect her, in this respect, at all. There remained only
Barbara and Wallingford. To take the latter first: He was a young man,
and the wife was a young, attractive woman; he had lived in the same
house with her, appeared to be her social equal and was apparently on
terms of pleasant intimacy with her. If he had any warmer feelings
towards her, her husband’s existence formed an insuperable obstacle to
the realization of his wishes. There was no evidence that he had any
such feelings, but the possibility had to be borne in mind. And there
were the further facts that he evidently had some means of obtaining
poisons and that he had ample opportunities for administering them to
the deceased. All things considered, Wallingford appeared, prima
facie, to be the most likely person to have committed the murder.

“Now to take the case of Barbara. In the first place, there was the
possibility that she might have had some feeling towards Wallingford,
in which case she would probably have been acting in collusion with
him and her absence from home on each occasion when the poisoning took
place would have been part of the arrangement. But, excluding
Wallingford, and supposing her to be concerned with some other man,
did her absence from home absolutely exclude the possibility of her
being the poisoner? There were suggestions of skilful and ingenious
arrangements to create false appearances. Was it possible that those
arrangements included some method by which the poison could be
administered during her absence without the connivance or knowledge of
any other person?

“I pondered this question carefully by the light of all the details
disclosed at the inquest; and the conclusion that I reached was that,
given a certain amount of knowledge, skill and executive ability, the
thing was possible. But as soon as I had admitted the possibility, I
was impressed by the way in which the suggestion fitted in with the
known facts and served to explain them. For all the arranged
appearances pointed to the use of Fowler’s Solution, administered by
the mouth. But this could not possibly have been the method if the
poisoner were a hundred miles away. And as I have said, I was strongly
inclined to infer, from the patient’s symptoms and the condition of
the body, that the poison had not been administered by the mouth.

“But all this, as you will realize, was purely hypothetical. None of
the assumptions was supported by a particle of positive evidence. They
merely represented possibilities which I proposed to bear in mind in
the interpretation of any new evidence that might come into view.

“This brings us to the end of the first stage; the conclusions arrived
at by a careful study of the depositions. But following hard on the
inquest was your visit to me when you gave me the particulars of your
past life and your relations with Barbara and Monkhouse. Now your
little autobiographical sketch was extremely enlightening, and, as it
has turned out, of vital importance. In the first place, it made clear
to me that your relations with Barbara were much more intimate than I
had supposed. You were not merely friends of long standing; you were
virtually in the relation of brother and sister. But with this very
important difference: that you were not brother and sister. An adopted
brother is a possible husband; an adopted sister is a possible wife.
And when I considered your departure to Canada with the intention of
remaining there for life, and your unexpected return, I found that the
bare possibility that Barbara might wish to be released from her
marriage had acquired a certain measure of probability.

“But further; your narrative brought into view another person who had
died. And the death of that person presented a certain analogy with
the death of Monkhouse. For if Barbara had wished to be your wife,
both these persons stood immovably in the way of her wishes. Of course
there was no evidence that she had any such wish, and the death of
Stella was alleged to have been due to natural causes. Nevertheless,
the faint, hypothetical suggestions offered by these new facts were
strikingly similar to those offered by the previous facts.

“The next stage opened when I read your diary, especially the volume
written during the last year of Stella’s life. But now one came out of
the region of mere speculative hypothesis into that of very definite
suspicion. I had not read very far when, from your chance references
to the symptoms of Stella’s illness, I came to the decided conclusion
that, possibly mingled with the symptoms of real disease, were those
of more or less chronic arsenical poisoning. And what was even more
impressive, those symptoms seemed to be closely comparable with
Monkhouse’s symptoms, particularly in the suggestion of a mixed
poisoning partly due to minute doses of arsine. I need not go into
details, but you will remember that you make occasional references to
slight attacks of jaundice (which is very characteristic of arsine
poisoning) and to ‘eye-strain’ which the spectacles failed to relieve.
But redness, smarting and watering of the eyes is an almost constant
symptom of chronic arsenic poisoning. And there were various other
symptoms of a decidedly suspicious character to which you refer and
which I need not go into now.

“Then a careful study of the diary brought into view another very
impressive fact. There were considerable fluctuations in Stella’s
condition. Sometimes she appeared to be so far improving as to lead
you to some hopes of her actual recovery. Then there would be a rather
sudden change for the worse and she would lose more than she had
gained. Now, at this time Barbara had already become connected with
the political movement which periodically called her away from home
for periods varying from one to four weeks; and when I drew up a table
of the dates of her departures and returns, I found that the periods
included between them—that is the periods during which she was absent
from home—coincided most singularly with Stella’s relapses. The
coincidence was so complete that, when I had set the data out in a
pair of diagrams in the form of graphs, the resemblance of the two
diagrams was most striking. I will show you the diagrams presently.

“But there was something else that I was on the lookout for in the
diary, but it was only quite near the end that I found it. Quite
early, I learned that Stella was accustomed to read and work at night
by the light of a candle. But I could not discover what sort of candle
she used; whether it was an ordinary household candle or one of some
special kind. At last I came on the entry in which you describe the
making of the wax mould; and then I had the information that I had
been looking for. In that entry you mention that you began by lifting
the reflector off the candle, by which I learned that the receptacle
used was not an ordinary candlestick. Then you remark that the candle
was of ‘good hard wax’; by which I learned that it was not an ordinary
household candle—these being usually composed of a rather soft
paraffin wax. Apparently, it was a stearine candle such as is made for
use in candle-lamps.”

“But,” I expostulated, “how could it possibly matter what sort of
candle she used? The point seems to be quite irrelevant.”

“The point,” he replied, “was not only relevant; it was of crucial
importance. But I had better explain. When I was considering the
circumstances surrounding the poisoning of Monkhouse, I decided that
the probabilities pointed to Barbara as the poisoner. But she was a
hundred miles away when the poisoning occurred; hence the question
that I asked myself was this: Was there any method that was possible
and practicable in the existing circumstances by which Barbara could
have arranged that the poisoning could be effected during her absence?
And the answer was that there was such a method, but only one. The
food and the medicine were prepared and administered by those who were
on the spot. But the candles were supplied by Barbara and by her put
into the bedside candle-box before she went away. And they would
operate during her absence.”

“But,” I exclaimed, “do I understand you to suggest that it is
possible to administer poison by means of a candle?”

“Certainly,” he replied. “It is quite possible and quite practicable.
If a candle is charged with finely powdered arsenious acid—‘white
arsenic’—when that candle is burnt, the arsenious acid will be partly
vaporized and partly converted into arsine, or arseniureted hydrogen.
Most of the arsine will be burnt in the flame and reconverted into
arsenious acid, which will float in the air, as it condenses, in the
form of an almost invisible white cloud. The actual result will be
that the air in the neighbourhood of the candle will contain small
traces of arsine—which is an intensely poisonous gas—and considerable
quantities of arsenious acid, floating about in the form of infinitely
minute crystals. This impalpable dust will be breathed into the lungs
of any person near the candle and will settle on the skin, from which
it will be readily absorbed into the blood and produce all the
poisonous effects of arsenic.

“Now, in the case of Harold Monkhouse, not only was there a special
kind of candle, supplied by the suspected person, but, as I have told
you, the symptoms during life and the appearances of the dead body,
all seemed to me to point to some method of poisoning through the
lungs and skin rather than by way of the stomach, and also suggested a
mixed poisoning in which arsine played some part. So that the candle
was not only a possible medium of the poisoning; it was by far the
most probable.

“Hence, when I came to consider Stella’s illness and noted the strong
suggestion of arsenic poisoning; and when I noted the parallelism of
her illness with that of Monkhouse; I naturally kept a watchful eye
for a possible parallelism in the method of administering the poison.
And not only did I find that parallelism; but in that very entry, I
found strong confirmation of my suspicion that the candle was
poisoned. You will remember that you mention the circumstance that on
the night following the making of the wax mould you were quite
seriously unwell. Apparently you were suffering from a slight attack
of acute arsenical poisoning, due to your having inhaled some of the
fumes from the burning candle.”

“Yes, I remember that,” said I. “But what is puzzling me is how the
candles could have been obtained. Surely it is not possible to buy
arsenical candles?”

“No,” he replied, “it is not. But it is possible to buy a
candle-mould, with which it is quite easy to make them. Remember that,
not so very long ago, most country people used to make their own
candles, and the hinged moulds that they used are still by no means
rare. You will find specimens in most local museums and in curio shops
in country towns and you can often pick them up in farm-house sales.
And if you have a candle-mould, the making of arsenical candles is
quite a simple affair. Barbara, as we know, used to buy a particular
German brand of stearine candles. All that she had to do was to melt
the candles, put the separated wicks into the mould, stir some
finely-powdered white arsenic into the melted wax and pour it into the
mould. When the wax was cool, the mould would be opened and the
candles taken out—these hinged moulds usually made about six candles
at a time. Then it would be necessary to scrape off the seam left by
the mould and smooth the candles to make them look like those sold in
the shops.”

“It was a most diabolically ingenious scheme,” said I.

“It was,” he agreed. “The whole villainous plan was very completely
conceived and most efficiently carried out. But to return to our
argument. The discovery that Stella had used a special form of candle
left me in very little doubt that Barbara was the poisoner and that
poisoned candles had been the medium used in both crimes. For we were
now out of the region of mere hypothesis. We were dealing with genuine
circumstantial evidence. But that evidence was still much too largely
inferential to serve as the material for a prosecution. We still
needed some facts of a definite and tangible kind; and as soon as you
came back from your travels on the South-Eastern Circuit, fresh facts
began to accumulate. Passing over the proceedings of Wallingford and
his follower and the infernal machine—all of which were encouraging,
as offering corroboration, but of no immediate assistance—the first
really important accretion of evidence occurred in connection with our
visit to the empty house in Hilborough Square.”

“Ha!” I exclaimed. “Then you did find something significant, in spite
of your pessimistic tone at the time? I may say, Thorndyke, that I had
a feeling that you went to that house with the definite expectation of
finding some specific thing. Was I wrong?”

“No. You were quite right. I went there with the expectation of
finding one thing and a faint hope of finding another; and both the
expectation and the hope were justified by the event. My main purpose
in that expedition was to obtain samples of the wall-paper from
Monkhouse’s room, but I thought it just possible that the soot from
the bedroom chimneys might yield some information. And it did.

“To begin with the wall-paper: the condition of the room made it easy
to secure specimens. I tore off about a dozen pieces and wrote a
number on each, to correspond with numbers that I marked on a rough
sketch-plan of the room which I drew first. My expectation was that
if—as I believed—arsenical candles had been burnt in that room,
arsenic would have been deposited on all the walls, but in varying
amounts, proportionate to the distance of the wall from the candle.
The loose piece of paper on the wall by the bed was, of course, the
real touchstone of the case, for if there were no arsenic in it, the
theory of the arsenical candle would hardly be tenable. I therefore
took the extra precaution of writing a full description of its
position on the back of the piece and deposited it for greater safety
in my letter-case.

“As soon as I reached home that day I spread out the torn fragment on
the wide stage of a culture microscope and examined its outer surface
with a strong top light. And the very first glance settled the
question. The whole surface was spangled over with minute crystals,
many of them hardly a ten-thousandth of an inch in diameter, sparkling
in the strong light like diamonds and perfectly unmistakable; the
characteristic octahedral crystals of arsenious acid.

“But distinctive as they were, I took nothing for granted. Snipping
off a good-sized piece of the paper, I submitted it to the
Marsh-Berzelius test and got a very pronounced ‘arsenical mirror,’
which put the matter beyond any possible doubt or question. I may add
that I tested all the other pieces and got an arsenic reaction from
them all, varying, roughly, according to their distance from the table
on which the candle stood.

“Thus the existence of the arsenical candle was no longer a matter of
hypothesis or even of mere probability; it was virtually a
demonstrated fact. The next question was, who put the arsenic into the
candle? All the evidence, such as it was, pointed to Barbara. But
there was not enough of it. No single fact connected her quite
definitely with the candles, and it had to be admitted that they had
passed through other hands than hers and that the candle-box was
accessible to several people, especially during her absence. Clear
evidence, then, was required to associate her—or some one else—with
those poisoned candles, and I had just a faint hope that such evidence
might be forthcoming. This was how I reasoned:

“Here was a case of poisoning in which the poison was
self-administered and the actual poisoner was absent. Consequently it
was impossible to give a calculated dose on a given occasion, nor was
it possible to estimate in advance the amount that would be necessary
to produce the desired result. Since the poison was to be left within
reach of the victim, to be taken from time to time, it would be
necessary to leave a quantity considerably in excess of the amount
actually required to produce death on any one occasion. It is probable
that all the candles in the box were poisoned. In any case, most of
them must have been; and as the box was filled to last for the whole
intended time of Barbara’s absence, there would be a remainder of
poisoned candles in the box when Monkhouse died. But the incident of
the ‘faked’ medicine showed that the poisoner was fully alive to the
possibility of an examination of the room. It was not likely that so
cautious a criminal would leave such damning evidence as the arsenical
candles in full view. For if, by chance, one of them had been lighted
and the bearer had developed symptoms of poisoning, the murder would
almost certainly have been out. In any case, we could assume that the
poisoner would remove them and destroy them after putting ordinary
candles in their place.

“But a candle is not a very easy thing to destroy. You can’t throw it
down a sink, or smash it up and cast it into the rubbish-bin. It must
be burnt; and owing to its inflammability, it must be burnt carefully
and rather slowly; and if it contains a big charge of arsenic, the
operator must take considerable precautions. And finally, these
particular candles had to be burnt secretly.

“Having regard to these considerations, I decided that the only safe
and practicable way to get rid of them was to burn them in a fireplace
with the window wide open. This would have to be done at night when
all the household was asleep, so as to be safe from interruption and
discovery; and a screen would have to be put before the fireplace to
prevent the glare from being visible through the open window. If there
were a fire in the grate, so much the better. The candles could be cut
up into small pieces and thrown into the fire one at a time.

“Of course the whole matter was speculative. There might have been no
surplus candles, or if there were, they might have been taken out of
the house and disposed of in some other way. But one could only act on
the obvious probabilities and examine the chimneys, remembering that
whereas a negative result would prove nothing for or against any
particular person, a positive result would furnish very weighty
evidence. Accordingly I collected samples of soot from the various
bedroom chimneys and from that of Barbara’s boudoir, labelling each of
them with the aid of the cards which you had left in the respective
rooms.

“The results were, I think, quite conclusive. When I submitted the
samples to analysis I found them all practically free from
arsenic—disregarding the minute traces that one expects to find in
ordinary soot—with one exception. The soot from Barbara’s bedroom
chimney yielded, not mere traces, but an easily measurable
quantity—much too large to have been attributable to the coal burnt in
the grate.

“Thus, you see, so far as the murder of Monkhouse was concerned, there
was a fairly conclusive case against Barbara. It left not a shadow of
doubt in my mind that she was the guilty person. But you will also see
that it was not a satisfactory case to take into court. The whole of
the evidence was scientific and might have appeared rather
unconvincing to the ordinary juryman, though it would have been
convincing enough to the judge. I debated with myself whether I should
communicate my discoveries to the police and leave them to decide for
or against a prosecution, or whether I should keep silence and seek
for further evidence. And finally I decided, for the present, to keep
my own counsel. You will understand why.”

“Yes,” said I. “You suspected that Stella, too, had been poisoned.”

“Exactly. I had very little doubt of it. And you notice that in this
case there was available evidence of a kind that would be quite
convincing to a jury—evidence obtainable from an examination of the
victim’s body. But here again I was disposed to adopt a waiting policy
for three reasons. First, I should have liked to avoid the exhumation
if possible. Second, if the exhumation were unavoidable, I was
unwilling to apply for it until I was certain that arsenic would be
found in the body; and third, although the proof that Stella had been
poisoned would have strengthened the case enormously against Barbara,
it would yet have added nothing to the evidence that a poisoned candle
had been used.

“But the proof of the poisoned candle was the kernel of the case
against Barbara. If I could prove that Stella had been poisoned by
means of a candle, that would render the evidence absolutely
irresistible. This I was not at present able to do. But I had some
slight hopes that the deficiency might be made up; that some new facts
might come into view if I waited. And, as there was nothing that
called for immediate action, I decided to wait, and in due course, the
deficiency was made up and the new facts did come into view.”

As he paused, I picked up Stella’s medallion and looked at it with a
new and sombre interest. Holding it up before him, I said:

“I am assuming, Thorndyke, that the new facts were in some way
connected with this. Am I right?”

“Yes,” he replied, “you are entirely right. The connection between
that charming little work and the evidence that sent that monster of
wickedness to her death is one of the strangest and most impressive
circumstances that has become known to me in the whole of my
experience. It is no exaggeration to say that when you and Stella were
working on that medallion, you were forging the last link in the chain
of evidence that could have dragged the murdress to the gallows.”

He paused, and, having replenished my glass, took the medallion in his
hand and looked at it thoughtfully. Then he knocked out and refilled
his pipe and I waited expectantly for the completion of this singular
story.



Chapter XVIII

The Final Proof

“We now,” Thorndyke resumed, “enter the final stage of the inquiry.
Hitherto we have dealt with purely scientific evidence which would
have had to be communicated to the jury and which they would have had
to take on trust with no convincing help from their own eyes. We had
evidence, conclusive to ourselves, that Monkhouse had been murdered by
means of a poisoned candle. But we could not produce the candle or any
part of it. We had nothing visible or tangible to show to the jury to
give them the feeling of confidence and firm conviction which they
rightly demand when they have to decide an issue involving the life or
death of the accused. It was this something that could be seen and
handled that I sought, and sought in vain until that momentous evening
when I called at your chambers to return your diary.

“I remember that as I entered the room and cast my eyes over the
things that were spread out on the table, I received quite a shock.
For the first glance showed me that, amongst those things were two
objects that exactly fulfilled the conditions of the final test. There
was the wax mould—a part, and the greater part, of one of the
suspected candles; and there was the tress of hair—a portion of the
body of the person suspected to have been poisoned. With these two
objects it was possible to determine with absolute certainty whether
that person had or had not been poisoned with arsenic, and if she had,
whether the candle had or had not been the medium by which the poison
was administered.”

“But,” I said, “you knew from the diary of the existence of the wax
mould.”

“I knew that it _had_ existed. But I naturally supposed that the cast
had been taken and the mould destroyed years ago, though I had
intended to ask you about it. However, here it was, miraculously
preserved, against all probabilities, still awaiting completion. Of
course, I recognized it instantly, and began to cast about in my mind
for some means of making the necessary examination without disclosing
my suspicions. For you will realize that I was unwilling to say
anything to you about Stella’s death until the question was settled
one way or the other. If the examination had shown no arsenic either
in the candle or in the hair, it would not have been necessary to say
anything to you at all.

“But while I was debating the matter, the problem solved itself. As
soon as I came to look at Stella’s unfinished works, I saw that they
cried aloud to be completed and that Polton was the proper person to
carry out the work. I made the suggestion, which I should have made in
any case, and when you adopted it, I decided to say nothing but to
apply the tests when the opportunity offered.”

“I am glad,” said I, “to hear you say that you would have made the
suggestion in any case. It looked at first like a rather cold-blooded
pretext to get possession of the things. But you were speaking of the
hair. Can you depend on finding recognizable traces of arsenic in the
hair of a person who has been poisoned?”

“Certainly, you can,” he replied. “The position is this: When arsenic
is taken it becomes diffused throughout the whole body, including the
blood, the bones and the skin. But as soon as a dose of arsenic is
taken, the poison begins to be eliminated from the body, and, if no
further dose is taken, the whole of the poison is thrown off in a
comparatively short time until none remains in the tissues—with one
exception. That exception is the epidermis, or outer skin, with its
appendages—the finger and toe nails and the hair. These structures
differ from all others in that, instead of growing interstitially and
being alive throughout, they grow at a certain growing-point and then
become practically dead structures. Thus a hair grows at the
growing-point where the bulb joins the true skin. Each day a new piece
of hair is produced at the living root, but when once it has come into
being it grows no more, but is simply pushed up from below by the next
portion. Thenceforward it undergoes no change, excepting that it
gradually moves upwards as new portions are added at the root. It is
virtually a dead, unchanging structure.

“Now suppose a person to take a considerable dose of arsenic. That
arsenic becomes diffused throughout all the living tissues and is for
a time deposited in them. The growing point of the hair is a living
tissue and of course the arsenic becomes deposited in it. Then the
process of elimination begins and the arsenic is gradually removed
from the living tissues. But in twenty-four hours, what was the
growing-point of the hair has been pushed up about the fiftieth of an
inch and is no longer a growing structure. It is losing its vitality.
And as it ceases to be a living tissue it ceases to be affected by the
process of elimination. Hence the arsenic which was deposited in it
when it was a living tissue is never removed. It remains as a
permanent constituent of that part of the hair, slowly moving up as
the hair grows from below, until at last it is snipped off by the
barber; or, if the owner is a long-haired woman, it continues to creep
along until the hair is full-grown and drops out.”

“Then the arsenic remains always in the same spot?”

“Yes. It is a local deposit at a particular point in the hair. And
this, Mayfield, is a most important fact, as you will see presently.
For observe what follows. Hair grows at a uniform rate—roughly, a
fiftieth of an inch in twenty-four hours. It is consequently possible,
by measurement, to fix nearly exactly, the age of any given point on a
hair. Thus if we have a complete hair and we find at any point in it a
deposit of arsenic, by measuring from that point to the root we can
fix, within quite narrow limits, the date on which that dose of
arsenic was taken.”

“But is it possible to do this?” I asked.

“Not in the case of a single hair,” he replied. “But in the case of a
tress, in which all the hairs are of the same age, it is perfectly
possible. You will see the important bearing of this presently.

“To return now to my investigation. I had the bulk of a candle and a
tress of Stella’s hair. The questions to be settled were, 1. Was there
arsenic in the candle? and 2. Had Stella been poisoned with arsenic? I
began by trimming the wax mould in readiness for casting and then I
made an analysis of the trimmings. The result was the discovery of
considerable quantities of arsenic in the wax.

“That answered the first question. Next, as the tress of hair was
larger than was required for your purpose, I ventured to sacrifice a
portion of it for a preliminary test. That test also gave a positive
result. The quantity of arsenic was, of course, very minute, but still
it was measurable by the delicate methods that are possible in dealing
with arsenic; and the amount that I found pointed either to one large
dose or to repeated smaller ones.

“The two questions were now answered definitely. It was certain—and
the certainty could be demonstrated to a jury—that Stella had been
poisoned by arsenic, and that the arsenic had been administered by
means of poisoned candles. The complete proof in this case lent added
weight to the less complete proof in the case of Monkhouse; and the
two cases served to corroborate one another in pointing to Barbara as
the poisoner. For she was the common factor in the two cases. The
other persons—Wallingford, Madeline and the others—who appeared in the
Monkhouse case, made no appearance in the case of Stella; and the
persons who were associated with Stella were not associated with
Monkhouse. But Barbara was associated with both. And her absence from
home was no answer to the charge if death was caused by the candles
which she had admittedly supplied.

“But complete as the proof was, I wished, if possible, to make it yet
more complete: to associate Barbara still more definitely with the
crime. In the case of Monkhouse, it was clear that the poisoning
always occurred when she was absent from home. But this was not so
clear in the case of Stella. Your diary showed that Stella’s relapses
coincided pretty regularly with Barbara’s absences; but it was not
certain (though obviously probable) that the relapses coincided with
the periods of poisoning. If it could be proved that they did
coincide, that proof would furnish corroboration of the greatest
possible weight. It would show that the two cases were parallel in all
respects.

“But could it be proved? If the tress of Stella’s hair had been at my
disposal, I had no doubt that I could have decided the question. But
the tress was yours, and it had to be preserved. Whatever was to be
done must be done without destroying or injuring the hair, and I set
myself the task of finding some practicable method. Eventually, I
decided, without much hope of success, to try the X-rays. As arsenic
is a fairly dense metal and the quantity of it in the deposits quite
considerable, it seemed to me possible that it might increase the
density of the hairs at those points sufficiently to affect the X-ray
shadow. At any rate, I decided to give the method a trial.

“Accordingly, Polton and I set to work at it. First, in order to get
the densest shadow possible, we made the tress up into a close
cylinder, carefully arranging it so that all the cut ends were in
exactly the same plane. Then we made a number of graduated exposures
on ‘process’ plates, developing and intensifying with the object of
getting the greatest possible degree of contrast. The result was
unexpectedly successful. In the best negative, the shape of the tress
was faintly visible and was soon to be crossed by a number of
perfectly distinct pale bands. Those bands were the shadows of the
deposits of arsenic. There could be no doubt on the subject. For,
apart from the fact that there was nothing else that they could be,
their appearance agreed exactly with what one would have expected.
Each band presented a sharp, distinct edge towards the tips of the
hairs and faded away imperceptibly towards the roots. The sharp edge
corresponded to the sudden appearance of arsenic in the blood when the
poisoning began. The gradual fading away corresponded to the period of
elimination when the poisoning had ceased and the quantity of arsenic
in the blood was becoming less and less from day to day.

“Now, since hair grows at a known, uniform rate, it was possible to
convert the distances between these arsenical bands into periods of
time; not with perfect exactness, because the rate of growth varies
slightly in different persons, but with sufficient exactness for our
present purpose. As soon as I looked at those bands, I saw that they
told the whole story. But let us follow the method of proof.

“Assuming the rate of growth to be one fiftieth of an inch in
twenty-four hours—which was probably correct for a person of Stella’s
age—I measured off on the photograph seven inches and a quarter from
the cut ends as representing the last year of her life. Of course, I
did not know how close to the head the hair had been cut, but, judging
by the bands, I assumed that it had been cut quite close to the
skin—within a quarter of an inch.”

“I happen to know that you were quite right,” said I, “but I can’t
imagine how you arrived at your conclusion.”

“It was quite a simple inference,” he replied, “as you will see,
presently. But to return to the photograph. Of the measured space of
seven inches and a quarter I took a tracing on sheet celluloid,
marking the sharp edges of the bands, the points at which the fading
began and the points at which the band ceased to be visible. This
tracing I transferred to paper ruled in tenths of an inch—a tenth of
an inch representing five days—and I joined the points where the
fading began and ended by a sloping line. I now had a diagram, or
chart, which showed, with something approaching to accuracy, the
duration of each administration of arsenic and the time which elapsed
between the successive poisonings. This is the chart. The sloping
lines show the fading of the bands.”

He handed me a paper which he had just taken from a drawer and I
looked at it curiously but with no great interest. As I returned it
after a brief inspection I remarked:

“It is quite clear and intelligible, but I don’t quite see why you
took the considerable trouble of making it. Does it show anything that
could not be stated in a few words?”

“Not by itself,” he replied. “But you remember that I mentioned having
made two other charts, one showing the fluctuations in Stella’s
illness and the other showing Barbara’s absences from home during the
same period. Here are those other two charts; and now, if you put the
three together, your eye can take in at a glance a fact of fundamental
importance; which is that the relapses, the absences and the
poisonings all coincided in time. The periodicity is strikingly
irregular; but it is identical in all three charts. I made these to
hand to the jury, and I think they would have been quite convincing,
since any juryman could check them by the dates given in evidence, and
by inspection of the radiograph of the hair.”

  [Illustration: Three charts, labelled “A,” “B,” and “C,” each marked
  horizontally with the names of months. Charts A and B
  are line graphs, while Chart C marks off certain periods of time
  with solid blocks. Each chart shows five peaks occurring at the same
  points in time.]

  Explanation of the Charts

  Chart A shows the fluctuations in the illness of Stella Keene during
  the year preceding her death in October. Divided into intervals of
  five days.

  Chart B shows the distribution of the arsenical bands in Stella
  Keene’s hair. The steep sides of the curves, towards the tips of the
  hairs, show the sudden appearance of the deposit, and the sloping
  sides, towards the roots of the hairs, represent its more gradual
  fading. Each of the narrow divisions represents five days’ growth.

  Chart C shows the periods during which Barbara was absent from home,
  each absence being represented by a black column. Divided into
  intervals of five days.

I gazed at the three charts and was profoundly impressed by the
convincing way in which they demonstrated the connection between
Barbara’s movements and the results of her diabolical activities. But
what impressed me still more was the amazing ingenuity with which
Thorndyke had contrived to build up a case of the most deadly
precision and completeness out of what seemed, even to my trained
intelligence, no more than a few chance facts, apparently quite
trivial and irrelevant.

“It seems,” I said, “that, so far as you were concerned, the
exhumation was really unnecessary.”

“Quite,” he replied. “It proved nothing that was not already certain.
Still, the Commissioner was quite right. For the purposes of a trial,
evidence obtained from the actual body of the victim is of
immeasurably more weight than indirect scientific evidence, no matter
how complete. An ordinary juryman might have difficulty in realizing
that the hair is part of the body and that proof of arsenical deposit
in the hair is proof of arsenic in the body. But the mistake that he
made, as events turned out, was in refusing to make the arrest until
my statements had been confirmed by the autopsy and the analysis. That
delay allowed the criminal to escape. Not that I complain. To me,
personally, her suicide came as a blessed release from an almost
intolerable position. But if I had been in his place, I would have
taken no chances. She would have gone to trial and to the gallows.”

“Yes,” I admitted; “that was what justice demanded. But I cannot be
thankful enough for the delay that let her escape. Fiend as she was,
it would have been a frightful thing to have had to give the evidence
that would have hanged her.”

“It would,” he agreed; “and the thought of it was a nightmare to me.
However, we have escaped that; and after all, justice has been done.”

We were silent for a few minutes, during which Thorndyke smoked his
pipe with a certain air of attention as if he expected me to put some
further questions. And, in fact, there were one or two questions that
I wanted to have answered. I began with the simplest.

“I am still a little puzzled by some of the circumstances in this
case. The infernal machine I happen to know to have been sent by
Barbara, though I don’t understand why she sent it. But Wallingford’s
proceedings are a complete mystery to me. What do you suppose induced
him to keep a watch on you in that extraordinary fashion? And who was
the man who shadowed him? There certainly was such a man, for I saw
him, myself. And the same man had been shadowing Miss Norris. What do
you make of it all?”

“One can only reason from past experiences,” he replied. “It seems to
be a rule that a person who has committed a crime cannot remain quiet
and let things take their course. There appears to be an irresistible
impulse to lay down false clues and create misleading appearances. It
is always a mistake, unless the false clues are laid down in advance,
and even then it is apt to fail and unexpectedly furnish a real clue.

“Now Barbara, with all her astonishing cleverness, made that mistake.
She laid down a false clue in advance by her absences from home, and
the trick certainly worked successfully at the inquest. But it was
precisely those absences that put me on the track of the candle, which
otherwise might have passed unsuspected. The faked medicine was
another false clue which attracted my attention and added to my
suspicion concerning the candle. Then, after the event came these
other endeavours to mislead. They did neither harm nor good, as it
happened, since I had already marked her down as the principal
suspect. But if I had been in doubt, I should have followed up those
clues and found her at the end of them.

“As to Wallingford, I imagine that she led him to believe that I was
employed by you to fix the crime on him and that he was advised to
watch me and be ready to anticipate any move on my part; her actual
object being to cause him to behave in such a manner as to attract
suspicious attention. The function of the private detective—for that
is what he must have been—would be to keep Wallingford’s nerves—and
Miss Norris’s, too—in such a state that they would appear anxious and
terrified and tend to attract attention. The infernal machine was
primarily intended, I think, to cast suspicion on one or both of them.
That was what I inferred from the total absence of finger-prints and
the flagrantly identifiable character of the pistol and the wool.

“But the greatest, the most fatal mistake that Barbara made was the
one that is absolutely characteristic of the criminal. She repeated
the procedure of a previous crime that had been successful. It was
that repetition that was her undoing. Either crime, separately, might
have been difficult to fix on her. As it was, each crime was proof of
the other.”

Once more we fell silent; and still Thorndyke had the air of expecting
some further question from me. I looked at him nervously; for there
was something that I wanted to ask and yet I hardly dared to put it
into words. For, as I had looked at those charts, a horrid suspicion
had taken hold of me. I feared to have it confirmed, and yet I could
not let it rest. At last, I summoned courage enough to put the
question.

“Thorndyke,” I said, “I want you to tell me something. I expect you
know what it is.”

He looked up and nodded gravely.

“You mean about Stella?” said he.

“Yes. How long would she have lived if she had not been poisoned?”

He looked away for a few moments, and, impassive as his face was, I
could see that he was deeply moved. At length he replied:

“I was afraid you were going to ask me that. But since you have, I can
only answer you honestly. So far as I can judge, but for that accursed
ghoul, the poor girl might have been alive and well at this moment.”

I stared at him in amazement. “Do you mean,” I demanded, “that she was
not really suffering from consumption at all?”

“That is what it amounts to,” he replied. “There were signs of old
tubercular trouble, but there was nothing recent. Evidently she had
good powers of resistance, and the disease had not only become
stationary, but was practically extinct. The old lesions had undergone
complete repair, and there is no reason to suppose that any recurrence
would have taken place under ordinary conditions.”

“But,” I exclaimed, hardly able to believe that the disaster had been
so overwhelmingly complete, “what about the cough? I know that she
always had a more or less troublesome cough.”

“So had Monkhouse,” he replied; “and so would any one have had whose
lungs were periodically irritated by inhaling particles of arsenious
acid. But the tubercular mischief was quite limited and recovery must
have commenced early. And Barbara, watching eagerly the symptoms of
the disease which was to rid her of her rival, must have noted with
despair the signs of commencing recovery and at last resolved to do
for herself what nature was failing to do. Doubtless, the special
method of poisoning was devised to imitate the symptoms of the
disease; which it did well enough to deceive those whose minds were
prepared by the antecedent illness to receive the suggestion. It was a
horribly, fiendishly ingenious crime; calmly, callously devised and
carried out to its appalling end with the most hideous efficiency.”

After he had finished speaking, I remained gazing at him dumbly,
stupefied, stunned by the realization of the enormity of this
frightful thing that had befallen. He, too, seemed quite overcome, for
he sat silently, grasping his extinct pipe and looking sternly and
fixedly into the fire. At length he spoke, but without removing his
gaze from the bright embers.

“I am trying, Mayfield,” he said, gently, “to think of something to
say to you. But there is nothing to say. The disaster is too complete,
too irretrievable. This terrible woman has, so far, wrecked your life,
and I recognize that you will carry the burden of your loss so long as
you live. It would be a mere impertinence to utter futile and banal
condolences. You know what I, your friend, am feeling and I need say
no more of that; and I have too much confidence in your wisdom and
courage to think of exhortations.

“But, though you have been robbed of the future that might have been,
there is still a future that may be. It remains to you now only to
shoulder your fardel and begin your pilgrimage anew; and if the road
shall seem at first a dreary one, you need not travel it alone. You
have friends; and one of them will think it a privilege to bear you
company and try to hearten you by the way.”

He held out his hand and I grasped it silently and with a full heart.
And the closer friendship that was inaugurated in that hand-clasp has
endured through the passing years, ever more precious and more
helpful.

 THE MYSTERY OF
 ANGELINA FROOD

 CHAPTER I.
 THE DOPER’S WIFE

It takes a good deal to surprise a really seasoned medical
practitioner, and still more to arouse in him an abiding curiosity.
But at the time when I took charge of Dr. Pumphrey’s practice in
Osnaburgh-street, Regent’s Park, I was far from being a seasoned
practitioner, having, in fact, been qualified little more than a year,
in which short period I had not yet developed the professional
immunity from either of the above mental states. Hence the singular
experience which I am about to relate not only made a deep impression
on me at the time, but remained with me for long after as a matter of
curious speculation.

It was close upon midnight, indeed an adjacent church clock had
already struck the third quarter, when I laid aside my book and yawned
profoundly, without prejudice to the author who had kept me so long
from my bed. Then I rose and stretched myself, and was in the act of
knocking the long-extinct ashes out of my pipe when the bell rang. As
the servants had gone to bed, I went out to the door, congratulating
myself on having stayed up beyond my usual bedtime, but wishing the
visitor at the devil all the same. The opening of the door gave me a
view of a wet street with a drizzle of rain falling, a large closed
car by the kerb, and a tallish man on the doorstep, apparently about
to renew his attack on the bell.

“Dr. Pumphrey?” he asked; and by that token I gathered that he was a
stranger.

“No,” I answered; “he is out of town, but I am looking after his
practice.”

“Very well,” he said, somewhat brusquely. “I want you to come and see
a lady who has been suddenly taken ill. She has had a rather severe
shock.”

“Do you mean a mental or a physical shock?” I asked.

“Well, I should say mental,” he replied, but so inconclusively that I
pressed him for more definite particulars.

“Has she sustained any injuries?” I inquired.

“No,” he answered, but still indecisively. “No; that is, so far as I
know. I think not.”

“No wound, for instance?”

“No,” he replied, promptly and very definitely; from which I was
disposed to suspect that there was an injury of some other kind. But
it was of no use guessing. I hurried back into the surgery, and,
having snatched up the emergency bag and my stethoscope, rejoined my
visitor, who forthwith hustled me into the car. The door slammed, and
the vehicle moved off with the silent, easy motion of a powerful
engine.

We started towards Marylebone-road and swept round into Albany-street,
but after that I lost my bearings: for the fine rain had settled on
the windows so that it was difficult to see through them, and I was
not very familiar with the neighbourhood. It seemed quite a short
journey, but a big car is very deceptive as to distance. At any rate,
it occupied but a few minutes, and during that time my companion and I
exchanged hardly a word. As the car slowed down I asked:

“What is this lady’s name?”

“Her name,” he replied, in a somewhat hesitating manner, “is--she is a
Mrs. Johnson.”

The manner of the reply suggested a not very intimate acquaintance,
which seemed odd under the circumstances, and I reflected on it
rapidly as I got out of the car and followed my conductor. We seemed
to be in a quiet bystreet of the better class, but it was very dark,
and I had but a glimpse as I stepped from the car to the gate of the
house. Of the latter, all that I was able to note was that it appeared
to be of a decent, rather old-fashioned type, standing behind a small
front garden, that the windows were fitted with jalousie shutters, and
that the number on the door was 43.

As we ascended the steps the door opened, and a woman was dimly
discernible behind it. A lighted candle was on the hall table, and
this my conductor picked up, requesting me to follow him up the
stairs. When we arrived at the first floor landing, he halted and
indicated a door which was slightly ajar.

“That is the room,” said he; and with that he turned and retired down
the stairs.

I stood for a few moments on the dark landing, deeply impressed by the
oddity of the whole affair, and sensible of a growing suspicion, which
was not lessened when, by the thin line of light from within the room,
I observed on the door-jamb one or two bruises as if the door had been
forced from without. However, this was none of my business, and thus
reflecting, I was about to knock at the door when four fingers
appeared round the edge of it and drew it further open, and a man’s
head became visible in the opening.

The fingers and the head were alike such as instantly to rivet the
attention of a doctor. The former were of the kind known as “clubbed
fingers,” fingers with bulbous ends, of which the nails curved over
like nut-shells. The head, in form like a great William pear,
presented a long, coffin-shaped face with high cheek-bones, deep-set
eyes with narrow, slanting eye-slits, and a lofty, square forehead
surmounted by a most singular mop of mouse-coloured hair which stood
straight up like the fur of a mole.

“I am the doctor,” said I, having taken in these particulars in an
instantaneous glance, and having further noted that the man’s eyes
were reddened and wet. He made no reply, but drew the door open and
retired, whereupon I entered the room, closing the door behind me, and
thereby becoming aware that there was something amiss with the latch.

The room was a bed-room, and on the bed lay a woman, fully clothed,
and apparently in evening dress, though the upper part of her person
was concealed by a cloak which was drawn up to her chin. She was a
young woman--about twenty-eight, I judged--comely, and, in fact,
rather handsome, but deadly pale. She was not, however, unconscious,
for she looked at me listlessly, though with a certain attention. In
some slight embarrassment, I approached the bed, and, as the man had
subsided into a chair in a corner of the room, I addressed myself to
the patient.

“Good evening, Mrs. Johnson. I am sorry to see you looking so ill.
What is the matter? I understand that you have had some kind of
shock.”

As I addressed her, I seemed to detect a faint expression of surprise,
but she replied at once, in a weak voice that was little more than a
whisper: “Yes. I have had rather an upset. That is all. They need not
really have troubled you.”

“Well, you don’t look very flourishing,” said I, taking the wrist that
was uncovered by her mantle, “and your hand is as cold as a fish.”

I felt her pulse, checking it by my watch, and meanwhile looking her
over critically. And not her alone. For on the wall opposite me was a
mirror in which, by a little judicious adjustment of position, I was
able to observe the other occupant of the room while keeping my back
towards him; and what I observed was that he was sitting with his
elbows on his knees, and his face buried in his hands.

“Might one inquire,” I asked, as I put away my watch, “what kind of
shock it is that you are suffering from?”

The faintest trace of a smile stole across her pale face as she
answered: “That isn’t really a medical question, Doctor, is it?”

“Perhaps it isn’t,” I replied, though, of course, it was. But I
thought it best to waive the question, as there seemed to be some
reservation; and, noting this latter fact, I again considered her
attentively. Whatever her condition was, and whatever it might be due
to, I had to form my opinion unassisted, for I could see that no
information would be furnished; and the question that I had to settle
was whether her state was purely mental, or whether it was complicated
by any kind of physical injury. The waxen pallor of her face made me
uneasy, and I found it difficult to interpret the expression of the
set features. Some strong emotion had left its traces; but whether
that emotion was grief, horror, or fear, or whether the expression
denoted bodily pain, I could not determine. She had closed her eyes,
and her face was like a death mask, save that it lacked the serenity
of a dead face.

“Are you in any pain?” I asked, with my fingers still on the thready
pulse. But she merely shook her head wearily, without opening her
eyes.

It was very unsatisfactory. Her appearance was consistent with all
kinds of unpleasant possibilities, as was also the strange atmosphere
of secrecy about the whole affair. Nor was the attitude of that
ill-favoured man whom I could see in the glass, still sitting hunched
up with his face buried in his hands, at all reassuring. And gradually
my attention began to focus itself upon the cloak which covered the
woman’s body and was drawn around her neck up to her chin. Did that
cloak conceal anything? It seemed incredible, seeing that they had
sent for a doctor. But the behaviour of everybody concerned was
incredibly irrational. I produced my stethoscope, which was fitted
with a diaphragm that enabled one to hear through the clothing, and,
drawing the cloak partly aside, applied the chest-piece over the
heart. On this the patient opened her eyes and made a movement of her
hand towards the upper part of the cloak. I listened carefully to her
heart--which was organically sound, though a good deal disordered in
action--and moved the stethoscope once or twice, drawing aside the
cloak by degrees. Finally, with a somewhat quick movement, I turned it
back completely.

“Why,” I exclaimed, “what on earth have you been doing to your neck?”

“That mark?” she said in a half-whisper. “It is nothing. It was made
by a gold collar that I wore yesterday. It was rather tight.”

“I see,” said I--truthfully enough; for the explanation of her
condition was now pretty clear up to a certain point. Of course, I did
not believe her. I did not suppose that she expected me to. But it was
evidently useless to dispute her statement or make any comment. The
mark upon her neck was a livid bruise made by some cord or band that
had been drawn tight with considerable force; and it was not more than
an hour old. How or by whom the injury had been inflicted was not, in
a medical sense, my concern. But I was by no means clear that I had
not some responsibilities in the case other than the professional
ones.

At this moment the man in the corner uttered a deep groan and
exclaimed in low, intense tones, “My God! My God!” Then, to my extreme
embarrassment, he began to sob audibly.

It was excessively uncomfortable. I looked from the woman--into whose
ghastly face an expression of something like disgust and contempt had
stolen--to the huddled figure in the glass. And as I looked, the man
plunged one hand into his pocket and dragged out a handkerchief,
bringing with it a little paper packet that fell to the floor.
Something in the appearance of that packet, and especially in the
hasty grab to recover it and the quick, furtive glance towards me that
accompanied the action, made a new and sinister suggestion--a
suggestion that the man’s emotional, almost hysterical state
supported, and that lent a certain unpleasant congruity to the
otherwise inexplicable circumstances. That packet, I had little doubt,
contained cocaine. The question was how did that fact--if it were a
fact--bear on my patient’s condition.

I inspected her afresh, and felt her pulse again. In the man’s case
the appearances were distinctive enough. His nerves were in rags, and
even across the room I could see that the hand that held the
handkerchief shook as if with a palsy. But in the woman’s condition
there was no positive suggestion of drugs; and something in her
face--a strong, resolute face despite its expression of suffering--and
her quiet, composed manner when she spoke, seemed to exclude the idea.
However, there was no use in speculating. I had got all the
information I was likely to get, and all that remained for me to do
was to administer such treatment as my imperfect understanding of the
case indicated. Accordingly I opened my emergency bag, and, taking out
a couple of little bottles and a measure-glass, went over to the
washstand and mixed a draught in the tumbler, diluting it from the
water-bottle.

In crossing the room, I passed the fire-place, where, on and above the
mantelpiece, I observed a number of signed photographs, apparently of
actors and actresses, including two of my patient, both of which were
in character costume and unsigned. From which it seemed probable that
my patient was an actress; a probability that was strengthened by the
hour at which I had been summoned and by certain other appearances in
the room with which Dr. Pumphrey’s largely theatrical practice had
made me familiar. But, as my patient would have remarked, this was not
a medical question.

“Now, Mrs. Johnson,” I said, when I had prepared the draught--and as I
spoke she opened her eyes and looked at me with a slightly puzzled
expression--“I want you to drink this.”

She allowed me to sit her up enough to enable her to swallow the
draught; and as her head was raised, I took the opportunity to glance
at the back of her neck, where I thought I could distinctly trace the
crossing of the cord or band that had been drawn round it. She sank
back with a sigh, but remained with her eyes open, looking at me as I
repacked my bag.

“I shall send you some medicine,” I said, “which you must take
regularly. It is unnecessary for me to say,” I added, addressing the
man, “that Mrs. Johnson must be kept very quiet, and in no way
agitated.”

He bowed, but made no reply; and I then took my leave.

“Good night, Mrs. Johnson,” I said, shaking her cold hand gently. “I
hope you will be very much better in an hour or two. I think you will
if you keep quite quiet and take your medicine.”

She thanked me in a few softly spoken words and with a very sweet
smile, of which the sad wistfulness went to my heart. I was loath to
leave her, in her weak and helpless state, to the care of her
unprepossessing companion, encompassed by I knew not what perils. But
I was only a passing stranger, and could do no more than my
professional office.

As I approached the door--with an inquisitive eye on its disordered
lock and loosened striking-box--the man rose, and made as if to let me
out. I wished him good-night, and he returned the salutation in a
pleasant voice, and with a distinctly refined accent, quite out of
character with his uncouth appearance. Feeling my way down the dark
staircase, I presently encountered my first acquaintance, who came to
the foot of the stairs with the candle.

“Well,” he said, in his brusque way, “how is she?”

“She is very weak and shaken,” I replied. “I want to send her some
medicine. Shall I take the address, or are you driving me back?”

“I will take you back in the car,” said he, “and you can give me the
medicine.”

The car was waiting at the gate, and we went out together. As I turned
to close the gate after me, I cast a quick glance at the house and its
surroundings, searching for some distinctive feature in case
recognition of the place should be necessary later. But it was a dark
night, though the rain had now ceased, and I could see no more than
that the adjoining house seemed to have a sort of corner turret,
crowned with a small cupola, and surmounted by a weather-vane.

During the short journey home not a word was spoken, and when the car
drew up at Dr. Pumphrey’s door and I let myself in with the key, my
companion silently followed me in. I prepared the medicine at once,
and handed it to him with a few brief instructions. He took it from
me, and then asked what my fee was.

“Do I understand that I am not required to continue the attendance?” I
asked.

“They will send for you, I suppose, if they want you,” he replied.
“But I had better pay your fee for this visit as I came for you.”

I named the fee, and, when he had paid it, I said: “You understand
that she will require very careful and tender treatment while she is
so weak?”

“I do,” he answered; “but I am not a member of the household. Did you
make it clear to Mr. ---- her husband?”

I noted the significant hesitation, and replied:

“I told him, but as to making it clear to him, I can’t say. His mental
condition was none of the most lucid. I hope she has someone more
responsible to look after her.”

“She has,” he replied; and then he asked: “You don’t think she is in
any danger, I hope?”

“In a medical sense,” I answered, “I think not. In other respects you
know better than I do.”

He gave me a quick look, and nodded slightly. Then, with a curt
“good-night,” he turned and went out to the car.

When he was gone, I made a brief record of the visit in the day-book,
and entered the fee in the cash column. In the case of the experienced
Dr. Pumphrey, this would have been the end of the transaction. But,
new as I was to medical practice, I was unable to take this
matter-of-fact view of its incidents. My mind still surged with
surprise, curiosity, and a deep concern for my fair patient. Filling
my pipe, I sat down before the gas fire to think over the mystery to
which I had suddenly become a party.

What was it that had happened in that house? Obviously, something
scandalous and sinister. The secrecy alone made that manifest. Not
only had the whereabouts of the house been withheld from me, but a
false name had been given. I realized that when my late visitor
stumbled over the name and substituted “her husband.” He had forgotten
what name it was that he had given on the spur of the moment. I
understood, too, the look of surprise that my patient had given when I
addressed her by that false name. Clearly, something had happened
which had to be hushed up if possible.

What was it? The elements of the problem, and the material for solving
it, were the mark on the woman’s neck, the condition of the door, and
a packet which I felt morally certain contained cocaine. I considered
these three factors separately and together.

The mark on the neck was quite recent. Its character was unmistakable.
A cord or band had been drawn tight and with considerable violence,
either by the woman herself, or by some other person: that is to say,
it was a case either of attempted suicide or attempted murder. To
which of these alternatives did the circumstances point?

There was the door. It had been broken in, and had therefore been
locked on the inside. That was consistent with suicide, but not
inconsistent with murder. Then, by whom had it been broken in? By a
murderer to get at his victim? Or by a rescuer? And if the latter, was
it to avert suicide or murder?

Again, there was the drug--assumed, but almost certain. What was the
bearing of that? Could these three persons be a party of “dopers,” and
the tragedy the outcome of an orgy of drug-taking? I rejected this
possibility at once. It was not consistent with the patient’s
condition nor with her appearance or manner; and the man who had
fetched me and brought me back was a robust, sane-looking man who
seemed quite beyond suspicion.

I next considered the persons. There were three of them: two men and a
woman. Of the men, one was a virile, fairly good-looking man of
perhaps forty; the other--the husband--was conspicuously
unprepossessing, physically degenerate and mentally, as I judged, a
hysterical poltroon. Here there seemed to be the making of trouble,
especially when one considered the personal attractiveness of the
woman.

I recalled her appearance very vividly. A handsome woman, not,
perhaps, actually beautiful--though she might have been that if the
roses of youth and health had bloomed in those cheeks that I had seen
blanched with that ghastly pallor. But apart from mere comeliness,
there was a suggestion of a pleasing, gracious personality. I don’t
know how it had been conveyed to me, excepting by the smile with which
she had thanked me and bidden me farewell: a smile that had imparted a
singular sweetness to her face. But I had received that impression,
and also that she was a woman of decided character and intelligence.

Her appearance was rather striking. She had a great mass of dark hair,
parted in the middle, and drawn down over the temples, nearly covering
the ears; darkish grey eyes, and unusually strong, black, level
eyebrows, that almost met above the straight, shapely nose. Perhaps it
was those eyebrows that gave the strength and intensity to her
expression, aided by the compressed lips--though this was probably a
passing condition due to her mental state.

My cogitations were prolonged well into the small hours, but they led
to nothing but an open verdict. At length I rose with a slight shiver,
and, dismissing the topic from my mind, crept up to bed.

But both the persons and the incident refused to accept their
dismissal. For many days afterwards I was haunted by two faces; the
one, ugly, coffin-shaped, surmounted by a shock of soft, furry,
mouse-coloured hair; the other, sweet, appealing, mutely eloquent of
tragedy and sorrow. Of course, I received no further summons; and the
whereabouts of the house of mystery remained a secret until almost the
end of my stay in Osnaburgh-street. Indeed, it was on the very day
before Dr. Pumphrey’s return that I made the discovery.

I had been making a visit to a patient who lived near Regent’s Park,
and on my way back had taken what I assumed to be a short cut. This
led me into a quiet, old fashioned residential street, of which the
houses stood back behind small front gardens. As I walked along the
street I seemed to be aware of a faint sense of familiarity which
caused me to observe the houses with more than usual attention.
Presently I observed a little way ahead on the opposite side a house
with a corner turret topped by a cupola, which bore above it a
weather-vane. I crossed the road as I approached it, and looked
eagerly at the next house. Its identity was unmistakable. My attention
was immediately attracted by the jalousies with which the windows were
fitted, and on looking at the front door I observed that the number
was forty-three.

This, then, was the house of mystery, perhaps of crime. But whatever
that tragedy had been, its actors were there no longer. The windows
were curtainless and blank; an air of Spring-cleaning and preparation
pervaded the premises, and a bill on a little notice-board announced a
furnished house to let, and invited inquiries. For a moment, I was
tempted to accept that invitation. But I was restrained by a feeling
that it would be in a way a breach of confidence. The names of those
persons had been purposely withheld from me, doubtless for excellent
reasons, and professional ethics seemed to forbid any unauthorized
pryings into their private affairs. Wherefore, with a valedictory
glance at the first-floor window, which I assumed to be that of the
room that I had entered, I went on my way, telling myself that, now,
the incident was really closed, and that I had looked my last on the
persons who had enacted their parts in it.

In which, however, I was mistaken. The curtain was down on the first
act, but the play was not over. Only the succeeding acts were yet in
the unfathomed future. “Coming events cast their shadows before them”;
but who can interpret those shadows, until the shapes which cast them
loom up, plain and palpable, to mock at their own unheeded
premonitions?




 CHAPTER II.
 RE-ENTER “MR. JOHNSON”

It was a good many months before the curtain rose on the second act
of the drama of which this narrative is the record. Rather more than a
year had passed, and in that time certain changes had taken place in
my condition, of which I need refer only to the one that, indirectly,
operated as the cause of my becoming once more a party to the drama
aforesaid. I had come into a small property, just barely sufficient to
render me independent, and to enable me to live in idleness, if
idleness had been my hobby. As it was not, I betook myself to
Adam-street, Adelphi, to confer with my trusty medical agent, Mr.
Turcival, and from that conference was born my connexion with the
strange events which will be hereafter related.

Mr. Turcival had several practices to sell, but only one that he
thought quite suitable. “It is a death vacancy,” said he, “at
Rochester. A very small practice, and you won’t get much out of it, as
the late incumbent was an old man and you are a young man--and you
look ten years younger since you shaved off that fine beard and
moustache. But it is going for a song, and you can afford to wait; and
you couldn’t have a more pleasant place to wait in than Rochester.
Better go down and have a look at it. I’ll write to the local agents,
Japp and Bundy, and they will show you the house and effects. What do
you say?”

I said “yes”; and so favourably was I impressed that the very next day
found me in a first-class compartment en route for Rochester, with a
substantial portmanteau in the guard’s van.

At Dartford it became necessary to change, and as I sauntered on the
platform, waiting for the Rochester train, my attention was attracted
to a man who sat, somewhat wearily and dejectedly, on a bench, rolling
a cigarette. I was impressed by the swift dexterity with which he
handled the paper and tobacco, a dexterity that was explained by the
colour of his fingers, which were stained to the hue of mahogany. But
my attention was quickly diverted from the colour of the fingers to
their shape. They were clubbed fingers. At the moment when I observed
the fact I was looking over his shoulder from behind, and could not
see his face. But I could see that he had a large, pear-shaped head,
surmounted by an enormous cap, from beneath which a mass of
mouse-coloured hair stuck out like untidy thatch.

I suppose I must have halted unconsciously, for he suddenly looked
round, casting at me a curious, quick, furtive, suspicious glance. He
evidently did not recognize me--naturally, since my appearance was so
much changed; but I recognized him instantly. He was “Mr. ----, her
husband.” And his appearance was not improved since I had last seen
him. Inspecting him from the front, I observed that he was sordidly
shabby and none too clean, and that his large, rough boots were white
with dust as if from a long tramp on the chalky Kentish roads.

When the train came in, I watched him saunter to a compartment a few
doors from my own, rolling a fresh cigarette as he went: and at each
station when we stopped, I looked out of the window to see where he
got out. But he made no appearance until the train slowed down at
Rochester when I alighted quickly and strolled towards his
compartment. It had evidently been well filled, for a number of
passengers emerged before he appeared, contesting the narrow doorway
with a stout workman. As he squeezed past, the skirt of his coat
caught and was drawn back, revealing a sheath-knife of the kind known
to seamen as “Green River,” attached to a narrow leather belt. I did
not like the look of that knife. No landsman has any legitimate use
for such a weapon. And the fact that this man habitually carried about
him the means of inflicting lethal injuries--for it had no other
purpose--threw a fresh light, if any were needed, on the sinister
events of that memorable night in the quiet house near Regent’s Park.

As I had to look after my luggage, I lost sight of him; and when
having deposited my portmanteau in the cloak room, I walked out across
the station approach and looked up and down the street, he was nowhere
to be seen. Dimly wondering what this man might be doing in Rochester,
and whether his handsome wife were here, too--assuming her to be still
in existence--I turned and began to saunter slowly westward. I had
walked but two or three hundred yards when the door of a tavern which
I was approaching opened, and a man emerged, licking his lips with
uncommon satisfaction, and rolling a cigarette. It was my late
fellow-traveller. He stood by the tavern door, looking about him, and
glancing at the people on the footway. Just as I was passing him, he
approached me and spoke.

“I wonder,” said he, “if you happen to know a Mrs. Frood who lives
somewhere about here.”

“I am afraid I don’t,” I replied, thankful to be able to tell the
truth--for I should have denied knowledge of her in any case. “I am a
stranger to the town at present.”

He thanked me and turned away, and I walked on, but no longer at a
saunter, wondering who Mrs. Frood might be and keeping an eye on the
numbers of the houses on the opposite side of the street.

A few minutes’ walk brought into view the number I was seeking,
painted in the tympanum of a handsome Georgian portico appertaining to
one of a pair of pleasant old redbrick houses. I halted to inspect
these architectural twins before crossing the road. Old houses always
interest me, and these two were particularly engaging, as their owners
apparently realized, for they were in the pink of condition, and the
harmony of the quiet green woodwork and the sober red brick was no
chance effect. Moreover they were painted alike to carry out the
intention of the architect, who had evidently designed them to form a
single composition; to which end he had very effectively placed,
between the twin porticoes, a central door which gave access to a
passage common to the two houses and leading, no doubt, to the back
premises.

Having noted these particulars, I crossed the road and approached the
twin which bore beside its doorway a brass plate, inscribed “Japp and
Bundy, Architects and Surveyors.” In the adjoining bay window, in
front of a green curtain, was a list of houses to let; and as I paused
for a moment to glance at this, a face decorated with a pair of
colossal tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles, rose slowly above the
curtain, and then, catching my eye, popped down again with some
suddenness.

I ascended the short flight of steps to the open street door, and
entering the hall, opened the office door and walked in. The owner of
the spectacles was perched on a high stool at a higher desk with his
back to me, writing in a large book. The other occupant of the office
was a small, spare, elderly man, with a pleasant wrinkly face and a
cockatoo-like crest of white hair, who confronted me across a large
table on which a plan was spread out. He looked up interrogatively as
I entered, and I proceeded at once to announce myself.

“I am Dr. Strangeways,” said I, drawing a bundle of papers from my
pocket. “Mr. Turcival--the medical agent, you know--thought I had
better come down and settle things up on the spot. So here I am.”

“Precisely,” said my new acquaintance, motioning me to a chair--it was
a shield-back Heppelwhite, I noticed--“I agree with Mr. Turcival. It
is all quite plain sailing. The position is this: Old Dr. Partridge
died about three weeks ago, and the executor of his will, who lives in
Northumberland, has instructed us to realize his estate. We have
valued the furniture, fittings, and effects, have added a small amount
to cover the drugs and instruments and the goodwill of the practice,
and this is the premium. It is practically just the value of the
effects.”

“And the lease of the house?”

“Expired some years ago and we allowed Dr. Partridge to remain as a
yearly tenant, which he preferred. You could do the same or you could
have a lease, if you wished.”

“Is the house your property?” I asked.

“No; but we manage it for the owner, a Mrs. Frood.”

“Oh, it belongs to Mrs. Frood, does it?”

He looked up at me quickly, and I noticed that the gentleman at the
desk had stopped writing. “Do you know Mrs. Frood?” he asked.

“No; but it happens that a man who came down by my train asked me a
few minutes ago if I could give him her address. Fortunately I
couldn’t.”

“Why fortunately?”

The question brought me up short. My prejudice against the man was due
to my knowledge of his antecedents, which I was not prepared to
disclose. I therefore replied evasively:

“Well, I wasn’t very favourably impressed by his appearance. He was a
shabby-looking customer. I suspected that he was a cadger of some
kind.”

“Indeed! Now, what sort of a person was he? Could you describe him?”

“He was a youngish man--from thirty-five to forty, I should
say--apparently well educated but very seedy and not particularly
clean. A queer-looking man, with a big, pear-shaped head and a mop of
hair like the fur of a Persian cat. His fingers are clubbed at the
ends, and stained with tobacco to the knuckles. Do you know him?”

“I rather suspect I do. What do you say, Bundy?”

Mr. Bundy grunted. “Hubby, I ween,” said he.

“You don’t mean Mrs. Frood’s husband?” I exclaimed.

“I do. And it is, as you said, very fortunate that you were not able
to give him her address, as she is unable to live with him and is at
present unwilling to let him know her whereabouts. It is an
unfortunate affair. However, to return to your business; you had
better go up and have a look at the house and see what you think of
it. You might just walk up with Dr. Strangeways, Bundy.”

Mr. Bundy swung round on his stool, and, taking off his spectacles,
stuck in his right eye a gold-rimmed monocle, through which he
inspected me critically. Then he hopped off the stool, and, lifting
the lid of the desk, took out a velour hat and a pair of chamois
gloves, the former of which he adjusted carefully on his head before a
small mirror, and, having taken down a labelled key from a key-board
and provided himself with a smart, silver-mounted cane, announced that
he was ready.

As I walked along the picturesque old street at Mr. Bundy’s side, I
reverted to my late fellow passenger and my prospective landlady.

“I gather,” said I, “that Mrs. Frood’s matrimonial affairs are
somewhat involved.”

“So do I,” said Bundy. “Seems to have made a regular mucker of it. I
don’t know much about her, myself, but Japp knows the whole story.
He’s some sort of relative of hers; uncle or second cousin or
something of the kind. But Japp is a bit like the sailor’s parrot; he
doesn’t let on unnecessarily.”

“What sort of a woman is Mrs. Frood?” I asked.

“Oh, quite a tidy sort of body. I’ve only seen her once or twice;
haven’t been here long myself: tallish woman; lot of black hair; thick
eye-brows; rather squeaky voice. Not exactly my idea of a beauty, but
Frood seems quite keen on her.”

“By the way, how comes it that he doesn’t know her address? She’s a
Rochester woman, isn’t she?”

“No. I don’t know where she comes from. London, I think. This property
was left to her by an aunt who lived here: a cousin of Japp’s.
Angelina came down here a few weeks ago on the q.t. to get away from
hubby, and I fancy she’s been keeping pretty close.”

“She’s living in lodgings, then, I suppose?”

“Yes; at least she lives in a set of offices that Japp furnished for
her, and the lady who rents the rest of the house looks after her. As
a matter of fact, the offices are next door to ours; but you had
better consider that information as confidential, at any rate while
hubby is in the neighbourhood. This is your shanty.”

He halted at the door of a rather small, red brick house, and while I
was examining the half-obliterated inscription on the brass plate, he
thrust the key into the lock and made ineffectual efforts to turn it.
Suddenly there was a loud click from within, followed by the clanking
of a chain and the drawing of bolts. Then the door opened slowly, and
a long-faced, heavy-browed, elderly woman surveyed us with a gloomy
stare.

“Why didn’t you ring the bell?” she demanded, gruffly.

“Had a key,” replied Bundy, extracting it, and flourishing it before
her face.

“And what’s the good of a key when the door was bolted and chained?”

“But, naturally, I couldn’t see that the door was bolted and chained.”

“I suppose you couldn’t with that thing stuck in your eye. Well, what
do you want?”

“I have brought this gentleman, Dr. Strangeways, to see you. He has
seen your portraits in the shop windows and wished to be introduced.
Also he wants to look over the house. He thinks of taking the
practice.”

“Well, why couldn’t you say that before?” she demanded.

“Before what?” he inquired blandly.

She made no reply other than a low growl, and Bundy continued:

“This lady, Dr. Strangeways, is the renowned Mrs. Dunk, more
familiarly known as La Giaconda, who administered the domestic affairs
of the late Dr. Partridge, and is at present functioning as custodian
of the premises.” He concluded the presentation by a ceremonious bow
and a sweep of his hat, which Mrs. Dunk acknowledged by turning her
back on him and producing a large bunch of keys, with which she
proceeded to unlock the doors that opened on the hall.

“The upstairs rooms are unlocked,” she said, adding: “If you want me
you can ring the bell,” and with this she retired to the basement
stairs and vanished.

My examination of the rooms was rather perfunctory, for I had made up
my mind already. The premium was absurdly small, and I could see that
the house was furnished well enough for my immediate needs. As to the
practice, I had no particular expectations.

“Better have a look at the books,” said Bundy when we went into the
little surgery, “though Mr. Turcival has been through them, and I
daresay he has told you all about the practice.”

“Yes,” I answered, “he told me that the practice was very small and
that I probably shouldn’t get much of it, as Partridge was an old man
and I am a young one. Still, I may as well glance through the books.”

Bundy laid the day book and ledger on the desk and placed a stool by
the latter, and I seated myself and began to turn over the leaves and
note down a few figures on a slip of paper, while my companion
beguiled the time by browsing round the surgery, taking down bottles
and sniffing at their contents, pulling out drawers and inspecting the
instruments and appliances. A very brief examination of the books
served to confirm Mr. Turcival’s modest estimate of the practice, and
when I had finished, I closed them and turned round to report to Mr.
Bundy, who was, at the moment, engaged in “sounding” the surgery clock
with the late Dr. Partridge’s stethoscope.

“I think it will do,” said I. “The practice is negligible, but the
furniture and fittings are worth the money, and I daresay I shall get
some patients in time. At any rate, the premises are all in going
order.”

“You are not dependent on the practice, then?” said he.

“No. I have enough just barely to exist on until the patients begin to
arrive. But what about the house?”

“You can have a lease if you like, or you can go on with the
arrangement that Partridge had. If I were you, I should take the house
on a three years’ agreement with the option of a lease later if you
find that the venture turns out satisfactorily.”

“Yes,” I agreed, “that seems a good arrangement. And when could I have
possession?”

“You’ve got possession now if you agree to the terms. Say yes, and
I’ll draft out the agreement when I get back. You and Mrs. Frood can
sign it this evening. You give us a cheque and we give you your copy
of the document, and the thing is d-u-n, done.”

“And what about this old woman?”

“La Giaconda Dunkibus? I should keep her if I were you. She looks an
old devil, but she’s a good servant. Partridge had a great opinion of
her, so Japp tells me, and you can see for yourself that the house is
in apple-pie order and as clean as a new pin.”

“You think she would be willing to stay?”

Bundy grinned (he was a good deal given to grinning, and he certainly
had a magnificent set of teeth). “Willing!” he exclaimed. “She’s going
to stay whether you want her or not. She has been here the best part
of her life and nothing short of a torpedo would shift her. You’ll
have to take her with the fixtures, but I don’t think you’ll regret
it.”

As Bundy was speaking, I had been, half-unconsciously, looking him
over, interested in the queer contrast between his almost boyish
appearance and gay irresponsible manner on the one hand, and, on the
other, his shrewdness, his business capacity, and his quick, decisive,
evidently forceful character.

To look at, he was just a young “nut,” small, spruce, dandified, and
apparently not displeased with himself. His age I judged to be about
twenty-five, his height about five feet six. In figure, he was slight,
but well set-up, and he seemed active and full of life and energy. He
was extraordinarily well turned-out. From his close-cropped head, with
the fore-lock “smarmed” back in the correct “nuttish” fashion, so that
his cranium resembled a large black-topped filbert, to his
immaculately polished and remarkably small shoes, there was not an
inch of his person that had not received the most careful attention.
He was clean-shaved; so clean that on the smooth skin nothing but the
faint blue tinge on cheek and chin remained to suggest the coarse and
horrid possibilities of whiskers. And his hands had evidently received
the same careful attention as his face; indeed, even as he was talking
to me, he produced from his pocket some kind of ridiculous little
instrument with which he proceeded to polish his finger-nails.

“Shall I ring the bell?” he asked after a short pause, “and call up
the spirit of the Dunklett from the vasty deep? May as well let her
know her luck.”

As I assented he pressed the bell-push, and in less than a minute Mrs.
Dunk made her appearance and stood in the doorway, looking inquiringly
at Bundy, but uttering no sound.

“Dr. Strangeways is going to take the practice, Mrs. Dunk,” said
Bundy, “inclusive of the house, furniture, and all effects, and he is
also prepared to take you at a valuation.”

As the light of battle began to gleam in Mrs. Dunk’s eyes, I thought
it best to intervene and conduct the negotiations myself.

“I understand from Mr. Bundy,” said I, “that you were Dr. Partridge’s
housekeeper for many years, and it occurred to me that you might be
willing to act in the same capacity for me. What do you say?”

“Very well,” she replied. “When do you want to move in?”

“I propose to move in at once. My luggage is at the station.”

“Have you checked the inventory?” she asked.

“No, I haven’t, but I suppose nothing has been taken away?”

“No,” she answered. “Everything is as it was when Dr. Partridge died.”

“Then we can go over the inventory later. I will have my things sent
up from the station, and I shall come in during the afternoon to
unpack.”

She agreed concisely to this arrangement, and, when we had settled a
few minor details, I departed with Bundy to make my way to the station
and thereafter to go in search of lunch.

“You think,” said I, as we halted opposite the station approach, “that
we can get everything completed to-day?”

“Yes,” he replied, “I will get the agreement drawn up in the terms
that we have just settled on, and will make an appointment with Mrs.
Frood. You had better look in at the office about half-past six.”

He turned away with a friendly nod and a flash of his white teeth, and
bustled off up the street, swinging his smart cane jauntily, and
looking, with his trim, well-cut clothes, his primrose-coloured
gloves, and his glistening shoes, the very type of cheerful,
prosperous, self-respecting and self-satisfied youth.




 CHAPTER III.
 ANGELINA FROOD

Punctually at half-past six I presented myself at the office of
Messrs. Japp and Bundy. The senior partner was seated at a
writing-table covered with legal-looking documents, and, as I entered,
he looked up with a genial, wrinkly smile of recognition, and then
turned to his junior.

“You’ve got Dr. Strangeways’s agreement ready, haven’t you, Bundy?” he
asked.

“Just finished it five minutes ago,” was the reply. “Here you are.”

Bundy swung round on his stool and held out the two copies. “Would you
mind going through it with Dr. Strangeways?” said Japp. “And then you
might go with him to Mrs. Frood’s and witness the signatures. I told
her you were coming.”

Bundy pulled out his watch, and glared at it through his great
spectacles.

“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “I’m afraid I can’t. There’s old Baldwin, you
know. I’ve got to be there at a quarter to seven.”

“So you have,” said Japp, “I had forgotten that. You had better be off
now. I’ll see to Dr. Strangeways, if he isn’t in a hurry for a minute
or two.”

“I’m not in a hurry at all,” said I. “Don’t put yourself out for me.”

“Well, if you really are not,” said Japp, “I’ll just finish what I am
doing, and then I’ll run in with you and get the agreement completed.
You might look through it while you are waiting and see that it is all
in order.”

Bundy handed me the agreement, and, as I sat down to study it, he
removed his spectacles, stuck his eye-glass in his eye, hopped off his
perch, brought forth his hat, gloves, and stick, and, having presented
his teeth for my inspection, took his departure.

I read through the agreement carefully to ascertain that it embodied
the terms agreed on verbally and compared the two copies. Then, while
Mr. Japp continued to turn over the leaves of his documents, I let my
thoughts stray from the trim, orderly office to the house of mystery
in London and the strange events that had befallen there on that rainy
night more than a year ago. Once more I called up before the eyes of
memory the face of my mysterious patient, sweet and gracious in spite
of its deathly pallor. Many a time, in the months that had passed, had
I recalled it: so often that it seemed, in a way, to have become
familiar. In a few minutes I was going to look upon that face
again--for there could be no reasonable doubt that my prospective
landlady was she. I looked forward expectantly, almost with
excitement, to the meeting. Would she recognize me? I wondered. And if
she did not, should I make myself known? This was a difficult
question, and I had come to no decision upon it when I was aroused
from my reverie by a movement on the part of Mr. Japp, whose labours
had apparently come to an end. Folding up the documents and securing
them in little bundles with red tape, he deposited them in a cupboard
with his notes, and from the same receptacle took out his hat.

“Now,” said he, “if you find the agreement in order, we will proceed
to execute it. Are you going to pay the premium now?”

“I have my cheque-book with me,” I replied. “When we have signed the
agreement, I will settle up for everything.”

“Thank you,” said he. “I have prepared a receipt which is,
practically, an assignment of the furniture and effects and of all
rights in the practice.”

He held the door open and I passed out. We descended the steps, and
passing the central door common to the two houses, ascended to that of
the adjoining house, where Mr. Japp executed a flourish on a handsome
brass knocker. In a few moments the door was opened by a woman whom I
could not see very distinctly in the dim hall, especially as she
turned about and retired up the stairs. Mr. Japp advanced to the door
of the front room and rapped with his knuckles, whereupon a high,
clear, feminine voice bade him come in. He accordingly entered, and I
followed.

The first glance disposed of any doubts that I might have had. The
lady who stood up to receive us was unquestionably my late patient,
though she looked taller than I had expected. But it was the
well-remembered face, less changed, indeed, than I could have wished,
for it was still pale, drawn, and weary, as I could see plainly enough
in spite of the rather dim light; for, although it was not yet quite
dark, the curtains were drawn and a lamp lighted on a small table,
beside which was a low easy-chair, on which some needlework had been
thrown down.

Mr. Japp introduced me to my future landlady, who bowed, and having
invited us to be seated, took up her needlework and sat down in the
easy-chair.

“You are not looking quite up to the mark,” Japp observed, regarding
her critically, as he turned over the papers.

“No,” she admitted, “I think I am a little run down.”

“H’m,” said Japp. “Oughtn’t to get run down at your age. Why, you are
only just wound up. However, you’ve got a doctor for a tenant, so you
will be able to take out some of the rent in medical advice. Let me
see, I told you what the terms of the agreement were, but you had
better look through it before you sign.”

He handed her one of the documents, which she took from him, and,
dropping her needlework in her lap, leaned back in her chair to read
it. Meanwhile, I examined her with a good deal of interest and
curiosity, wondering how she had fared and what had happened to her in
the months that had elapsed since I had last seen her. The light was
not very favourable for a minute inspection, for the lamp on the table
was the sole luminary, and that was covered by a red silk shade. But I
was confirmed in my original impression of her. She was more than
ordinarily good-looking, and rather striking in appearance, and I
judged that under happier conditions she might have appeared even more
attractive. As it was, the formally parted dark hair, the strongly
marked, straight eyebrows, the firm mouth, rather compressed and a
little drawn down at the corners, and the pale complexion imparted to
her face a character that was somewhat intense, sombre, and even
troubled. But, for this I could fully account from my knowledge of her
circumstances, and I was conscious of looking on her with a very
sympathetic and friendly eye.

“This is quite satisfactory to me,” she said at length, in the clear,
high-pitched voice to which Bundy had objected, “and if it is equally
so to Dr. Strangeways, I suppose I had better sign.”

She laid the paper on the table, and, taking the fountain-pen that
Japp proffered, signed her name, Angelina Frood, in a bold, legible
hand, and then returned the pen to its owner; who forthwith affixed
his signature as witness and spread out the duplicate for me to sign.
When this also was completed, he handed me the copy signed by Mrs.
Frood and the receipt for the premium, and I drew a cheque for the
amount and delivered it to him.

“Many thanks,” said he, slipping it into a wallet and pocketing it.
“That concludes our business and puts you finally in possession. I
wish you every success in your practice. By the way, I mentioned to
Mrs. Frood that you had seen her husband and that you know how she is
placed; and she agreed with me that it was best that you should
understand the position in case you should meet him again.”

“Certainly,” Mrs. Frood agreed. “There is no use in trying to make a
secret of it. He came down with you from London, Mr. Japp tells me.”

“Not from London,” said I. “He got in at Dartford.”

Here Mr. Japp rose and stole towards the door. “Don’t let me interrupt
you,” said he, “but I must get back to the office and hear what Bundy
has to report. Don’t get up. I can let myself out.”

He made his exit quietly, shutting the door after him, and as soon as
he was gone Mrs. Frood asked:

“Do you mean that he changed into your train at Dartford?”

“No,” I answered. “I think he came to Dartford on foot. He looked
tired and his boots were covered with white dust.”

“You are very observant, Dr. Strangeways,” she said. “I wonder what
made you notice him so particularly?”

“He is rather a noticeable man,” I said, and then, deciding that it
was better to be quite frank, I added: “But the fact is I had seen him
before.”

“Indeed!” said she. “Would you think me very inquisitive if I asked
where you had seen him?”

“Not at all,” I answered. “It was a little more than a year ago, about
twelve o’clock at night, in a house near Regent’s Park, to which I was
taken in a closed car to see a lady.”

As I spoke she dropped her needlework and sat up, gazing at me with a
startled and rather puzzled expression. “But,” she said, “you are not
the doctor who came to see me that night?”

“I am, indeed,” said I.

“Now,” she exclaimed, “isn’t that an extraordinary thing? I had a
feeling that I had seen you somewhere before. I seemed to recognize
your voice. But you don’t look the same. Hadn’t you a beard then?”

“Yes, I am but the shaven and shorn remnant of my former self, but I
am your late medical attendant.”

She looked at me with an odd, reflective, questioning expression, but
without making any further comment. Presently she said:

“You were very kind and sympathetic though you were so quiet. I wonder
what you thought of it all.”

“I hadn’t much to go on beyond the medical facts,” I replied
evasively.

“Oh, you needn’t be so cautious,” said she, “now that the cat is out
of the bag.”

“Well,” I said, “it was pretty obvious that there had been trouble of
some kind. The door had been broken open, there was one man in a state
of hysterics, another man considerably upset and rather angry, and a
woman with the mark on her neck of a cord or band----”

“It was a knitted silk neck-tie, to be accurate. But you put the
matter in a nut-shell very neatly; and I see that you diagnosed what
novelists call ‘the eternal triangle.’ And to a certain extent you
were right; only the triangle was imaginary. If you don’t mind, I will
tell you just what did happen. The gentleman who came for you was a
Mr. Fordyce, the lessee of one or two provincial theatres--I was on
the stage then; but perhaps you guessed that.”

“As a matter of fact, I did.”

“Well, Mr. Fordyce had an idea of producing a play at one of his
houses, and was going to give me a leading part. He had been to our
house once or twice to talk the matter over with Nicholas (my husband)
and me, and we were more or less friendly. He was quite a nice, sober
kind of man, and perfectly proper and respectful. On this night he had
been at the theatre where I had an engagement, and, as it was a wet
night, he drove me home in his car, and was coming in to have a few
words with us about our business. He wanted to see a photograph of me
in a particular costume, and when we arrived home I ran upstairs to
fetch it. There I found Nicholas, who had seen our arrival from the
window, and was in a state of furious jealousy. Directly I entered the
room, he locked the door and flew at me like a wild beast. As to what
followed, I think you know as much as I do, for I fainted, and when I
recovered Nicholas was sobbing in a corner, and Mr. Fordyce was
standing by the door, looking as black as thunder.”

“Had your husband been jealous of Mr. Fordyce previously?”

“Not a bit. But on this occasion he was in a very queer state. I think
he had been drinking, and taking some other things that were bad for
him----”

“Such as cocaine,” I suggested.

“Yes. But, dear me! What a very noticing person you are, Dr.
Strangeways! But you are quite right. It was the cocaine that was the
cause of the trouble. He was always a difficult man; emotional,
excitable, eccentric, and not very temperate, but after he had
acquired the drug habit he went to the bad completely. He became
slovenly, and even dirty in his person, frightfully emotional, and
gave up work of all kind, so that but for my tiny income and my small
earnings we should have starved.”

“So you actually supported him?”

“Latterly I did. And I daresay, if I had remained on the stage, we
should have done fairly well, as I was supposed to have some talent,
though I didn’t like the life. But, of course, after this affair, I
didn’t dare to live with him. He wasn’t safe. I should have been
constantly in fear of my life.”

“Had he ever been violent before?”

“Not seriously. He had often threatened horrible things, and I had
looked on his threats as mere vapourings, but this was a different
affair. I must have had a really narrow escape. So the very next day,
I went into lodgings. But that didn’t answer. He wouldn’t agree to the
separation, and was continually dogging me and making a disturbance.
In the end, I had to give up my engagement and go off, leaving no
address.”

“I suppose you went back to your people?”

“No,” she replied. “As a matter of fact, I haven’t any people. My
mother died when I was quite a child, and I lost my father when I was
about seventeen. He died on the Gold Coast, where he held an
appointment as District Commissioner.”

“Ah,” said I, “I thought you were in some way connected with West
Africa. I noticed the zodiac ring on your finger when you were signing
the agreement. When I was newly qualified I took a trip down the West
Coast as a ship’s surgeon, and bought one of those rings at Cape
Coast.”

“They are quaint little things, aren’t they?” she remarked, slipping
the ring off her finger and handing it to me. “I don’t often wear it,
though. It is rather clumsy, and it doesn’t fit very well; and I don’t
care much for rings.”

I turned the little trinket over in my hand and examined it with
reminiscent interest. It was a roughly wrought band of yellow native
gold, with the conventional signs of the zodiac worked round it in
raised figures. Inside I noticed that the letters A. C. had been
engraved.

“It was given to you before you were married, I presume,” said I, as I
returned it to her.

“Yes,” she replied, “those are the initials of my maiden
name--Angelina Carthew.” She took the ring from me, but instead of
replacing it on her finger, dropped it into a little pouch-like purse
with metal jaws, which she had taken from her pocket.

“Your position is a very disagreeable one,” said I, reverting to the
main topic. “I wonder that you haven’t applied for a judicial
separation. There are ample grounds for making the application.”

“I suppose there are. But it wouldn’t help me really, even if it were
granted. I shouldn’t get rid of him.”

“You could apply to the police if he molested you.”

“No doubt. But that doesn’t sound very restful, does it?”

“I am afraid it doesn’t. But it would be better than being constantly
molested without having any remedy or refuge.”

“Perhaps it would,” she agreed doubtfully, and then, with a faint
smile, she added: “I suppose you are wondering what on earth made me
marry him?”

“Well,” I replied, “it appears to me that his good fortune was more
remarkable than his personal attractions.”

“He wasn’t always like he is now,” said she. “I married him nearly ten
years ago, and he was fairly presentable then. His manners were quite
nice and he had certain accomplishments that rather appealed to a
young girl--I was only eighteen and rather impressionable. He was then
getting a living by writing magazine stories--love stories, they were,
of a highly emotional type--and occasional verses. They were
second-rate stuff, really, but to me he seemed a budding genius. It
was not until after we were married that the disillusionment came, and
then only gradually as his bad habits developed.”

“By the way, what do you suppose he has come down here for? What does
he want? I suppose he wishes you to go back to him?”

“I suppose he does. But, primarily, I expect he wants money. It is a
horrible position,” she added, with sudden passion. “I hate the idea
of hiding away from him when I suspect that the poor wretch has come
down to his last few shillings. After all, he is my husband; and I am
not so deadly poor now.”

“He seemed to have the wherewith to provide a fair supply of tobacco,
to say nothing of the cocaine and a ‘modest quencher’ at the tavern,”
I remarked drily. “At any rate, I hope he won’t succeed in finding out
where you live.”

“I hope not,” said she. “If he does, I shall have to move on, as I
have had to do several times already, and I don’t want to do that. I
have only been here a little over two months, and it has been very
pleasant and peaceful. But you see, Dr. Strangeways, that, if I am to
follow Mr. Japp’s advice, I shall inflict on you a very unpromising
patient. There is no medical treatment for matrimonial troubles.”

“No,” I agreed, rising and taking up my hat, “but the physical effects
may be dealt with. If I am appointed your medical advisor, I shall
send you a tonic, and if I may look in now and again to see how you
are getting on, I may be able to help you over some of your
difficulties.”

“It is very kind of you,” she said, rising and shaking my hand warmly;
and, accepting my suggestion that she had better not come to the
street door, she showed me out into the hall and dismissed me with a
smile and a little bow.

When I reached the bottom of the steps, I stood irresolutely for a few
moments and then, instead of making my way homeward, turned up the
street towards the cathedral and the bridge, walking slowly and
reflecting profoundly on the story I had just heard. It was a pitiful
story; and the quiet, restrained manner of the telling made it the
more impressive. All that was masculine in me rose in revolt against
the useless, inexcusable wrecking of this poor woman’s life. As to the
man, he was, no doubt, to be pitied for being the miserable,
degenerate wretch that he was. But he was doomed beyond any hope of
salvation. Such wretches as he are condemned in the moment of their
birth; they are born to an inheritance of misery and dishonour. But it
is infamous that in their inevitable descent into the abyss--from
which no one can save them--they should have the power to drag down
with them sane and healthy human beings who were destined by nature to
a life of happiness, of usefulness, and honour. I thought of the woman
I had just left--comely, dignified, energetic, probably even talented.
What was her future to be? So far as I could see, the upas shadow of
this drug-sodden wastrel had fallen upon her, never to be lifted until
merciful death should dissolve the ill-omened union.

This last reflection gave my thoughts a new turn. What was this man’s
purpose in pursuing her? Was he bent merely on extorting money or on
sharing her modest income? Or was there some more sinister motive? I
recalled his face; an evil, sly, vindictive face. I considered what I
knew of him; that he had undoubtedly made one attempt to murder this
woman, and that, to my knowledge, he carried about his person the
means of committing murder. For what purpose could he have provided
himself with that formidable weapon? It might be merely as a means of
coercion, or it might be as a means of revenge.

Thus meditating, I had proceeded some distance along the street when I
observed, on the opposite side, an old, three-gabled house which
looked like some kind of institution. A lamp above the doorway threw
its light on a stone tablet on which I could see an inscription of
some length, and, judging this to be an ancient almshouse, I crossed
the road to inspect it more closely. A glance at the tablet told me
that this was the famous rest-house established in the sixteenth
century by worthy Richard Watts, to give a night’s lodging and
entertainment to six poor travellers, with the express proviso that
the said travellers must be neither rogues nor proctors. I had read
through the quaint inscription and was speculating, as many others
have speculated, on the nature of Richard Watts’s grievance against
proctors as a class, when the door opened suddenly and a man rushed
out with such impetuosity that he nearly collided with me. I had moved
out of his way when he halted and addressed me excitedly.

“I say, governor, can you tell me where I can find a doctor?”

“You have found one,” I replied. “I am a doctor. What is the matter?”

“There’s a bloke in here throwing a fit,” he answered, backing into
the doorway and holding the door open for me. I entered, and followed
him down a passage to a largish, barely furnished room, where I found
four men and a woman, who looked like a hospital nurse, standing
around and watching anxiously a man who lay on the floor.

“Here’s a doctor, matron,” said my conductor, as he ushered me in.

“Well, Simmonds,” said the matron, “you haven’t wasted much time.”

“No, mum,” replied Simmonds, “I struck it lucky. Caught him just
outside.”

Meanwhile I had stepped up to the prostrate man, and at the first
glance I recognized him. He was Mrs. Frood’s husband. And, whatever he
might be “throwing,” it was not a fit--in the ordinary medical sense;
that is to say, it was not epilepsy or apoplexy; nor was it a fainting
fit of an orthodox kind. If the patient had been a woman one would
have called it a hysterical seizure, and I could give it no other
name, though I was not unmindful of the paper packet that I had seen
on that former occasion. But the emotional element was obvious. The
man purported to be insensible, and manifestly was not. The tightly
closed eyes, the everted lips--showing a row of blackened teeth--the
clutching movements of the claw-like hands--all were suggestive of at
least half-conscious simulation. I stood for a while, stooping over
him and watching him intently, and as I did so the bystanders watched
me. Then I felt his pulse, and found it, as I had expected, quick,
feeble, and irregular; and finally, producing my stethoscope, listened
to his heart with as little disturbance of his clothing as possible.

“Well, Doctor,” said the matron, “what do you think of him?”

“He is decidedly ill,” I replied. “His heart is rather jumpy, and not
very strong. Too much tobacco, I fancy, and perhaps some other things
that are not very good, and possibly insufficient food.”

“He told me, when he came in,” said the matron, “that he was
practically destitute.”

“Ah,” murmured Simmonds, “I expect he’s been blowing all his money on
Turkish baths,” whereupon the other poor travellers sniggered softly,
and were immediately extinguished by a reproving glance from the
matron.

“Do you know what brought this attack on?” I asked.

“Yes,” she replied; “he had a little dispute with Simmonds, here, and
suddenly became violently excited, and then he fell down insensible,
as you see him. It was all about nothing.”

“I jest arsked ’im,” said Simmonds, “if ’e could give me the name of
the cove what done ’is ’air, ’cos I thought I’d like to ’ave mine done
in the same fashionable style. That seemed to give ’im the fair pip.
’E jawed me something chronic, until I got shirty and told ’im if ’e
didn’t shut ’is face I’d give ’im a wipe acrost the snout. Then blow
me if ’e didn’t start to throw a fit.”

While this lucid explanation was proceeding I noticed that the patient
was evidently listening intently, though he continued to twitch his
face, exhibit his unlovely teeth, and wriggle his fingers. He was
apparently waiting for my verdict with some anxiety.

“The question is,” said the matron, “what is to be done with him? Do
you think he is in any danger?”

As she spoke, we drifted towards the door, and when we were in the
passage, out of earshot, I said:

“The best place for that man is the infirmary. There is nothing much
the matter with him but dope. He has been dosing himself with cocaine,
and he has probably got some more of the stuff about him. He is in no
danger now, but if he takes any more he may upset himself badly.”

“It is rather late to send him to the infirmary,” she said, “and I
don’t quite like to do it. Poor fellow, he seems fearfully down on his
luck, and he is quite a superior kind of man. Do you think it would be
safe for him to stay here for the night if he had a little medicine of
some kind?”

“It would be safe enough,” I replied, “if you could get possession of
his coat and waistcoat and lock them up until the morning.”

“Oh, I’ll manage that,” said she; “and about the medicine?”

“Let Simmonds walk up with me--I have taken Dr. Partridge’s
practice--and I will give it to him.”

We re-entered the supper-room and found the conditions somewhat
changed. Whether it was that the word “infirmary” had been wafted to
the patient’s attentive ears, I cannot say; but there were evident
signs of recovery. Our friend was sitting up, glaring wildly about
him, and inquiring where he was; to which questions Simmonds was
furnishing answers of a luridly inaccurate character. When I had taken
another look at the patient, and received a vacant stare of almost
aggressive unrecognition, I took possession of the facetious Simmonds,
and, having promised to look in in the morning, wished the matron
good-night and departed with my escort; who entertained me on the way
home with picturesque, unflattering, and remarkably shrewd comments on
the sufferer.

I had made up a stimulant mixture, and handed it to Simmonds when I
remembered Mrs. Frood and that Simmonds would pass her house on his
way back. For an instant, I thought of asking him to deliver her
medicine for me; and then, with quite a shock, I realized what a
hideous blunder it would have been. Evidently, the poor travellers
gave their names, and if the man, Frood, had given his correctly, the
coincidence of the names would have impressed Simmonds instantly, and
then the murder would have been out, and the fat would have been in
the fire properly. It was a narrow escape, and it made me realize how
insecure was that unfortunate lady’s position with this man lurking in
the town. And, realizing this, I determined to trust the addressed
bottle to nobody, but to leave it at the house myself. Accordingly,
having made up the medicine and wrapped it neatly in paper, I thrust
it into my pocket, and, calling out to Mrs. Dunk that I should be back
to supper in about half an hour, I set forth, and in a few minutes
arrived at the little Georgian doorway and plied the elegant brass
knocker. The door was opened--rather incautiously, I thought--by Mrs.
Frood herself.

“I am my own bottle-boy, you see, Mrs. Frood,” said I, handing her the
medicine. “I thought it safer not to send an addressed packet under
the circumstances.”

“But how good of you!” she exclaimed. “How kind and thoughtful! But
you shouldn’t have troubled about it to-night.”

“It was only a matter of five minutes’ walk,” said I, “and besides,
there was something that I thought you had better know,” and hereupon
I proceeded to give her a brief account of my recent adventures and
the condition of her precious husband. “Is he subject to attacks of
this kind?” I asked.

“Yes,” she answered. “When he is put out about anything in some ways
he is rather like a hysterical woman. But, you see, I was right. He is
penniless. And that--now I come to think of it--makes it rather odd
that he should be here. But won’t you come in for a moment?”

I entered and shut the door. “Why is it odd?” I asked.

“Because he would be getting some money to-morrow. I make him a small
allowance; it is very little, but it is as much as I can possibly
manage; and it is paid monthly, on the fifteenth of the month. But he
has to apply for it personally at the bank or send an accredited
messenger with a receipt; and as to-morrow is the fifteenth, the
question is, why on earth is he down here now? I mean that it is odd
that he should not have waited to collect the allowance before coming
to hunt me up.”

“If he is in communication with your banker,” said I, “he could, I
suppose, get a letter forwarded to you?”

“No,” she replied; “the banker who pays him is the London agent of Mr.
Japp’s banker, and he doesn’t know on whose behalf the payments are
made. I had to make that arrangement, or he would have bombarded me
with letters.”

“Well,” I said, “you had better keep close for a day or two. If his
search for you is unsuccessful, he may get discouraged and raise the
siege. I will let you know what his movements are, so far as I can.”

She thanked me once more with most evident sincerity, and as I made my
way to the door, she let me out with a cordial and friendly shake of
the hand.




 CHAPTER IV.
 DEALS WITH CHARITY AND ARCHÆOLOGY

Immediately after breakfast on the following morning I made my way
to Mr. Richard Watts’s establishment, where I learned that all the
poor travellers had departed with the exception of my patient, who had
been allowed to stay pending my report on him.

“I shall be glad to see the back of him, poor fellow,” said the
matron, “for, of course, we have no arrangements for dealing with sick
men.”

“Do you often get cases of illness here?” I asked.

“I really don’t know,” she answered. “You see, I am only doing
temporary duty here while the regular matron is away. But I should
think not, though little ailments are apt to occur in the case of a
poor man who has been on the road for a week or so.”

“This man is on tramp, is he?” said I.

“Well, no,” she replied. “It seems, from what he tells me, that his
wife has left him, and he had reason to believe that she was staying
in this town. So he came down here to try to find her. He supposed
that Rochester was a little place where everybody knew everybody else,
and that he would have no difficulty in discovering her whereabouts.
But all his inquiries have come to nothing. Nobody seems to have heard
of her. I suppose you don’t happen to know the name--Frood?”

“I only came here yesterday, myself,” was my evasive reply. “I am a
stranger to the town. But is he certain that she is here?”

“I don’t think he is. At any rate, he seems inclined to give up the
search for the present, and he is very anxious to get back to London.
But I don’t know how he is going to manage it. He isn’t fit to walk.”

“Well,” I said, “if it is only the railway fare that stands in the
way, that difficulty can be got over. I will pay for his ticket; but I
should like to be sure that he really goes.”

“Oh, I’ll see to that,” she said, with evident relief. “I will go with
him to the station, and get his ticket and see him into the train. But
you had better just have a look at him, and see that he is fit to go.”

She conducted me to the supper-room, where our friend was sitting in a
Windsor armchair, looking the very picture of misery and dejection.

“Here is the doctor come to see you, Mr. Frood,” the matron said
cheerfully, “and he is kind enough to say that, if you are well enough
to travel, he will pay your fare to London. So there’s an end of your
difficulties.”

The poor devil glanced at me for an instant, and then looked away;
and, to my intense discomfort, I saw that his eyes were filling.

“It is indeed good of you, Sir,” he murmured, shakily, but in a very
pleasant voice and with a refined accent; “most good and kind to help
a lame dog over a stile in this way. I don’t know how to thank you.”

Here, as he showed a distinct tendency to weep, I replied hastily:

“Not at all. We’ve all got to help one another in this world. And how
are you feeling? Hand is still a little bit shaky, I see.”

I put my finger on his wrist and then looked him over generally. He
was a miserable wreck, but I judged that he was as well as he was ever
likely to be.

“Well,” I said, “you are not in first-class form, but you are up to a
short railway journey. I suppose you have somewhere to go to in
London?”

“Yes,” he replied, dismally, “I have a room. It isn’t in the Albany,
but it is a shelter from the weather.”

“Never mind,” said I. “We must hope for better times. The matron is
going to see you safely to the station and comfortably settled in the
train--and”--here I handed her a ten shilling note--“you will get Mr.
Frood’s ticket, matron, and you had better give him the change. He may
want a cab when he gets to town.”

He glowered sulkily at this arrangement--I suspect he had run out of
cigarettes--but he thanked me again, and, when I had privately
ascertained the time of the train which was to bear him away, I wished
him adieu.

“I suppose,” said I, “there is no likelihood of his hopping out at
Strood to get a drink and losing the train?”

The matron smiled knowingly. “He will start from Strood,” said she. “I
shall take him over the bridge in the tram and put him into the London
express there. We don’t want him back here to-night.”

Much relieved by the good lady’s evident grasp of the situation, I
turned away up the street and began to consider my next move. I had
nothing to do this morning, for at present there was not a single
patient on my books with the exception of Mrs. Frood; and it may have
been in accordance with the prevailing belief that to persons in my
condition, an individual, familiarly known as “the old gentleman,”
obligingly functions as employment agent, that my thoughts turned to
that solitary patient. At any rate they did. Suddenly, it was borne in
on me that I ought, without delay, to convey to her the glad tidings
of her husband’s departure. Whether the necessity would have appeared
as urgent if her personal attractions had been less, I will not
presume to say; nor whether had I been more self-critical, I should
not have looked with some suspicion on this intense concern respecting
the welfare of a woman who was almost a stranger to me. As it was, it
appeared to me that I was but discharging a neighbourly duty when I
executed an insinuating rat-tat on the handsome brass knocker which
was adorned--somewhat inappropriately, under the circumstances--with
a mask of Hypnos.

After a short interval, the door was opened by a spare, middle-aged
woman of melancholic aspect, with tow-coloured hair and a somewhat
anæmic complexion, who regarded me inquiringly with a faded blue eye.

“Is Mrs. Frood at home?” I asked briskly.

“I am afraid she is not,” was the reply, uttered in a dejected tone.
“I saw her go out some time ago, and I haven’t heard her come back.
But I’ll just see, if you will come in a moment.”

I entered the hall and listened with an unaccountable feeling of
disappointment as she rapped on the door first of the front room, and
then of the back.

“She isn’t in her rooms there,” was the dispirited report, “but she
may be in the basement. I’ll call out and ask.”

She retired to the inner hall and gave utterance to a wail like that
of an afflicted sea-gull. But there was no response; and I began to
feel myself infected by her melancholy.

“I am sorry you have missed her, Sir,” said she; and then she asked:

“Are you her doctor, Sir?”

I felt myself justified in affirming that I was, whereupon she
exclaimed:

“Ah, poor thing! It is a comfort to know that she has someone to look
after her. She has been looking very sadly of late. Very sadly, she
has.”

I began to back cautiously towards the door, but she followed me up
and continued: “I am afraid she has had a deal of trouble; a deal of
trouble, poor dear. Not that she ever speaks of it to me. But I know.
I can see the lines of grief and sorrow--like a worm in the bud, so to
speak, Sir--and it makes my heart ache. It does, indeed.”

I mumbled sympathetically and continued to back towards the door.

“I don’t see very much of her,” she continued in a plaintive tone.
“She keeps herself very close. Too close, I think. You see, she does
for herself entirely. Now and again, when she asks me, which is very
seldom, I put a bit of supper in her room. That is all. And I do think
that it isn’t good for a young woman to live so solitary; and I do
hope you’ll make her take a little more change.”

“I suppose she goes out sometimes,” said I, noting that she was out at
the present moment.

“Oh, yes,” was the reply. “She goes out a good deal. But always alone.
She never has any society.”

“And what time does she usually come in?” I asked, with a view to a
later call.

“About six; or between that and seven. Then she has her supper and
puts the things out on the hall table. And that is the last I usually
see of her.”

By this time I had reached the door and softly unfastened the latch.

“If you should see her,” I said, “you might tell her that I shall look
in this evening about half-past seven.”

“Certainly, Sir,” she replied. “I shall see her at lunch-time, and I
will give her your message.”

I thanked her, and, having now got the door open, I wished her good
morning, and retreated down the steps.

As I was in the act of turning away, my eye lighted on the adjacent
bay window, appertaining to the office of Messrs. Japp and Bundy, and
I then perceived above the green curtain the upper half of a human
face, including a pair of tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles; an
apparition which informed me that Mr. Bundy had been--to use Sam
Weller’s expression--“a-twigging of me.” On catching my eye, the face
rose higher, disclosing a broad grin; whereupon, without any apparent
reason, I felt myself turning somewhat red. However, I mounted the
official steps, and, opening the office door, confronted the smiler
and his more sedate partner.

“Ha!” said the former, “you drew a blank, Doctor. I saw the lovely
Angelina go out about an hour ago. Whom did you see?”

“The lady of the house, I presume; a pale, depressed female.”

“I know,” said Bundy. “Looks like an undertaker’s widow. That’s Mrs.
Gillow. Rhymes with willow--very appropriate, too,” and he began to
chant in an absurd, Punch-like voice: “Oh, all round my hat I’ll wear
the green----”

“Be quiet, Bundy,” said Mr. Japp, regarding his partner with a wrinkly
and indulgent smile.

Bundy clapped his hand over his mouth and blew out his cheeks, and I
took the opportunity to explain: “I called on Mrs. Frood to let her
know that her husband is leaving the town.”

“Leaving the town, is he?” said Mr. Japp, elevating his eyebrows and
thereby causing his forehead to resemble a small Venetian blind. “Do
you know when?”

“He goes this morning by the ten-thirty express to London.”

“Hooray!” ejaculated Bundy, with a flourish of his arms that nearly
capsized his stool. He recovered himself with an effort, and then,
fixing his eyes on me, proceeded to whistle the opening bars of “O!
Thou that tellest good tidings to Zion!”

“That’ll do, Bundy,” said Mr. Japp. Then turning to me, he asked:
“Where did you learn these good tidings, Doctor?”

I gave them a brief account of the happenings of the previous night
and this morning’s sequel, to which they listened with deep attention.
When I had finished Mr. Japp said: “You have done a very great
kindness to my friend Mrs. Frood. It will be an immense relief to her
to know that she can walk abroad without the danger of encountering
this man. Besides, if he had stayed here he would probably have found
her out.”

“He might even have found her at home,” said Bundy, “and that would
have been worse. So I propose a vote of thanks to the doctor--with
musical honours. For-hor he’s a jolly good fell----”

“There, that’ll do, Bundy, that’ll do,” said Mr. Japp. “I never saw
such a fellow. You’ll have the neighbours complaining.”

Bundy leaned towards me confidentially and remarked in a stage
whisper, glancing at his partner: “Fidgetty old cove; regular old
kill-joy.” Then, with a sudden change of manner, he asked: “What about
that wall job, Japp? Are you going to have a look at them?”

“I can’t go at present,” said Japp. “Bulford will be coming in
presently and I must see him. Have you got anything special to do?”

“Only old Jeffson’s lease, and that can wait. Shall I trot over and
see what sort of mess they are making of things?”

“I wish you would,” said Japp; whereupon Mr. Bundy removed his
spectacles, stuck in his eye-glass, extracted from the desk his hat
and gloves which he assumed with the aid of the looking-glass, and
took his stick from the corner. Then he looked at me reflectively and
asked:

“Are you interested in archæology, Doctor?”

“Somewhat,” I replied. “Why do you ask?”

“Because we are putting some patches in the remains of the city wall.
It isn’t much to look at, and there isn’t a great deal of the original
Roman work left; but if you would care to have a look at it you might
walk up there with me.”

I agreed readily, being, as I have said, somewhat at a loose end, and
we set forth together, Bundy babbling cheerfully as we went.

“I have often thought,” said he, “that there must have been something
rather pleasant and restful about the old walled cities, particularly
after curfew when the gates were shut--that is, provided you were
inside at the time.”

“Yes,” said I. “An enclosed precinct has a certain agreeable quality
of seclusion that you can’t get in an open town or village. When I was
a student, I lived for a time in chambers in Staple Inn, and it was,
as you say, rather pleasant, when one came home at night, and the
porter had let one in at the wicket, to enter and find the gates
closed, the courts all quiet and empty, and to know that all traffic
was stopped and all strangers shut out until the morning. But it
doesn’t appear to be in accordance with modern taste, for those old
Chancery Inns have nearly all gone, and there is no tendency to
replace them with anything similar.”

“No,” Bundy agreed, stopping to look up at an old timber house, “taste
in regard to buildings, if there is any--Japp says there isn’t--has
changed completely in the last hundred years or so. Look at this alley
we are in now. Every house has got a physiognomy of its own. But when
we rebuild it, we shall fill it up with houses that will look as if
they had been bought in packets like match-boxes.”

Gossiping thus, we threaded our way through all sorts of queer little
alleys and passages. At length Bundy stopped at a wooden gate in a
high fence, and, pushing it open, motioned for me to enter; and as I
did so he drew out the key which was in the lock and put it in his
pocket.

The place which we had entered was a space of waste land, littered
with the remains of some old houses that had been demolished and
enclosed on three sides by high fences. The fourth side was formed by
a great mass of crumbling rubble, patched in places with rough masonry
and brickwork, and showing in its lower part the remains of courses of
Roman bricks. It rose to a considerable height, and was evidently of
enormous thickness, as could be seen where large areas of the face had
crumbled away, exposing great cavities, in which wall-flowers,
valerian and other rock-haunting plants, had taken up their abode. On
one of these a small gang of men were at work, and it was evident that
repairs on a considerable scale were contemplated, for there were
several large heaps of rough stone and old bricks, and in a cart-shed
in a corner of the space were a large number of barrels of lime.

As we entered, the foreman came forward to meet us, and Bundy handed
him the key from the gate.

“Better keep it in your pocket,” said he. “Mr. Japp is rather
particular about keys that he has charge of. He doesn’t like them left
in doors or gates. How are the men getting on?”

“As well as you can expect of a lot of casuals like these,” was the
reply. “There isn’t a mason or a bricklayer among them, excepting that
old chap that’s mixing the mortar. However, it’s only a rough job.”

We walked over to the part of the old wall where the men were at work,
and the appearances certainly justified the foreman’s last remark. It
was a very rough job. The method appeared to consist in building up
outside the cavity a primitive wall of unhewn stone with plenty of
mortar, and, when it had risen a foot or two, filling up the cavity
inside with loose bricks, lumps of stone, shovelfuls of liquid mortar,
and chunks of lime.

I ventured to remark that it did not look a very secure method of
building, upon which Bundy turned his eyeglass on me and smiled
knowingly.

“My dear Doctor,” said he, “you don’t appear to appreciate the
subtlety of the method. The purpose of these activities is to create
employment. That has been clearly stated by the town council. But if
you want to create employment you build a wall that will tumble down
and give somebody else the job of putting it up again.”

Here, as a man suddenly bore down on us with a bucket of mortar, Bundy
hopped back to avoid the unclean contact, and nearly sat down on a
heap of smoking lime.

“You had a narrow escape that time, mister,” remarked the old
gentleman who presided over the mortar department, as Bundy carefully
dusted his delicate shoes with his handkerchief; “that stuff would
’ave made short work of them fine clothes of yourn.”

“Would it?” said Bundy, dusting his shoes yet more carefully and
wiping the soles on the turf.

“Ah,” rejoined the old man; “terrible stuff is quicklime. Eats up
everything same as what fire does.” He rested his hands on his shovel,
and, assuming a reminiscent air, continued: “There was a pal o’ mine
what was skipper of a barge. A iron barge, she was, and he had to take
on a lading of lime from some kilns. The stuff was put aboard with a
shoot. Well, my pal, he gets ’is barge under the shoot and then ’e
goes off, leavin’ ’is mate to see the lime shot into the hold. Well,
it seems the mate had been takin’ some stuff aboard, too. Beer, or
p’raps whisky. At any rate, he’d got a skinful. Well, presently the
skipper comes back, and he sees ’em a-tippin’ the trucks of lime on to
the shoot, and he sees the barge’s hold beginning to fill, but ’e
don’t see ’is mate nowhere. He goes aboard, down to the cabin, but
there ain’t no signs of the mate there, nor yet anywheres else. Well,
they gets the barge loaded and the hatch-covers on, and everything
ready for sea; and still there ain’t no signs of the mate. So my pal,
rememberin’ that the mate--his name was Bill--rememberin’ that Bill
seemed a bit squiffy, supposed he must ’ave gone overboard. So ’e
takes on a fresh hand temporary and off ’e goes on ’is trip.

“Well, they makes their port all right and brings up alongside the
wharf, but owing to a strike among the transport men they can’t unload
for about three weeks. However, when the strike is over, they rigs a
whip and a basket and begins to get the stuff out. All goes well until
they get down to the bottom tier. Then one of the men brings up a bone
on his shovel. ‘Hallo!’ says the skipper, ‘what’s bones a-doin’ in a
cargo of fresh lime?’ He rakes over the stuff on the floor and up
comes a skull with a hole in the top of it. ‘Why, blow me,’ says the
skipper, ‘if that don’t look like Bill. He warn’t as thin in the face
as all that, but I seem to know them teeth.’ Just then one of the men
finds a clay pipe--a nigger’s head, it was--and the skipper
reckernizes it at once. ‘That there’s Bill’s pipe,’ sez he, ‘and them
bones is Bill’s bones,’ ’e sez. And so they were. They found ’is
belt-buckle and ’is knife, and ’is trouser buttons and the nails out
of ’is boots. And that’s all there was left of Bill. He must have
tumbled down into the hold and cracked his nut, and then the first
truckful of lime must ’ave covered ’im up. So, if you sets any value
on them ’andsome shoes o’ yourn, don’t you go a-treadin’ in quick
lime.”

Bundy looked down anxiously at his shoes, and, having given them an
additional wipe, he moved away from the dangerous neighbourhood of the
lime and we went together to examine the ancient wall.

“That was rather a tall yarn of the old man’s,” remarked Bundy. “Is it
a fact that lime is as corrosive as he made out?”

“I don’t really know very much about it,” I replied. “There is a
general belief that it will consume almost anything but metal. How
true that is I can’t say, but I remember that at the Crippen trial one
of the medical experts--I think it was Pepper--said that if the body
had been buried in quicklime it would have been entirely
consumed--excepting the bones, of course. But it is difficult to
believe that a body could disappear completely in three weeks, or
thereabouts, as our friend said. How fine this old wall looks with
those clumps of valerian and wallflowers growing on it! I suppose it
encircled the town completely at one time?”

“Yes,” he replied, “and it is a pity there isn’t more of it left, or
at least one or two of the gateways. A city gate is such a magnificent
adornment. Think of the gates of Canterbury and Rye, and especially at
Sandwich, where you actually enter the town through the barbican; and
think of what Rochester must have been before all the gates were
pulled down. But you must hear Japp on the subject. He’s a regular
architectural Jeremiah. By the way, what did you think of Mrs. Frood?
You saw her last night, didn’t you?”

“Yes. I was rather taken with her. She is very nice and friendly and
unaffected, and good-looking, too. I thought her distinctly handsome.”

“She isn’t bad-looking,” Bundy admitted. “But I can’t stand her voice.
It gets on my nerves. I hate a squeaky voice.”

“I shouldn’t call it squeaky,” said I. “It is a high voice, and rather
sing-song; and it isn’t, somehow, quite in keeping with her appearance
and manner.”

“No,” said Bundy, “that’s what it is. She’s too big for a voice like
that.”

I laughed at the quaint expression. “People’s voices,” said I, “are
not like steamers’ whistles, graduated in pitch according to their
tonnage. Besides, Mrs. Frood is not such a very big woman.”

“She is a good size,” said he. “I should call her rather tall. At any
rate, she is taller than I am. But I suppose you will say that she
might be that without competing with the late Mrs. Bates.”

“Comparisons between the heights of men and women,” I said cautiously,
“are rather misleading,” and here I changed the subject, though I
judged that Bundy was not sensitive in regard to his stature, for
while he was cleaning the lime from his shoes I had noticed that he
wore unusually low heels. Nor need he have been, for though on a small
scale, he was quite an important-looking person.

“Don’t you think,” he asked, after a pause, “that it is rather queer
that the man Frood should have gone off so soon? He only came down
yesterday, and he can’t have made much of a search for Madame.”

“The queer thing is that he should have come down on that particular
day,” I replied. “It seems that he draws a monthly allowance on the
fifteenth. That was what made him so anxious to get back; but it is
odd that he didn’t put off his visit here until he had collected the
money.”

“If he had run his wife to earth, he could have collected it from
her,” said Bundy. “I wonder how he found out that she was here.”

“He evidently hadn’t very exact information,” I said, “nor did he seem
quite certain that she really was here. And his failure to get any
news of her appears to have discouraged him considerably. It is just
possible that he has gone back to get more precise information if he
can, when he has drawn his allowance.”

“That is very likely,” Bundy agreed; “and it is probable that we
haven’t seen the last of him yet.”

“I have a strong suspicion that we haven’t,” said I. “If he is sure
she is here, and can get enough money together to come and spend a
week here, he will be pretty certain to discover her whereabouts. It
is a dreadful position for her. She ought to get a judicial
separation.”

“I doubt if she could,” said he. “You may be sure he would contest
that application pretty strongly, and what case would she have in
support of it? He is an unclean blighter; he doesn’t work; he smokes
and drinks too much, and you say he takes drugs. But he doesn’t seem
to be violent or dangerous or threatening, or to be on questionable
terms with other women--at least, I have never heard anything to that
effect. Have you?”

“No,” I answered-- I had said nothing to him or Japp about the London
incident. “He seems to have married the only woman in the world who
would look at him.”

Bundy grinned. “An unkind cut, that, Doctor,” said he; “but I believe
you’re right. And here we are, back at the official premises. Are you
coming in?”

I declined the invitation, and as he skipped up the steps I turned my
face homewards.




 CHAPTER V.
 JOHN THORNDYKE

The sexual preferences or affinities of men and women have always
impressed me as very mysterious and inexplicable. I am referring to
the selective choice of individuals, not to the general attraction of
the sexes for one another. Why should a particular pair of human
beings single one another out from the mass of their fellows as
preferable to all others? Why to one particular man does one
particular woman and no other become the exciting cause of the emotion
of love? It is not a matter of mere physical beauty or mental
excellence, for if it were men and women would be simply classifiable
into the attractive and the non-attractive; whereas we find in
practice that a woman who may be to the majority of men an object of
indifference, is to some one man an object of passionate love; and
vice-versa. Nor is love necessarily accompanied by any delusions as to
the worth of its object, for it will persist in spite of the clear
recognition of personal defects and in conscious conflict with
judgment and reason.

The above reflections, with others equally profound, occupied my mind
as I sat on a rather uncomfortable little rush-seated chair in the
nave of Rochester Cathedral; whither I had proceeded in obedience to
orders from Mrs. Dunk, to attend the choral afternoon service; and
they were occasioned by the sudden recognition--not without
surprise--of the very deep impression that had been made on me by my
patient, Mrs. Frood. For the intensity of that impression I could not
satisfactorily account. It is true that her circumstances were
interesting and provocative of sympathy. But that was no reason for
the haunting of my thoughts by her, of which I was conscious. She was
not a really beautiful woman, though I thought her more than commonly
good-looking; and she had evidently made no particular impression on
Bundy. Yet, though I had seen her but three times, including my first
meeting with her a year ago, I had to recognize that she had hardly
been out of my thoughts since, and I was aware of looking forward with
ridiculous expectancy to my proposed visit to her this evening.

Thus, speculations on the meaning of this preoccupation mingled
themselves with other speculations, as, for instance, on the abrupt
changes of intention suggested by half of an Early English arch
clapped up against a Norman pier; and as my thoughts rambled on,
undisturbed by a pleasant voice, intoning with soothing
unintelligibility somewhere beyond the stone screen, I watched with
languid curiosity the strangers who entered and stole on tip-toe to
the nearest vacant chair. Presently, however, as the intoning voice
gave place to the deep, pervading hum of the organ, a visitor entered
who instantly attracted my attention.

He was obviously a personage--a real personage; not one of those who
have achieved greatness by the free use of their elbows, or have had
it thrust upon them by influential friends. This was an unmistakable
thoroughbred. He was a tall man, very erect and dignified in carriage,
and in spite of his iron-grey hair, evidently strong, active, and
athletic. But it was his face that specially riveted my attention: not
merely by reason that it was a handsome, symmetrical face, inclining
to the Greek type, with level brows, a fine, straight nose, and a
shapely mouth, but rather on account of its suggestion of commanding
strength and intelligence. It was a strangely calm--even
immobile--face; but yet it conveyed a feeling of attentiveness and
concentration, and especially of power.

I watched the stranger curiously as he stepped quietly to a seat not
far from me, noting how he seemed to stand out from the ordinary men
who surrounded him, and wondering who he was. But I was not left to
wonder very long. A few moments later another visitor arrived, but not
a stranger this time; for in this newcomer I recognized an old
acquaintance, a Dr. Jervis, whom I had known when I was a student and
when he had taken temporary charge of my uncle’s practice. Since then,
as I had learned, he had qualified as a barrister and specialized in
legal medicine as the coadjutor of the famous medical jurist, Dr. John
Thorndyke.

For a few moments Jervis stood near the entrance looking about the
nave, as if in search of someone. Then, suddenly, his eye lighted on
the distinguished stranger, and he walked straight over to him and sat
down by his side; from which, and from the smile of recognition with
which he was greeted, I inferred that the stranger was none other than
Dr. Thorndyke himself.

Jervis had apparently not seen, or at least not recognized me, but, as
I observed that there was a vacant chair by his side, I determined to
renew our acquaintance and secure, if possible, a presentation to his
eminent colleague. Accordingly, I crossed the nave, and, taking the
vacant chair, introduced myself, and was greeted with a cordial
hand-shake.

The circumstances did not admit of conversation, but presently, when
the anthem appeared to be drawing to a close, Jervis glanced at his
watch and whispered to me: “I want to hear all your news, Strangeways,
and to introduce you to Thorndyke; and we must get some tea before we
go to the station. Shall we clear out now?”

As I assented he whispered to Thorndyke, and we all rose and filed
silently towards the door, our exit covered by the concluding strains
of the anthem. As soon as we were outside Jervis presented me to his
colleague, and suggested an immediate adjournment to some place of
refreshment. I proposed that they should come and have tea with me,
but Jervis replied: “I’m afraid we haven’t time to-day. There is a
very comfortable teashop close to the Jasperian gate-house. You had
better come there and then perhaps you can walk to the station with
us.”

We adopted this plan, and when we had established ourselves on a
settle by the window of the ancient, low-ceiled room and given our
orders to a young lady in a becoming brown costume, Jervis proceeded
to interrogate.

“And what might you be doing in Rochester, Strangeways?”

“Nominally,” I replied, “I am engaged in medical practice. Actually, I
am a gentleman at large. I have taken a death vacancy here, and I
arrived yesterday morning.”

“Any patients?” he inquired.

“Two at present,” I answered. “One I brought down with me and returned
empty this morning. The other is his wife.”

“Ha,” said Jervis, “a concise statement, but obscure. It seems to
require amplification.”

I accordingly proceeded to amplify, describing in detail my journey
from town and my subsequent dealings with my fellow-traveller. The
circumstances of Mrs. Frood, being matters of professional confidence,
I was at first disposed to suppress; but then, reflecting that my two
friends were in a position to give expert opinions and advice, I put
them in possession of all the facts that were known to me, excepting
the Regent’s Park incident, which I felt hardly at liberty to
disclose.

“Well,” said Jervis, when I had finished, “if the rest of your
practice develops on similar lines, we shall have to set up a branch
establishment in your neighbourhood. There are all sorts of
possibilities in this case. Don’t you think so, Thorndyke?”

“I should hardly say ‘all sorts,’” was the reply. “The possibilities
seem to me to be principally of one sort; extremely disagreeable for
the poor lady. She has the alternatives of allowing herself to be
associated with this man--which seems to be impossible--or of spending
the remainder of her life in a perpetual effort to escape from him;
which is an appalling prospect for a young woman.”

“Yes,” agreed Jervis, “it is bad enough. But there seems to me worse
possibilities with a fellow of this kind; a drinking, drug-swallowing,
hysterical degenerate. You never know what a man of that type will
do.”

“You always hope that he will commit suicide,” said Thorndyke; “and to
do him justice, he does, fairly often show that much perception of his
proper place in nature. But, as you say, the actions of a mentally and
morally abnormal man are incalculable. He may kill himself or he may
kill somebody else, or he may join with other abnormals to commit
incomprehensible and apparently motiveless political crimes. But we
will hope that Mr. Frood will limit his activities to sponging on his
wife.”

The conversation now turned from my affairs to those of my friends,
and I ventured to inquire what had brought them to Rochester.

“We came down,” said Jervis, “to watch an inquest for one of our
insurance clients. But after all it has had to be adjourned for a
fortnight. So we may have the pleasure of seeing you again.”

“We won’t leave it to chance,” said I. “Let us settle that you come to
lunch with me, if that will be convenient. You can fix your own time.”

My two friends consulted, and, having referred to their time-table,
accepted the invitation for one o’clock on that day fortnight; and
when I had “booked the appointment,” we finished our tea and sallied
forth, making our way over the bridge to Strood Station, at the main
entrance to which I wished them adieu.

As I turned away from the station and sauntered slowly along the shore
before recrossing the bridge, I recalled the conversation of my two
colleagues with a certain vague discomfort. To both of them, it was
evident, the relations of my fair patient and her husband presented
sinister possibilities, although I had not informed them of the actual
murderous attack; and though the more cautious reticent Thorndyke had
seemed to minimize them, his remarks had expressed what was already in
my own mind, accentuated by what I knew. These nervy, abnormal men are
never safe to deal with. Their unstable emotions may be upset in a
moment and then no one can tell what will happen. It was quite
possible that Frood had come to Rochester with the perfectly peaceable
intention of inducing his wife to return to him. But this was far from
certain, and I shuddered to think of what might follow a refusal on
her part. I did not like that knife. I have a sane man’s dislike of
lethal weapons of all kinds; but especially do I dislike them in the
hands of those whose self-control is liable to break down suddenly.

It was true that this man had not succeeded in finding his wife, and
even seemed to have given up the search. But I felt pretty certain
that he had not. Somehow, he had discovered that she was in the town,
and from the same source he might get further information; and, in any
case, I felt no doubt that he would renew the pursuit, and that, in
the end, he would find her. And then--but at this point I found myself
opposite the house and observed Mrs. Gillow standing on the doorstep,
fumbling in her pocket for the latch-key. She had just extracted it,
and was in the act of inserting it into the latch when I crossed the
road and made my presence known. She greeted me with a wan smile as I
ascended the steps, and, having by this time got the door open,
admitted me to the hall.

“I gave Mrs. Frood your message at lunch-time, sir,” said she, in a
depressed tone, “and I believe she has come in.” Here, having closed
the street door, she rapped softly with her knuckles at that of the
front room, whereupon the voice to which Bundy objected so much called
out: “Come in, Mrs. Gillow.”

The latter threw the door open. “It is the doctor, Madam,” said she;
and on this announcement, I walked in.

“I didn’t hear you knock,” said Mrs. Frood, rising, and holding out
her hand.

“I didn’t knock,” I replied. “I sneaked in under cover of Mrs.
Gillow.”

“That was very secret and cautious of you,” said she. “You make me
feel like a sort of feminine Prince Charlie, lying perdu in the
robbers’ cavern; whereas, I have actually been taking my walks abroad
and brazenly looking in the shop windows. But I have kept a sharp
lookout, all the same.”

“There really wasn’t any need,” said I. “The siege is raised.”

“You don’t mean that my husband has gone?” she exclaimed.

“I do, indeed,” I answered; and I gave her a brief account of the
events of the morning, suppressing my unofficial part in the
transaction.

“Do you think,” she asked, “that the matron paid his fare out of her
own pocket?”

“I am sure she didn’t,” I answered hastily. “She touched some local
altruist for the amount; it was only a few shillings, you know.”

“Still,” she said, “I feel that I ought to refund those few shillings.
They were really expended for my benefit.”

“Well, you can’t,” I said with some emphasis. “You couldn’t do it
without disclosing your identity, and then you would have some
philanthropist trying to effect a reconciliation. Your cue is to keep
yourself to yourself for the present.”

“For the present!” she echoed. “It seems to me that I have got to be a
fugitive for the rest of my natural life. It is a horrible position,
to have to live in a state of perpetual concealment, like a criminal,
and never dare to make an acquaintance.”

“Don’t you know anyone in Rochester?” I asked.

“Not a soul,” she replied, “excepting Mr. Japp, who is a relative by
marriage--he was my aunt’s brother-in-law--his partner, and Mrs.
Gillow and you. And you all know my position.”

“Does Mrs. Gillow know the state of affairs?” I asked in some
surprise.

“Yes,” she answered, “I thought it best to tell her, in confidence, so
that she should understand that I want to live a quiet life.”

“I suppose you haven’t cut yourself off completely from all your
friends?” said I.

“Very nearly. I haven’t many friends that I really care about much,
but I keep in touch with one or two of my old comrades. But I have had
to swear them to secrecy--though it looks as if the secret had leaked
out in some way. Of course they all know Nicholas--my husband.”

“And I suppose you have been able to learn from them how your husband
views the separation?”

“Yes. Of course he thinks I have treated him abominably, and he
evidently suspects that I have some motive for leaving him other than
mere dislike of his unpleasant habits. The usual motive, in fact.”

“What Sam Weller would call a ‘priory attachment’?” I suggested.

“Yes. He is a jealous and suspicious man by nature. I had quite a lot
of trouble with him in that way before that final outbreak, though I
have always been most circumspect in my relations with other men.
Still, a woman doesn’t complain of a little jealousy. Within reason,
it is a natural, masculine failing.”

“I should consider a tendency to use a knitted silk necktie for
purposes which I need not specify as going rather beyond ordinary
masculine failings,” I remarked drily; on which she laughed and
admitted that perhaps it was so. There was a short pause; then,
turning to a fresh subject, she asked:

“Do you think you will get any of Dr. Partridge’s practice?”

“I suspect not, or at any rate very little; and that reminds me that I
have not yet inquired as to my patient’s condition. Are you any
better?”

As I asked the question, I looked at her attentively, and noted that
she was still rather pale and haggard, so far as I could judge by the
subdued light of the shaded lamp, and that the darkness under the eyes
remained undiminished.

“I am afraid I am not doing you much credit,” she replied, with a
faint smile. “But you can’t expect any improvement while these
unsettled conditions exist. If you could induce my respected husband
to elope with another woman you would effect an immediate cure.”

“I am afraid,” said I, “that is beyond my powers, to say nothing of
the inhumanity to the other woman. But we must persevere. You must let
me look in on you from time to time, just to keep an eye on you.”

“I hope you will,” she replied, energetically. “If it doesn’t weary
you to listen to my complaints and gossip a little, please keep me on
your visiting list. With the exception of Mr. Japp, you are the only
human creature that I hold converse with. Mrs. Gillow is a dear, good
creature, but instinct warns me not to get on conversational terms
with her. She’s rather lonely, too.”

“Yes; you might find it difficult to turn the tap off. I am always
very cautious with housekeepers and landladies.”

She darted a mischievous glance at me. “Even if your landlady happens
to be your patient?” she asked.

I chuckled as I remembered our dual relationship. “That,” said I, “is
an exceptional case. The landlady becomes merged in the patient, and
the patient tends to become a friend.”

“The doctor,” she retorted, “tends very strongly to become a friend,
and a very kind and helpful friend. I think you have been exceedingly
good to me--a mere waif who has drifted across your horizon.”

“Well,” I said, “if you think so, far be it from me to contradict you.
One may as well pick up gratefully a stray crumb of commendation that
one doesn’t deserve to set off against the deserved credit that one
doesn’t get. But I should like to think that all my good deeds in the
future will be as agreeable in the doing.”

She gave me a prim little smile. “We are getting monstrously polite,”
she remarked, upon which we both laughed.

“However,” said I, “the moral of it all is that you ought to have a
friendly medical eye kept on you, and, as mine is the eye that happens
to be available, and as you are kind enough to accept the optical
supervision, I shall give myself the pleasure of looking in on you
from time to time to see how you are and to hear how the world wags.
What is the best time to find you at home?”

“I am nearly always at home after seven o’clock, but perhaps that is
not very convenient for you. I don’t know how you manage your
practice.”

“The fact is,” said I, “that at present you are my practice, so I
shall adapt my visiting round to your circumstances, and make my call
at, or after, seven. I suppose you get some exercise?”

“Oh, yes. Quite a lot. I walk out in the country, and wander about
Chatham and Gillingham and out to Frindsbury. I have been along the
Watling Street as far as Cobham. Rochester itself I rather avoid for
fear of making acquaintances, though it is a pleasant old town in
spite of the improvements.”

As she spoke of these solitary rambles the idea floated into my mind
that, later on, I might perchance offer to diminish their solitude.
But I quickly dismissed it. Her position was, in any case, one of some
delicacy--that of a young woman living apart from her husband. It
would be an act the very reverse of friendly to compromise her in any
way; nor would it tend at all to my own professional credit. A
doctor’s reputation is nearly as tender as a woman’s.

Our conversation had occupied nearly three quarters of an hour, and,
although I would willingly have lingered, it appeared to me that I had
made as long a visit as was permissible. I accordingly rose, and,
having given a few words of somewhat perfunctory professional advice,
shook hands with my patient and let myself out.




 CHAPTER VI.
 THE SHADOWS DEEPEN

The coming events, whose premonitory shadows had been falling upon
me unnoted since I came to Rochester, were daily drawing nearer.
Perhaps it may have been that the deepening shadows began dimly to
make themselves felt; that some indistinct sense of instability and
insecurity had begun to steal into my consciousness. It may have been
so. But, nevertheless, looking back, I can see that when the
catastrophe burst upon me it found me all unsuspicious and unprepared.

Nearly a fortnight had passed since my meeting with my two friends in
the Cathedral, and I was looking forward with some eagerness to their
impending visit. During that fortnight little seemed to have happened,
though the trivial daily occurrences were beginning to acquire a
cumulative significance not entirely unperceived by me. My promise to
Mrs. Frood had been carried out very thoroughly: for at least every
alternate evening had found me seated by the little table with the
red-shaded lamp, making the best pretence I could of being there in a
professional capacity.

It was unquestionably indiscreet. The instant liking that I had taken
to this woman should have warned me that here was one of those
unaccountable “affinities” that are charged with such immense
potentialities of blessing or disaster. The first impression should
have made it clear to me that I could not safely spend much time in
her society. But unfortunately the very circumstance that should have
warned me to keep away was the magnet that drew me to her side.

However, there was one consoling fact: if the indiscretion was mine,
so by me alone were the consequences supported. Our relations were of
the most unexceptionable kind; indeed, she was not the sort of woman
with whom any man would have taken a liberty. As to my feelings
towards her, I could not pretend to deceive myself, but similarly, I
had no delusions as to her feelings towards me. She welcomed my visits
with that frank simplicity that is delightful to a friend and hopeless
to a lover. It was plain to me that the bare possibility of anything
beyond straightforward, honest friendship never entered her head. But
this very innocence and purity, while at once a rebuke and a
reassurance, but riveted my fetters the more firmly.

Such as our friendship was (and disregarding the secret reservation on
my side), it grew apace; indeed, it sprang into existence at our first
meeting. There was between us that ease and absence of reserve that
distinguishes the intercourse of those who like and understand one
another. I never had any fear of unwittingly giving offence. In our
long talks and discussions, we had no need of choosing our words or
phrases or of making allowances for possible prejudices. We could say
plainly what we meant with the perfect assurance that it would be
neither misunderstood nor resented. In short, if my feelings towards
her could only have been kept at the same level as hers towards me,
our friendship would have been perfect.

In the course of these long and pleasant gossiping visits, I observed
my patient somewhat closely, and, quite apart from the personal
affinity, I became more and more favourably impressed. She was a
clever woman, quick and alert in mind, and evidently well informed.
She seemed to be kindly, and was certainly amiable and even-tempered,
though not in the least weak or deficient in character. Probably, in
happier circumstances, she would have been more gay and vivacious,
for, though she was habitually rather grave and even sombre, there
were occasional flashes of wit that suggested a naturally lively
temperament.

As to her appearance--to repeat in more detail what I have already
said--she was a rather large woman, very erect and somewhat stately in
bearing; distinctly good-looking (though of this I was not, perhaps, a
very good judge). Her features were regular, but not in any way
striking. Her expression was, as I have said, a little sombre and
severe, the mouth firmly set and slightly depressed at the corners,
the eyebrows black, straight, and unusually well-marked and nearly
meeting above the nose. She had an abundance of black, or nearly
black, hair, parted low on the forehead and drawn back loosely,
covering the ears and temples, and she wore a largish coil nearly on
the top of the head; a formal, matronly style that accentuated the
gravity of her expression.

Such was Angelina Frood as I looked on her in those
never-to-be-forgotten evenings; as she rises before the eyes of memory
as I write, and as she will remain in my recollection so long as I
live.

In this fortnight one really arresting incident had occurred. It was
just a week after my meeting with Dr. Thorndyke, when, returning from
a walk along the London Road as far as Gad’s Hill, I stopped on
Rochester Bridge to watch a barge which had just passed under, and was
rehoisting her lowered mast. As I was leaning on the parapet, a man
brushed past me, and I turned my head idly to look at him. Then, in an
instant, I started up; for though the man’s back was towards me, there
was something unmistakably familiar in the gaunt figure, the seedy
clothes, the great cloth cap, the shock of mouse-coloured hair, and
the thick oaken stick that he swung in his hand. But I was not going
to leave myself in any doubt on the subject. Cautiously I began to
retrace my steps, keeping him in view but avoiding overtaking him,
until he reached the western end of the bridge, when he halted and
looked back. Then any possible doubt was set at rest. The man was
Nicholas Frood. I don’t know whether he saw me; he made no sign of
recognition; and when he turned and walked on, I continued to follow,
determined to make sure of his destination.

As I had hoped and expected, he took the road to the right, leading to
the river bank and the station. Still following him, I noted that he
walked at a fairly brisk pace and seemed to have recovered completely
from his debility--if that debility had not been entirely counterfeit.
Opposite the pier he turned into the station approach, and when from
the corner I had watched him enter the station, I gave up the pursuit,
assuming that he was returning to London.

But how long had he been in Rochester? What had he been doing, and
what success had he had in his search? These were the questions that I
asked myself as I walked back over the bridge. Probably he had come
down for the day; and since he was returning, it was reasonable to
infer that he had had no luck. As I entered the town and glanced up at
the great clock that hangs out across the street from the Corn
Exchange, like a sort of horological warming-pan, I saw that it was
close upon eight. It was a good deal after my usual time for calling
on Mrs. Frood, but the circumstances were exceptional and I felt that
it was necessary to ascertain whether anything untoward had occurred.
I was still debating what I should do when, as I came opposite the
house, I saw Mrs. Gillow coming out of the door. Immediately I crossed
the road and accosted her.

“Have you seen Mrs. Frood this evening, Mrs. Gillow?” I asked, after
passing the usual compliments.

“Yes, sir,” was the reply. “I left her only a few minutes ago working
at one of the drawings that she does for Mr. Japp. She seems better
this evening--brighter and more cheerful. I think your visits have
done her good, sir. It is a lonely life for a young woman--having no
one to talk to all through the long evenings. I’m always glad to hear
your knock, and so, I think, is she.”

“I’m pleased to hear you say so, Mrs. Gillow,” said I. “However, as it
is rather late, and she has something to occupy her, I don’t think I
will call this evening.”

With this I took my leave and went on my way in better spirits.
Evidently all was well so far. Nevertheless, the reappearance of this
man was an uncomfortable incident. It was clear that he had not given
up the pursuit, and, seeing that Rochester was only some thirty miles
from London, it would be quite easy for him to make periodical
descents on the place to continue the search. There was no denying
that Mrs. Frood’s position was extremely insecure, and I could think
of no plan for making it less so, excepting that of leaving Rochester,
for a time at least, a solution which ought to have commended itself
to me, but did not.

Perhaps it was this fact that decided me not to say anything about the
incident. The obvious thing was to have told her and put her on her
guard. But I persuaded myself that it would only make her anxious to
no purpose; that she could not prevent him from coming nor could she
take any further measures for concealment. And then there was the
possibility that he might never come again.

So far as I know, he never did. During the rest of the week I
perambulated the town hour after hour, looking into the shops,
scanning the faces of the wayfarers in the streets and even visiting
the stations at the times when the London trains were due; but never a
glimpse did I catch of that ill-omened figure.

And all the time, the shadows were deepening, and that which cast them
was drawing nearer.

It was nearly a week after my meeting with Nicholas Frood that an
event befell at which I looked askance at the time and which was, as
it turned out, the opening scene of a new act. It was on the Saturday.
I am able to fix the date by an incident, trivial enough in itself,
but important by reason of its forming thus a definite point of
departure. My visitors were due on the following Monday, and it had
occurred to me that I had better lay in a little stock of wine; and as
Mr. Japp was an old resident who knew everybody in the town, I decided
to consult him as to the choice of a wine merchant.

It was a little past mid-day when I arrived at the office, and as I
entered I observed that some kind of conference was in progress. A
man, whom I recognized as the foreman of the gang who were working on
the old wall, was standing sheepishly with his knuckles resting on the
table; Bundy had swung round on his stool and was glaring owlishly
through his great spectacles, while Mr. Japp was sitting bolt upright,
his forehead in a state of extreme corrugation and his eyes fixed
severely on the foreman.

“I suppose,” said Bundy, “you left it in the gate?”

“I expect Evans did,” replied the foreman. “You see, I had to call in
at the office, so I gave the key to Evans and told him to go on with
the other men and let them in. When I got there the gate was open and
the men were at work, and I forgot all about the key until it was time
to come away and lock up. Then I asked Evans for it, and he said he’d
left it in the gate. But when I went to look for it it wasn’t there.
Someone must have took it out.”

“Doesn’t seem very likely,” said Bundy. “However, I suppose it will
turn up. It had one of our wooden labels tied to it. Shall I give him
the duplicate to lock up the place?”

“You must, I suppose,” said Japp; “but it must be brought straight
back and given to me. You understand, Smith? Bring it back at once,
and deliver it to me or to Mr. Bundy. And look here, Smith. I shall
offer ten shillings reward for that key; and if it is brought back and
I have to pay the reward you will have to make it up among you. You
understand that?”

Smith indicated grumpily that he understood; and when Bundy had handed
him the duplicate key, he took his departure in dudgeon.

When he had gone I stated my business, and Bundy pricked up his ears.

“Wine, hey?” said he, removing his spectacles and assuming his
eyeglass. “Tucker will be the man for him, won’t he, Japp? Very
superior wine merchant is Tucker. Old and crusted; round and soft;
rare and curious. I’d better pop round with him and introduce him,
hadn’t I? You’ll want to taste a few samples, I presume, Doctor?”

“I’m not giving a wholesale order,” said I, smiling at his enthusiasm.
“A dozen or so of claret and one or two bottles of port is all I
want.”

“Still,” said Bundy, “you want to know what the stuff’s like. Not
going to buy a pig in a poke. You’ll have to taste it, of course. I’ll
help you. Two heads are better than one. Come on. You said Tucker,
didn’t you, Japp?”

“As a matter of fact,” said Japp, wrinkling his face up into an
appreciative smile, “I didn’t say anything. But Tucker will do; only
he won’t let you taste anything until you have bought it.”

“Won’t he!” said Bundy. “We shall see. Come along, Doctor.”

He dragged me out of the office and down the steps, and we set forth
towards the bridge; but we had not walked more than a couple of
hundred yards when he suddenly shot up a narrow alley and beckoned to
me mysteriously. I followed him up the alley, and as he halted I
asked:

“What have you come here for?”

“I want you,” he replied impressively, “to take a look at this wall.”

I scrutinized the wall with minute attention but failed to discover
any noteworthy peculiarities in it.

“Well,” I said, at length, “I don’t see anything unusual about this
wall.”

“Neither do I,” he replied, looking furtively down the alley.

“Then, what the deuce--” I began.

“It’s all right,” said he. “She’s gone. That damsel in the pink hat. I
just popped up here to let her pass. The fact is,” he explained, as he
emerged cautiously into the High Street, glancing up and down like an
Indian on the war-path, “these women are the plague of my life; always
trying to hook me for teas or bazaars or garden fêtes or some sort of
confounded foolishness; and that pink-hatted lady is a regular
sleuth-hound.”

We walked quickly along the narrow pavement, Bundy looking about him
warily, until we reached the wine-merchant’s premises, into which my
companion dived like a harlequin and forthwith proceeded to introduce
me and my requirements. Mr. Tucker was a small, elderly man; old and
crusted and as dry as his own Amontillado; but he was not proof
against Bundy’s blandishments. Before I had had time to utter a
protest, I found myself in a dark cavern at the rear of the shop,
watching Mr. Tucker fill a couple of glasses from a mouldy-looking
cask.

“Ha!” said Bundy, sipping the wine with a judicial air. “H’m. Yes. Not
so bad. Slightly corked, perhaps.”

“Corked!” exclaimed Tucker, staring at Bundy in amazement. “How can it
be corked when it is just out of the cask?”

“Well, bunged, then,” Bundy corrected.

“I never heard of wine being bunged,” said Tucker. “There’s no such
thing.”

“Isn’t there? Well, then, it can’t be. Must be my fancy. What do you
think of it, Doctor?”

“It seems quite a sound claret,” said I, inwardly wishing my volatile
friend at the devil, for I felt compelled, by way of soothing the wine
merchant’s wounded feelings, to order twice the quantity that I had
intended. We had just completed the transaction, and were crossing the
outer shop when the doorway became occluded by two female figures, and
Bundy uttered a half-suppressed groan. I drew aside to make way for
the newcomers--two ladies whom polite persons would have described as
middle-aged, on the assumption that they contemplated a somewhat
extreme degree of longevity--and I was aware that Bundy was
endeavouring to take cover behind me. But it was of no use. One of
them espied him instantly and announced her discovery with a little
squeak of ecstasy.

“Why, it’s Mr. Bundy. I do declare! Now, where _have_ you been all
this long time? It’s ages and ages and ages since you came to see us,
isn’t it, Martha? Let me see, now, when was it?” She fixed a
reflective eye on her companion, while Bundy smiled a sickly smile and
glanced wistfully at the open door.

“I know,” she exclaimed, triumphantly. “It was when we had the
feeble-minded children to tea, and Mr. Blote showed them the gold fish
trick--at least he tried to, but the glass bowl stuck in the bag under
his coat-tails and wouldn’t come out; and when he tried to pull it out
it broke----”

“I think you are mistaken, Marian,” the other lady interrupted. “It
wasn’t the feeble-minded tea. It was after that, when we helped the
Jewbury-Browns to get up that rumble sale----”

“Jumble sale, you mean, dear,” her companion corrected.

“I mean rummage sale,” the lady called Martha insisted, severely. “If
you will try to recall the circumstances, you will remember that the
jumble sale took place after----”

“Not after,” the other lady corrected. “It was before--several days
before, I should say, speaking from a somewhat imperfect memory. If
you will try to recollect, Martha, dear----”

“I recollect quite distinctly,” the lady called Martha interposed, a
little haughtily. “There was the feeble-minded tea--that was on a
Tuesday--or was it a Thursday--no, it was a Tuesday, or at
least--well, at any rate, it was some days before the jum--rum----”

“Not at all,” the other lady dissented emphatically.

At this point, catching the eye of the lady called Marian, I crept by
slow degrees out on the threshold and turned an expectant eye on
Bundy. The rather broad hint took immediate effect, for the lady said
to her companion: “I am afraid, Martha, dear, you are detaining Mr.
Bundy and his friend. _Good_-bye, Mr. Bundy. Shall we see you next
Friday evening? We are giving a little entertainment to the
barge-boys. We are inviting them to come and bring their mouth-organs
and get up a little informal concert. _Do_ come if you can. We shall
be _so_ delighted. _Good_-bye.”

Bundy shook hands effusively with the two ladies and darted out after
me, seizing my arm and hurrying me along the pavement.

“Bit of luck for me, Doctor, having you with me. If I had been alone
and unprotected I shouldn’t have escaped for half-an-hour; and I
should have been definitely booked for the barge-boys’ pandemonium.
Hallo! What’s Japp up to? Oh, I see. He’s sticking up the notice about
that key. I ought to have done that. Japp writes a shocking fist. I
must see if it is possible to make it out.”

As we approached the office I glanced at the sheet of paper which Mr.
Japp had just affixed to the window, and was able to read the rather
crabbed heading, “Ten Shillings Reward.” The rest of the inscription
being of no interest to me, I wished Bundy adieu and went on my way,
leaving him engaged in a critical inspection of the notice. Happening
to look back a few moments later, I saw him still gazing earnestly at
the paper, all unconscious of a lady in a pink hat who was tripping
lightly across the road and bearing down on him with an alluring
smile.

Threading my way among the foot-passengers who filled the narrow
pavements, I let my thoughts ramble idly from subject to subject; from
the expected visit of my two friends on the following Monday to the
alarming character of the local feminine population. But always they
tended to come back to my patient, Mrs. Frood. I had seen her on the
preceding night and had been very ill-satisfied with her appearance.
She had been paler than usual--more heavy-eyed and weary-looking; and
she had impressed me as being decidedly low-spirited. It seemed as
though the continual uncertainty and unrest, the abiding threat of
some intolerable action on the part of her worthless husband, were
becoming more than she could endure; and unwillingly I was beginning
to recognize that it was my duty, both as her doctor and as her
friend, to advise her to move, at least for a time, to some locality
where she would be free from the constant fear of molestation.

The question was: when should I broach the subject? And that involved
the further question: when should I make my next visit? Inclination
suggested the present evening, but discretion hinted that I ought to
allow a decent interval between my calls; and thus oscillating between
the two, I found myself in a state of indecision which lasted for the
rest of the day. Eventually discretion conquered, and I decided to
postpone the visit and the proposal until the following evening.

The decision was reached about the time I should have been setting
forth to make the visit, and no sooner had that time definitely passed
than I began to regret my resolution and to be possessed by a
causeless anxiety. Restlessly I wandered from room to room; taking up
books, opening them and putting them down again, and generally
displaying the typical symptoms of an acute attack of fidgets until
Mrs. Dunk proceeded with a determined air to lay the supper, and drew
my attention to it with an emphasis which it was impossible to
disregard.

I had just drawn the cork of a bottle of Mr. Tucker’s claret when the
door-bell rang, an event without precedent in my experience. Silently
I replaced the newly-extracted cork and listened. Apparently it was a
patient, for I heard the street door close and footsteps proceed to
the consulting-room. A minute later Mrs. Dunk opened the dining-room
door and announced:

“Mrs. Frood to see you, sir.”

With a slight thrill of anxiety at this unexpected visit, I strode
out, and, crossing the hall, entered the somewhat dingy and
ill-lighted consulting-room. Mrs. Frood was seated in the patients’
chair, but she rose as I entered and held out her hand; and as I
grasped it, I noticed how tall she looked in her outdoor clothes. But
I also noticed that she was looking even more pale and haggard than
when I had seen her last.

“There is nothing the matter, I hope?” said I.

“No,” she answered; “nothing much more than usual; but I have come to
present a petition.”

I looked at her inquiringly, and she continued:

“I have been sleeping very badly, as you know. Last night I had
practically no sleep at all, and very little the night before; and I
feel that I really can’t face the prospect of another sleepless night.
Would you think it very immoral if I were to ask you for something
that would give me a few hours’ rest?”

“Certainly not,” I answered, though with no great enthusiasm, for I am
disposed to take hypnotics somewhat seriously. “You can’t go on
without sleep. I will give you one or two tablets to take before you
go to bed. They will secure you a decent night’s rest, and then I hope
you will feel a little brighter.”

“I hope so,” she said, with a weary sigh.

I looked at her critically. She was, as I have said, pale and haggard;
but there seemed to be something more; a certain wildness in her eyes
and a suggestion of fear.

“You are not looking yourself at all to-night,” I said. “What is it?”

“I don’t know,” she answered. “The same old thing, I suppose. But I do
feel rather miserable. I seem to have come to the end of my endurance.
I look into the future and it all seems dark. I am afraid of it. In
fact, I seem to have--you’ll think me very silly, I know--but I have
a sort of presentiment of evil. Of course, it’s all nonsense. But that
is what I feel.”

“Is there any reason for this presentiment?” I asked uneasily; for my
thoughts flew at once to that ill-omened figure that I had seen on the
bridge. “Has anything happened to occasion these forebodings?”

“Oh, nothing in particular,” she replied. But she spoke without
looking at me--an unusual thing for her to do--and I found in her
answer something ambiguous and rather evasive. Could it be that she
had seen her husband on that day when I had followed him? Or had he
been in the town again--this very day, perhaps? Or was there something
yet more significant, something even more menacing? That this deep
depression of spirits, these forebodings, were not without some
exciting cause I felt the strongest suspicion. But whatever the cause
might be, she was evidently unwilling to speak about it.

While I was speculating thus, I found myself looking her over with a
minute attention of which I was not conscious at the time; noting
little trivial details of her appearance and belongings with an odd
exactness of observation. My eyes travelled over the little hand-bag,
stamped with her initials, that rested on her lap; her dainty,
high-heeled shoes with their little oval buckles of darkened bronze;
the small brooch at her throat with the large opal in the middle and
the surrounding circle of little pearls, and even noted that one of
the pearls was missing and that the vacant place corresponded to the
figure three on a clock-dial. And then they would come back to her
face; to the set mouth and the downcast eyes with their expression of
gloomy reverie.

I was profoundly uneasy and was on the point of opening the subject of
her leaving the town. Then I decided that I would see her on the
morrow and would go into the matter then. Accordingly I went into the
surgery and put a few tablets of sulphonal into a little box, and
having stuck one of Dr. Partridge’s labels on it, wrote the directions
and then wrapped it up and sealed it.

“There,” I said, giving it to her, “take a couple of those tablets and
go to bed early, and let me find you looking a little more cheerful
to-morrow.”

She took the packet and dropped it into her bag. “It is very good of
you,” she said warmly. “I know you don’t like doing it, and that makes
it the more kind. But I will do as you tell me. I have just to go in
to Chatham, but when I get back I will go to bed quite early.”

I walked with her to the door, and when I had opened it she stopped
and held out her hand. “Good night,” she said, “and thank you so very
much. I expect you will find me a great deal better to-morrow.” She
pressed my hand slightly, made me a little bow, smiled, and, turning
away, passed out; and I now noticed that the haze which had hung over
the town all the afternoon had thickened into a definite fog. I
stepped out on to the threshold and watched her as she walked quickly
down the street, following the erect, dignified figure wistfully with
my eyes as it grew more and more shadowy and unsubstantial until it
faded into the fog and vanished. Then I went in to my solitary supper,
with an unwonted sense of loneliness; and throughout the long evening
I turned over again and again our unsatisfying talk and wondered
afresh whether that presentiment of evil was but the product of
insomnia and mental fatigue, or whether behind it was some sinister
reality.




 CHAPTER VII.
 MRS. GILLOW SOUNDS THE ALARM

Nine o’clock on the following morning found me still seated at the
breakfast table, with the debris of the meal before me and the Sunday
paper propped up against the coffee-pot. It was a pleasant, sunny
morning at the end of April. The birds were twittering joyously in the
trees at the back of the house, a premature bluebottle perambulated
the window-pane, after an unsuccessful attempt to crawl under the
dish-cover, and somewhere in the town an optimistic bell-ringer was
endeavouring to lure unwary loiterers out of the sunshine into the
shadow of the sanctuary.

It was all very agreeable and soothing. The birds were delightful in
the exuberance of their spirits; even the bluebottle was a harbinger
of summer; and the solo of the bell-ringer, softened by distance,
impinged gently on the appreciative ear, awakening a grateful sense of
immunity. The sunshine and the placid sounds were favourable to
reflection, which the Sunday paper was powerless to disturb. As my eye
roamed inattentively down the inconsequent column of printers’ errors,
my mind flitted, beelike, from topic to topic; from my vague
professional prospects to the visitors whom I was expecting on the
morrow and from them to the rather disturbing incident of the previous
evening. But here my thoughts had a tendency to stick; and I was just
considering whether the proprieties admitted of my making a morning
call on Mrs. Frood, with a view to clearing up the obscurity, when the
street-door bell rang. The unusual sound at such an unlikely time
caused me to sit up and listen with just a tinge of uneasy expectancy.
A few moments later Mrs. Dunk opened the door, and having stated
concisely and impassively, “Mrs. Gillow,” retired, leaving the door
ajar. I started up in something approaching alarm, and hurried across
to the consulting-room, where I found Mrs. Gillow standing by the
chair with anxiety writ large on her melancholy face.

“There’s nothing amiss, I hope, Mrs. Gillow?” said I.

“I am sorry to say there is, sir,” she replied. “I hope you’ll excuse
me for disturbing you on a Sunday morning, but I thought, as you were
her doctor, and a friend, too, and I may say----”

“But what has happened?” I interrupted impatiently.

“Why, sir, the fact is that she went out last night and she hasn’t
come back.”

“You are quite sure she hasn’t come back?”

“Perfectly. I saw her just before she went out, and she said she was
coming to see you, to get something to make her sleep, and then she
was just going into Chatham, and that she would be back soon, so that
she could go to bed early. I sat up quite late listening for her, and
before I went to bed I went down and knocked at both her doors, and as
I didn’t get any answer, I looked into both rooms. But she wasn’t in
either, and her little supper was untouched on the table in the
sitting-room. I couldn’t sleep a wink all night for worrying about
her, and the first thing this morning I went down, and, when I found
the door unbolted and unchained, I went into her rooms again. But
there was no sign of her. Her supper was still there, untouched, and
her bed had not been slept in.”

“Did you look downstairs?” I asked.

“Yes. She usually kept the door of the basement stairs locked, I
think, but it was unlocked this morning, so I went down and searched
all over the basement; but she wasn’t there.”

“It is very extraordinary, Mrs. Gillow,” I said, “and rather alarming.
I certainly understood that she was going home as soon as she had been
to Chatham. By the way, do you know what she was going to Chatham
for?”

“I don’t, sir. She might have been going there to do some shopping,
but it was rather late, though it was Saturday night.”

“You don’t know, I suppose, whether she took any things with
her--though she couldn’t have taken much, as she had only a little
handbag with her when she came here.”

“She hasn’t taken any of her toilet things,” said Mrs. Gillow,
“because I looked over her dressing-table, and all her brushes and
things were there; and, as you say, she couldn’t have taken much in
that little bag. What do you think we had better do, sir?”

“I think,” said I, “that, in the first place, I will go and see Mr.
Japp. He is a relative and knows more about her than we do, and, of
course, it will be for him to take any measures that may seem
necessary. At any rate, I will see him and hear what he says.”

“Don’t you think we ought to let the police know?” she asked.

“Well, Mrs. Gillow,” I said, “we mustn’t be too hasty. Mrs. Frood had
reasons for avoiding publicity. Perhaps we had better not busy
ourselves too much until we are quite certain that she has gone. She
may possibly return in the course of the day.”

“I am sure I hope so,” she replied despondently. “But I am very much
afraid she won’t. I have a presentiment that something dreadful has
happened to her.”

“Why do you say that?” I asked. “Have you any reason for thinking so?”

“I have no actual reason,” she answered, “but I have always thought
that there was something behind her fear of meeting her husband.”

Having no desire to discuss speculative opinions, I made no direct
reply to this. Apparently Mrs. Gillow had no more to tell, and as I
was anxious to see Mr. Japp and hear if he could throw any light on
the mystery, I adjourned the discussion on which she would have
embarked and piloted her persuasively towards the door. “I shall see
you again later, Mrs. Gillow,” I said, “and will let you know if I
hear anything. Meanwhile, I think you had better not speak of the
matter to anybody.”

As soon as she was gone I made rapid preparations to go forth on my
errand, and a couple of minutes later was speeding down the street at
a pace dictated rather by the agitation of my mind than by any urgency
of purpose. Although, by an effort of will, I had preserved a quiet,
matter-of-fact demeanour while I was talking to Mrs. Gillow, her
alarming news had fallen on me like a thunder-bolt; and even now, as I
strode forward swiftly, my thoughts seemed numbed by the suddenness of
the catastrophe. That something terrible had happened I had little
more doubt than had Mrs. Gillow, and a good deal more reason for my
fears; for that last interview with the missing woman, looked back
upon by the light of her unaccountable disappearance, now appeared
full of dreadful suggestions. I had thought that she looked
frightened, and she admitted to a presentiment of evil. Of whom or of
what was she afraid?

And what did she mean by a presentiment? Reasonable people do not have
gratuitous presentiments; and I recalled her evasive reply when I
asked if she had any reasons for her foreboding of evil. Now, there
was little doubt that she had; that the shadow of some impending
danger had fallen on her and that she knew it.

As I approached the premises of Japp and Bundy, I was assailed by a
sudden doubt as to whether Mr. Japp lived there; and this doubt
increased when I had executed two loud knocks at the door without
eliciting any response. I was just raising my hand to make a third
attack when I became aware of Bundy’s head rising above the curtain of
the office window; and even in my agitation I could not but notice its
extremely dishevelled state. His hair--usually “smarmed” back neatly
from the forehead and brushed over the crown of his head--now hung
down untidily over his face like a bunch of rat’s tails, and the
unusualness of his appearance was increased by the fact that he wore
neither spectacles nor the indispensable eyeglass. The apparition,
however, was visible but for a moment, for even as I glanced at him he
made a sign to me to wait and forthwith vanished.

There followed an interval of about a minute, at the end of which the
door opened and I entered, discovering Bundy behind it in a
dressing-gown and pyjamas, but with his hair neatly brushed and his
eye-glass duly adjusted.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, Doc.,” said he. “Fact is, your knock woke
me. The early bird catches the worm in his pyjamas.”

“I apologize for disturbing your slumbers,” said I, “but I wanted to
see Japp. Isn’t he in?”

“Japp doesn’t live here,” said Bundy, motioning to me to follow him
upstairs. “He used to, but the house began to fill up with the
business stuff and we had to make a drawing office and a store-room,
so he moved off to a house on Boley Hill, and now I live here like
Robinson Crusoe.”

“Do you mean that you do your own cooking and housework?”

“Lord, no,” he replied. “I get most of my meals at Japp’s place.
Prepare my own breakfast sometimes--I’m going to now: and I make tea
for us both. Got a little gas-stove in the kitchen. And a charlady
comes in every day to wash up and do my rooms. If you are not in a
hurry, I’ll walk round with you to Japp’s house.”

“I am in rather a hurry,” said I; “at least--well, I don’t know why I
should be; but I am rather upset. The fact is, a very alarming thing
has happened. I have just heard of it from Mrs. Gillow. It seems that
Mrs. Frood went out last evening and has not come back.”

Bundy whistled. “She’s done a bolt,” said he. “I wonder why. Do you
think she can have run up against hubby in the town?”

“I don’t believe for a moment that she has gone away voluntarily,”
said I. “She came to see me last night to get a sedative because she
couldn’t sleep, and she said that she was going home as soon as she
had been to Chatham, and that she was going to take her medicine and
go to bed early.”

“That might have been a blind,” suggested Bundy; “or she might have
run up against her husband in Chatham.”

I shook my head impatiently. “That is all nonsense, Bundy. A woman
doesn’t walk off into space in that fashion. Something has happened to
her, I feel sure. I only hope it isn’t something horrible; one doesn’t
dare to think of the possibilities that the circumstances suggest.”

“No,” said Bundy, “and it’s better not to. Great mistake to let your
imagination run away with you. Don’t you worry, Doc. She’ll probably
turn up all right, or send Japp a line to say where she has gone to.”

“Devil take it, Bundy!” I exclaimed irritably, “you are talking as if
she were just a cat that had strayed away. If you don’t care a hang
what becomes of her, I do. I am extremely alarmed about her. How soon
will you be ready?”

“I’ll run and get on my things at once,” he replied, with a sudden
change of manner. “You must excuse me, old chap. I didn’t realize that
you were so upset. I’ll be with you in a few minutes and then we will
start. Japp will be able to give me some breakfast.”

He bustled off--to the next room, as I gathered from the sound--and
left me to work off my impatience by gazing out of the window and
pacing restlessly up and down the barely-furnished sitting-room. But,
impatient as I was, the rapidity with which he made his toilet
surprised me, for in less than ten minutes he reappeared, spick and
span, complete with hat, gloves, and stick, and announced that he was
ready.

“I am not usually such a sluggard,” he said, as we walked quickly
along the street, “but yesterday evening I got a novel. I ought not to
read novels. When I do, I am apt to make a single mouthful of it; and
that is what I did last night. I started the book at nine and finished
it at two this morning; and the result is that I am as sleepy as an
owl even now.”

In illustration of this statement he gave a prodigious yawn and then
turned up the steep little thoroughfare, where he presently halted at
the door of a small, old-fashioned house and rang the bell. The door
was opened by a middle-aged servant, from whom he learned that Mr.
Japp was at home, and to whom Bundy communicated his needs in the
matter of breakfast. We found Mr. Japp seated by the dining-room
window, studying a newspaper with the aid of a large pipe, and Bundy
proceeded to introduce me and the occasion of my visit in a few crisp
sentences.

Mr. Japp’s reception of the news was very different from his
partner’s. Starting up from his chair and taking his pipe from his
mouth, he gazed at me for some seconds in silent dismay.

“I suppose,” he said at length, “there is no mistake. It is really
certain that she did not come back last night?”

“I am afraid there is no doubt of the fact,” I replied, and I gave him
the details with which Mrs. Gillow had furnished me.

“Dear! dear!” he exclaimed. “I don’t like the look of this at all.
What the deuce can have happened to her?”

Here Bundy repeated the suggestion that he had made to me, but Japp
shook his head. “She wouldn’t have gone off without letting me or the
doctor know. Why should she? We are friends, and she knew she could
trust us. Besides, the thing isn’t possible. A middle-class woman
can’t set out like a tramp without any luggage or common necessaries.
There’s only one possibility,” he added after a pause. “She might have
seen Nicholas prowling about and gone straight to the station and
taken a train to London. One of her woman friends would have been able
to put her up for the night.”

“Or,” suggested Bundy, “she might even have gone up to town with Nick
himself if he met her and threatened to make a scene.”

“Yes,” said Japp doubtfully, “that is, I suppose, possible. But it
isn’t in the least likely. For that matter, nothing is likely. It is a
most mysterious affair, and very disturbing, very disturbing, indeed.”

“The question is,” said I, “what is to be done? Do you think we ought
to communicate with the police?”

“Well, no,” he replied; “not immediately. If we don’t hear anything,
say to-morrow, I suppose we shall have to. But we had better not be
precipitate. If we go to the police, we shall have to tell them
everything. Let us give her time to communicate, in case she has had
to make a sudden retirement--a clear forty-eight hours, as it is a
week-end. But we had better make some cautious inquiries meanwhile. I
suggest that we walk up to the hospital. They know me pretty well
there, and I could just informally ascertain whether any accidents had
been admitted, without giving any detailed reasons for the inquiry.
Are you coming with us, Bundy?”

“Yes,” replied Bundy, who, having been provided with a light
breakfast, was despatching it with lightning speed; “I shall be ready
by the time you have got your boots on.”

A few minutes later we set forth together, and made our way straight
to the hospital. Bundy and I waited outside while Japp went in to make
his inquiries; and, as we walked up and down, my imagination busied
itself in picturing the hideous possibilities suggested by a somewhat
extensive experience of the casualty department of a general hospital.
Presently Japp emerged, shaking his head.

“She is not there,” said he. “There were no casualties of any kind
admitted last night or since.”

“Is there no other hospital?” I asked.

“None but the military hospital,” he replied. “All the casualties from
the district would be brought here. So we seem to be at the end of our
resources, short of inquiring at the police-station; and even if that
were advisable, it would be useless, for if--anything had
happened--anything, I mean, that we hope has not happened--Mrs. Gillow
would have heard. She will be sure to have had something about her by
which she could have been identified.”

“She had,” said I. “The little box that I gave her had her name and my
address on it.”

“Then,” said Japp. “I don’t see that we can do anything more. We can
only wait until to-morrow evening or Tuesday morning, and if we don’t
get any news of her by then, notify the police.”

Unwillingly I had to admit that this was so; and when I had walked
back with the partners to Mr. Japp’s house, I left them and proceeded
to report to Mrs. Gillow and to ascertain whether, in the meantime,
she had received any tidings of her missing tenant.

It was with more of fear than hope that I plied the familiar knocker,
but the eager, expectant face that greeted me when the door opened,
while it relieved the one, banished the other. She had heard nothing,
and when I had communicated my own unsatisfactory report she groaned
and shook her head.

“You are quite sure,” I said, after an interval of silence, “that she
did not return from Chatham?”

“I don’t see how she could have done,” was the reply. “You see, it was
like this: I was going to see my sister at Frindsbury, and as I came
down to the hall, Mrs. Frood opened her door and spoke to me. She had
her hat on then, and she told me she was coming to you, and then going
on to Chatham, but that she would be back pretty soon, and was going
to bed early. I went out, leaving her at her room door, and took the
tram to Frindsbury, and I got back home about a quarter to ten. Her
sitting-room door was open, and I could see that she hadn’t gone to
bed, because her lamp was alight and her supper tray was on the table
and hadn’t been touched. I knocked at her bedroom door, but there was
no answer, so I went upstairs and sat up listening for her, and before
I went to bed I went down again, as I told you.”

“What time was it when you went out?” I asked.

“About a quarter past eight. I told her I was going to Frindsbury, and
that I should be home before ten, and I asked her not to bolt the door
if she came in before me.”

“Then,” said I, “she must have gone out directly after you, because it
was only a little after half-past eight when she called on me; and
presumably she went straight on to Chatham. If we only knew what she
was going there for we might be able to trace her. Did she know
anybody at Chatham?”

“So far as I know,” replied Mrs. Gillow, “she didn’t know anybody here
but you and Mr. Japp. I can’t imagine what she could have been going
to Chatham for.”

After a little further talk, I took my leave and walked homeward in a
very wretched frame of mind. Tormented as I was with a gnawing
anxiety, inaction was intolerable. Yet there was nothing to be done;
nothing but to wait in the feeble hope that the morning might bring
some message of relief, and with a heavy foreboding that the tidings,
when they came, would be evil tidings. But I found it impossible to
wait passively at home. At intervals during the day I went forth to
wander up and down the streets; and some impulse which I hardly dared
to recognize directed my steps again and again to the wharves and
foreshore that lie by the bend of the river between Rochester and
Chatham.

On the following morning I betook myself as early as I decently could
to the office of Japp and Bundy. No letter had arrived by the early
post, nor, when I repeated my visit later, was there any news, either
by post or telegram, or from Mrs. Gillow. I paid a furtive visit to
the police-station and glanced nervously over the bills on the
notice-board, and I made another perambulation of the waterside
districts, which occupied me until it was time for me to repair to the
station to meet the train by which my friends were expected to arrive,
and did, in fact, arrive.

As we walked from the station to my house Jervis looked at me
critically from time to time. After one of these inspections he
remarked:

“I don’t know whether it is my fancy, Strangeways, but it seems to me
that the cares of medical practice are affecting your spirits. You
look worried.”

“I am worried,” I replied. “There has been a very disturbing
development of that case that I was telling you about.”

“The doper, you mean?”

“His wife. She has disappeared. She went out on Saturday night and has
not been seen since.”

“That sounds rather ominous,” said Jervis. “I presume the
circumstances--if you know them--could be communicated without any
breach of confidence.”

“They will have to be made fully public if she doesn’t turn up by this
evening,” I replied, “and I am only too glad of the chance to talk the
matter over with you,” and forthwith I proceeded to give a
circumstantial account of the events connected with the disappearance,
not omitting any detail that seemed to have the slightest bearing. And
I now felt justified in relating my experience when I was acting for
Dr. Pumphrey. The narrative was interrupted by our arrival at my
house, but when we had taken our places at the table it was continued
and listened to with intense interest by my two friends.

“Well,” said Jervis, when I had finished, “it has an ugly look,
especially when one considers it in connexion with that affair in
London. But there is something to be said for your friend Bundy’s
suggestion. Don’t you think so, Thorndyke?”

“Something, perhaps,” Thorndyke agreed, “but not much; and if no
letter arrives to-night or to-morrow morning, I should say it is
excluded. This lady seems to have had complete confidence in
Strangeways and in Mr. Japp. She could depend on their secrecy if she
had to move suddenly to a fresh locality; and she seems to have been a
responsible person who would not unnecessarily expose them to anxiety
about her safety. Moreover, she would know that, if she kept them in
the dark, they must unavoidably put the police on her track, which
would be the last thing that she would wish.”

“Can you make any suggestion as to what has probably happened?” I
asked.

“It is not of much use to speculate,” replied Thorndyke. “If we
exclude a voluntary disappearance, an accident or sudden illness, as
we apparently can, there seems to remain only the possibility of
crime. But to the theory of crime--of murder, to put it bluntly--there
is a manifest objection. So far as the circumstances are known to us,
a murder, if it had occurred, would have been an impromptu murder,
committed in a more or less public place. But the first indication of
a murder of that kind is usually the discovery of the body. Here,
however, thirty-six hours have elapsed, and no body has come to light.
On the other hand, we have to bear in mind that there is a large,
tidal river skirting the town. Into that river the missing lady might
have fallen accidentally, or have been thrown, dead or alive. But it
is not very profitable to speculate. We can neither form any opinion
nor take any action until we have some further facts.”

I must confess that, as I listened to Thorndyke thus calmly comparing
the horrible possibilities, I experienced a dreadful sinking of the
heart, but yet I realized that this passionless consideration of the
essential evidence was more to the point, and promised more result
than any amount of unskilful groping under the urge of emotion and
personal feeling. And, realizing this, I formed the bold resolution of
enlisting Thorndyke’s aid in a regular, professional capacity, and
began to cast about for the means of introducing the rather delicate
subject. But while I was reflecting, the opportunity was gone, at
least for the present. Lunch had virtually come to an end, for Mrs.
Dunk had silently and with iron visage just placed the port and the
coffee on the table and retired, when Jervis, who had observed her
with evident interest, inquired: “Does that old Sphinx do the cooking,
Strangeways?”

“She does everything,” I answered. “I have suggested that she should
get some help, but she just growled and ignored the suggestion.”

“Well,” said Jervis, “she doesn’t give you much excuse for growling.
She has turned out a lunch that would have done credit to Delmonico’s.
Are you coming to the inquest with us? We shall have to be starting in
a few minutes.”

“I may as well,” said I. “Then I can bring you back to tea. And I want
to make a proposal, which we can discuss as we go along. It is with
regard to the case of Mrs. Frood.”

As my two friends looked at me inquiringly but made no remark, I
poured out the coffee and continued: “You see, Mrs. Frood was my
patient, and, in a way, my friend; in fact, with the exception of
Japp, I was the only friend she had in the place. Consequently I take
it as my duty to ascertain what has happened to her, and, if she has
come to any harm, to see that the wrongdoers are brought to account.
Of course, I am not competent to investigate the case myself, but I am
in the position to bear any costs that the investigation would
entail.”

“Lucky man,” said Jervis. “And what is the proposal?”

“I was wondering,” I replied, a little nervously, “whether I could
prevail on you to undertake the case.”

Jervis glanced at his senior, and the latter replied: “It is just a
little premature to speak of a ‘case.’ The missing lady may return or
communicate with her friends. If she does not, the inquiry will fall
into the hands of the police; and there is no reason to suppose that
they will not be fully competent to deal with it. They have more means
and facilities than we have. But if the inquiry should become
necessary, and the police should be unsuccessful, Jervis and I would
be prepared to render you any assistance that we could.”

“On professional terms,” I stipulated.

Thorndyke smiled. “The financial aspects of the case,” said he, “can
be considered when they arise. Now, I think, it is time for us to
start.”

As we walked down to the building where the inquest was to be held, we
pursued the topic, and Thorndyke pointed out my position in the case.

“You notice, Strangeways,” said he, “that you are the principal
witness. You are the last person who saw Mrs. Frood before her
disappearance, you heard her state her intended movements, you knew
her circumstances, you saw and examined her husband, and you alone can
give an exact description of her as she was at the time when she
disappeared. I would suggest that, during the inquest, which will not
interest you, you might usefully try to reconstitute that last
interview and make full notes in writing of all that occurred with a
very careful and detailed description of the person, clothing, and
belongings of the missing lady. The police will want this information,
and so shall I, if I am to give any consideration to the case.”

On this suggestion I proceeded to act as soon as we had taken our
places at the foot of the long table occupied by the coroner and the
jury, detaching myself as well as I could from the matter of the
inquest; and by the time that the deliberations were at an end and the
verdict agreed upon, I had drafted out a complete set of notes and
made two copies, one for the police and one for Thorndyke.

As soon as we were outside the court I presented the latter copy,
which Thorndyke read through.

“This is admirable, Strangeways,” said he, as he placed it in his
note-case. “I must compliment you upon your powers of observation. The
description of the missing lady is remarkably clear and exhaustive.
And now I would suggest that you call in at Mr. Japp’s office on our
way back, and ascertain whether any letter has been received. If there
has been no communication we shall have to regard the appearances as
suspicious, and calling for investigation.”

Secretly gratified at the interest which Thorndyke seemed to be
developing in the mystery, I conducted my friends up the High-street
until we reached the office, which I entered, leaving my colleagues
outside. Mr. Japp looked up from a letter which he was writing, and
Bundy, who had been peeping over the curtain, revolved on his stool
and faced me.

“Any news?” I asked.

Japp shook his head gloomily. “Not a sign,” said he. “I shall wait
until the first post is in to-morrow morning, and then, if there are
no tidings of her, I shall go across to the police station. Perhaps
you had better come with me, as you are able to give the particulars
that they will want.”

“Very well,” I said, “I will look in at half-past nine”; and with this
I was turning away when Bundy inquired: “Are those two toffs outside
friends of yours?” and, on my replying in the affirmative, he
continued: “They seem to be taking a deuce of an interest in Japp’s
proclamation. You might tell them that if they happen to have found
that key, the money is quite safe. I will see that Japp pays up.”

I promised to deliver the message, and, as Bundy craned up to make a
further inspection of my colleagues, I departed to join the latter.

“There is no news up to the present,” I said, “but Japp proposes to
wait until to-morrow morning for a last chance before applying to the
police.”

“Was that Japp who was inspecting us through that preposterous pair of
barnacles?” Jervis asked.

“No,” I answered. “That was Bundy. He suspects you of having found
that key and of holding on to it until you are sure of the reward.”

“What key is it?” asked Jervis. “The key of the strong-room? They seem
to be in a rare twitter about it.”

“No; it is just a gate-key belonging to a piece of waste land where
they are doing some repairs to the old city wall. And, by the way,
thereby hangs a tale; a horrible and tragic tale of a convivial
bargee, which ought to have a special interest for a pair of medical
jurists”--and here I related to them the gruesome story that was told
to Bundy and me by the old mortar-mixer.

They both chuckled appreciatively at the dénouement, and Jervis
remarked:

“It would seem that the late Bill was a rather inflammable gentleman.
The yarn recalls the tragic end of Mr. Krook in ‘Bleak House,’ only
that Krook went one better than Bill, for he managed to combust
himself in an hour or two without any lime at all.”

The story and the comment brought us to my house, which we had no
sooner entered than Mrs. Dunk, who seemed to have been lying in wait
for us, made her appearance with the tea; and while we were disposing
of this refreshment Thorndyke reverted to the case of my missing
patient.

“As I am to keep an eye on this case,” said he, “I shall want to be
kept in touch with it. Of course, the actual investigation--if there
has to be one--will need to be conducted on the spot, which is not
possible to me. What I suggest is that you write out a detailed
account of everything that is known to you in connexion with it. Don’t
select your facts. Put down everything in any way connected with the
case and say all you know about the person concerned--Mrs. Frood
herself and everybody who was acquainted with her. Send this statement
to me and keep a copy. Then, if any new fact becomes known, let me
have it and make a note of it for your own information. You are on the
spot and I shall look to you for the data; and if I want any of them
amplified or confirmed I shall communicate with you.

“There is one other matter. Do not confide to anyone that you have
consulted me or that I am interested in the case; neither to Mr. Japp,
to the police, nor to anybody else whatsoever; and I advise you to
keep your own interest in the mystery to yourself as far as possible.”

“What is the need of this secrecy?” I asked, in some surprise.

“The point is,” replied Thorndyke, “that when you are investigating a
crime you are playing against the criminal. But if the criminal is
unknown to you you are playing against an unseen adversary. If you are
visible to him he can watch your moves and reply to them. Obviously
your policy is to keep out of sight and make your moves unseen. And
remember that as long as you do not know who the criminal is you don’t
know who he is not. Anyone may be the criminal, or may be his
unconscious agent or coadjutor. If you make confidences they may be
innocently passed on to the guilty parties. So keep your own counsel
rigorously. If there has been a crime, that crime has local connexions
and probably a local origin. The solution of the mystery will probably
be discovered here. And if you intend to take a hand in the solution
let it be a lone hand; and keep me informed of everything that you do
or observe; and for my part, I will give you all the help I can.”

By the time we had finished our tea and our discussion the hour of my
friends’ departure was drawing nigh. I walked with them to the
station, and when I bade them farewell I received a warm invitation to
visit them at their chambers in the Temple; an invitation of which I
determined to avail myself on the first favourable opportunity.




 CHAPTER VIII.
 SERGEANT COBBLEDICK TAKES A HAND

Punctually at half-past nine on the following morning I presented
myself at the office, and, if I had indulged in any hopes of
favourable news--which I had not--they would have been dispelled by a
glance at Mr. Japp’s troubled face.

“I suppose you have heard nothing?” I said, when we had exchanged
brief greetings.

He shook his head gloomily as he opened the cupboard and took out his
hat.

“No,” he answered, “and I am afraid we never shall.” He sighed
heavily, and, putting on his hat, walked slowly to the door. “It is a
dreadful affair,” he continued, as we went out together. “How she
would have hated the idea of it, poor girl! All the horrid publicity,
the posters, the sensational newspaper paragraphs, the descriptions of
her person and belongings. And then, at the end of it all, God knows
what horror may come to light. It won’t bear thinking of.”

He trudged along at my side with bent head and eyes cast down, and for
the remainder of the short journey neither of us spoke. On reaching
the police-station we made our way into a small, quiet office, the
only tenant of which was a benevolent-looking, bald-headed sergeant,
who was seated at a high desk, and, who presented that peculiar,
decapitated aspect that appertains to a police officer minus his
helmet. As we entered the sergeant laid down his pen and turned to us
with a benign smile.

“Good morning, Mr. Japp,” said he. “What can I have the pleasure of
doing for you?”

“I am sorry to say, Sergeant,” replied Japp, “that I have come here on
very unpleasant business,” and he proceeded to give the officer a
concise summary of the facts, to which our friend listened with close
attention. When it was finished, the sergeant produced a sheet of blue
foolscap, and, having folded a wide margin on it, dipped his pen in
the ink and began his examination.

“I’d better take the doctor’s statement first,” said he. “The lady’s
name is Angelina Frood, married, living apart from husband--I shall
want his address presently--last seen alive by----”

“John Strangeways, M.D.,” said I, “of Maidstone-road, Rochester.”

The sergeant wrote this down, and continued: “Last seen at about 8.30
P.M. on Saturday, 26th April, proceeding towards Chatham, on unknown
business. Can you give me a description of her?”

I described her person, assisted by Japp, and the sergeant, having
committed the particulars to writing, read them out:

“‘Age 28, height 5 ft. 7 in., complexion medium, hazel eyes, abundant
dark brown hair, strongly marked black eyebrows, nearly meeting over
nose.’

“No special marks that you know of?”

“No.”

“Now, Doctor, can you tell us how she was dressed?”

“She was wearing a snuff-brown coat and skirt,” I replied, “and a
straw hat of the same colour with a broad, dull green band. The hat
was fixed on by two hat-pins with silver heads shaped like
poppy-capsules. The coat had six buttons, smallish, bronze
buttons--about half an inch in diameter--with a Tudor rose embossed on
each. Brown suède gloves with fasteners--no buttons--brown silk
stockings, and brown suède shoes with small, oval bronze buckles. She
had a narrow silk scarf, dull green, with three purple bands at each
end--one broad band and two narrow--and knotted fringe at the ends.
She wore a small circular brooch with a largish opal in the centre and
a border of small pearls, of which one was missing. The missing pearl
was in the position of the figure three on a clock dial. She carried a
small morocco hand-bag with the initials A. F. stamped on it, which
contained a little cardboard box, in which were six white tablets; the
box was labelled with one of Dr. Partridge’s labels, on which her name
was written, and it was wrapped in white paper and sealed with
sealing-wax. That is all I can say for certain. But she always wore a
wedding-ring, and occasionally an African Zodiac ring; but sometimes
she carried this ring in a small purse with metal jaws and a ball
fastening. I believe she always carried the purse.”

As I gave this description, the sergeant wrote furiously, glancing at
me from time to time with an expression of surprise, while Japp sat
and stared at me open-mouthed.

“Well, Doctor,” said the sergeant, when he had taken down my statement
and read it out, “if I find myself ailing I’m going to pop along and
consult you. I reckon there isn’t much that escapes your notice. With
regard to that African ring now, I daresay you can tell us what it is
like.”

I was, of course, able to describe it in detail, including the
initials A. C. inside, and even to give a rough sketch of some of the
signs embossed on it, upon which the sergeant chuckled admiringly and
wagged his head as he wrote down the description and pinned the sketch
on the margin of his paper. The rest of my statement dealt with the
last interview and the incidents connected with Nicholas Frood’s
visits to Rochester, all of which the sergeant listened to with deep
interest and committed to writing.

Finally, I recounted the sinister incident--now more sinister than
ever--of the murderous assault in the house near Regent’s Park,
whereat the sergeant looked uncommonly serious and took down the
statement verbatim.

“Did you know about this, Mr. Japp?” he asked.

“I knew that something unpleasant had happened,” was the reply, “but I
didn’t know that it was as bad as this.”

“Well,” said the sergeant, “it gives the present affair rather an ugly
look. We shall have to make some inquiries about that gentleman.”

Having squeezed me dry, he turned his attention to Japp, from whom he
extracted a variety of information, including the address of the
banker who paid the allowance to Nicholas Frood, and that of a lady
who had formerly been a theatrical colleague of Mrs. Frood’s, and with
whom Mr. Japp believed the latter had kept up a correspondence.

“You haven’t a photograph of the missing lady, I suppose?” said the
sergeant.

With evident reluctance Japp drew from his pocket an envelope and
produced from it a cabinet photograph, which he looked at sadly for a
few moments and then handed to me.

“I brought this photograph with me,” he said, “as I knew you would
want it, but I rather hope that you won’t want to publish it.”

“Now, why do you hope that?” the sergeant asked in a soothing and
persuasive tone. “You want this lady found--or, at any rate, traced.
But what better means can you suggest than publishing her portrait?”

“I suppose you are right,” said Japp; “but it is a horrible thing to
think of the poor girl’s face looking out from posters and newspaper
pages.”

“It is,” the sergeant agreed. “But, you see, if she is alive it is her
own doing, and if she is dead it won’t affect her.”

While they were talking I had been looking earnestly at the beloved
face, which I now felt I should never look upon again. It was an
excellent likeness, showing her just as I had known her, excepting
that it was free from the cloud of trouble that had saddened her
expression in these latter days. As the sergeant held out his hand for
it, I turned it over and read the photographer’s name and address and
the register number, and, having made a mental note of them, I
surrendered it with a sigh.

Our business was now practically concluded. When we had each read over
the statements and added our respective signatures, the sergeant
attested them and, having added the date, placed the documents in his
desk and rose.

“I am much obliged to you, gentlemen,” said he as he escorted us to
the door. “If I hear anything that will interest you I will let you
know, and if I should want any further information I shall take the
liberty of calling on you.”

“Well,” said Japp, as we turned to walk back, “the fat’s in the fire
now. I mean to say,” he added quickly, “that we’ve fairly committed
ourselves. I hope we haven’t been too precipitate. We should catch it
if she came back and found that we had raised the hue and cry and set
the whole town agog.”

“I am afraid there is no hope of that,” said I. “At any rate, we had
no choice or discretion in the matter. A suspected crime is the
business of the police.”

Mr. Japp agreed that this was so; and having by this time arrived at
the office, we separated, he to enter his premises and I to betake
myself to Chatham with no very defined purpose, but lured thither by a
vague attraction.

As I walked along the High-street, making occasional digressions into
narrow alleys to explore wharves and water-side premises, I turned
over the statements that had been given to the police and wondered
what they conveyed to our friend, the sergeant, with his presumably
extensive experience of obscure crime. To me they seemed to furnish no
means whatever of starting an investigation, excepting by inquiring as
to the movements of Nicholas Frood, by communicating with Angelina’s
late colleague or by publishing the photograph. And here I halted to
write down in my note-book before I should forget them the name and
address of that lady--Miss Cumbers--and of the photographers, together
with the number of the photograph; for I had decided to obtain a copy
of the latter for myself, and it now occurred to me that I had better
get one also for Thorndyke. And this latter reflection reminded me
that I had to prepare my précis of the facts for him, and that I
should do well to get this done at once while the matter of the two
statements was fresh in my mind. Accordingly, as I paced the deck of
the Sun Pier, looking up and down the busy river, with its endless
procession of barges, bawleys, tugs, and cargo boats, striving
ineffectually to banish the dreadful thought that, perchance,
somewhere, at this very moment there was floating on its turbid waters
the corpse of my dear, lost friend: I tried to recall and write down
the substance of Japp’s statement, as I had heard it made and had
afterwards read it. At length, finding the neighbourhood of the river
too disturbing, I left the pier and took my way homewards, calling in
at a stationer’s on the way to provide myself with a packet of sermon
paper on which to write out my summary.

When Thorndyke had given me my instructions, they had appeared to me a
little pedantic. The full narrative which he asked for of all the
events, without selection as to relevancy, and the account of what I
knew of all the persons concerned in the case, seemed an excessive
formality. But when I came to write the case out the excellence of his
method became apparent in two respects. In the first place, the
ordered narrative put the events in their proper sequence and
exhibited their connexions; and in the second, the endeavour to state
all that I knew, particularly of the persons, showed me how very
little that was. Of the persons in any way concerned in the case there
were but five: Angelina herself, her husband, Mrs. Gillow, Mr. Japp,
and Bundy. Of the first two I knew no more than what I had observed
myself and what Angelina had told me; of the last three I knew
practically nothing. Not that this appeared to me of the slightest
importance, but I had my instructions, and in compliance with them I
determined to make such cautious inquiries as would enable me to give
Thorndyke at least a few particulars of them. And this during the next
few days I did; and I may as well set down here the scanty and rather
trivial information that my inquiries elicited, and which I duly sent
on to Thorndyke in a supplementary report.

Mrs. Gillow was the wife of a mariner who was the second mate of a
sailing ship that plied to Australia, who had now been away about four
months and was expected home shortly. She was a native of the locality
and had known Mr. Japp for several years. She occupied the part of the
house above the ground floor and kept no servant or dependent, living
quite alone when her husband was at sea. She had no children. Her
acquaintance with Angelina began when the latter became the tenant of
the ground floor and basement; it was but a slight acquaintance, and
she knew nothing of Angelina’s antecedents or affairs excepting that
she had left her husband.

Mr. Japp was a native of Rochester and had lived in the town all his
life, having taken over his business establishment from his late
partner, a Mr. Borden. He was a bachelor and was related to Angelina
by marriage, his brother--now deceased--having married Angelina’s
aunt.

As to Bundy, he was hardly connected with the case at all, since he
had seen Angelina only once or twice and had scarcely exchanged a
dozen words with her. Moreover, he had but recently come to
Rochester--about six weeks ago, I gathered--having answered an
advertisement of Japp’s for an assistant with a view to partnership;
and the actual deed had not yet been executed, though the two partners
were evidently quite well satisfied with one another.

That was all the information that I had to give Thorndyke; and with
the exception of the London incident it amounted to nothing.
Nevertheless, it was as well to have established the fact that if
anyone were concerned in Angelina’s disappearance, that person would
have to be sought elsewhere than in Rochester.

Having sent off my summary and read over again and again the copy
which I had kept, I began to realize the justice of Thorndyke’s
observation that the inquiry was essentially a matter for the police,
who had both the experience and the necessary facilities; for whenever
I tried to think of some plan for tracing my lost friend, I was
brought up against the facts that I had nothing whatever to go on and
no idea how to make a start. As to Thorndyke, he had no data but those
that I had given him, and I realized clearly that these were utterly
insufficient to form the basis of any investigation; and I found
myself looking expectantly to the police to produce some new facts
that might throw at least a glimmer of light on this dreadful and
baffling mystery.

I had not very long to wait. On the Friday after our call on the
sergeant, I was sitting after lunch in my dining-room with a book in
my hand, while my thoughts strayed back to those memorable evenings of
pleasant converse with the sweet friend who, I felt, had gone from me
for ever, when the door bell rang, and Mrs. Dunk presently announced:

“Sergeant Cobbledick.”

“Show him in here, Mrs. Dunk,” said I, laying aside my book, and
rising to receive my visitor; who proved to be, as I had expected, the
officer who had taken our statements. He entered with his helmet in
his hand, and greeted me with a smile of concentrated benevolence.

“Sit down, Sergeant,” said I, offering him an easy-chair. “I hope you
have some news for us.”

“Yes,” he replied, beaming on me. “I am glad to say we are getting on
as well as we can expect. We have made quite a nice little start.”

He spoke as if he had something particularly gratifying to
communicate, and, having carefully placed his helmet on the table, he
drew from his pocket a small paper packet, which he opened with great
deliberation, extracting from it a small object, which he held out in
the palm of his hand.

“There, Doctor,” said he, complacently; “what do you say to that?”

I looked at the object, and my heart seemed to stand still. It was
Angelina’s brooch! I stared at it in speechless dismay for some
moments. At length I asked, huskily: “Where did you get it?”

“I found it,” said the sergeant, gazing fondly at the little trinket,
“where I hardly hoped to find it--in a pawnbroker’s shop in Chatham.”

“Did you discover who pawned it?” I asked.

“In a sense, yes,” the sergeant replied with a bland smile.

“How do you mean--in a sense?” I inquired.

“I mean that his name was John Smith--only, of course, it wasn’t; and
that his address was 26, Swoffer’s-alley, Chatham--only he didn’t live
there, because there is no such number. You see, Doctor, John Smith is
the name of nearly every man who gives a false description of himself;
and I went straight off to Swoffer’s-alley--it was close by--and found
that there wasn’t any number 26.”

“Then you really don’t know who pawned it?”

“We won’t exactly say that,” he replied. “I got a fair description of
the man from the pawnbroker’s wife, who made out the ticket and says
she could swear to the man if she saw him. He was a seafaring man,
dressed in sailor’s clothes--a peaked cap and pea-jacket--a shortish
fellow, rather sunburnt, with a small, stubby, dark moustache and dark
hair, and a mole or wart on the left side of his nose, near the tip.
She asked him where he had got the brooch, and he said it had belonged
to his old woman. I should say he probably picked it up.”

“Why do you think so?” I asked.

“Well, if he had--er--got it in any other way, he would hardly have
popped it in Chatham forty-eight hours after the--after it was lost,
with the chance that the pawnbrokers had already been notified--he
pawned it on Monday night.”

“Then,” said I, “if he picked it up, he isn’t of much importance; and
in any case you don’t know who he is.”

“Oh, but he is of a good deal of importance,” said the sergeant. “I’ve
no doubt he picked it up, but that is only a guess. He may have got it
the other way. But at any rate, he had it in his possession and he
will have to give an account of how he obtained it. The importance of
it is this: taken with the disappearance, the finding of this brooch
raises a strong suspicion that a crime has been committed, and if we
could find out where it was picked up, we should have a clue to the
place where the affair took place. I want that man very badly, and I’m
going to have a good try to get him.”

“I don’t quite see how,” said I. “You haven’t much to go on.”

“I’ve got his nose to go on,” replied the sergeant.

“But there must be plenty of other men with moles on their noses.”

“That’s their look-out,” he retorted. “If I come across a man who
answers the description, I shall hang on to him until Mrs. Pawnbroker
has had a look at him. Of course, if she says he’s not the man, he’ll
be released.”

“But she won’t,” said I. “If he has a mole on his nose, she will be
perfectly certain that he is the man.”

The sergeant smiled benignly. “There’s something in that,” he
admitted. “Ladies are a bit cock-sure when it comes to identification.
But you can generally check ’em by other evidence. And if this chap
picked the brooch up, he would be pretty certain to tell us all about
it when he heard where it came from. Still, we haven’t got him yet.”

For a while we sat without speaking, each pursuing his own thoughts.
To me, this dreadful discovery, though it did but materialize the
vague fears that had been surging through my mind, had fallen like a
thunderbolt. For, behind those fears, I now realized that there had
lurked a hope that the mystery might presently be resolved by the
return of the lost one. Now that hope had suddenly become extinct. I
knew that she had gone out of my life for ever. She was dead. This
poor little waif that had drifted back into our hands brought the
unmistakable message of her death, with horrible suggestions of
hideous and sordid tragedy. I shuddered at the thought; and in that
moment, from the grief and horror that possessed my soul, there was
born a passion of hatred for the wretch who had done this thing and a
craving for revenge.

“There’s another queer thing that has come to light,” the sergeant
resumed at length. “There may be nothing in it, but it’s a little
queer. About the husband, Nicholas Frood.”

“What about him?” I asked, eagerly.

“Why, he seems to have disappeared, too. Of course, you understand,
Doctor, that what I’m telling you is confidential. We are not talking
about this affair outside, and we aren’t telling the Press much, at
present.”

“Naturally,” said I. “You can trust me to keep my own counsel, and
yours, too.”

“I’m sure I can. Well, about this man, Frood. It seems that last
Friday he went away from his lodgings for a couple of days; but he
hasn’t come back, and nobody knows what has become of him. He was
supposed to be going to Brighton, where he has some relatives from
whom he gets a little assistance occasionally, but they have seen or
heard nothing of him. Quaint, isn’t it? You said you saw him here on
the Monday.”

“Yes, and I haven’t seen him since, though I have kept a look-out for
him. But he may have been here, all the same. It looks decidedly
suspicious.”

“It is queer,” the sergeant agreed, “but we’ve no evidence that he has
been in this neighbourhood.”

“Have you made any other inquiries?” I asked.

“We looked up that lady, Miss Cumbers, but we got nothing out of her.
She had had a letter from Mrs. Frood on the 24th--yesterday
week--quite an ordinary letter, giving no hint of any intention to go
away from Rochester. So there you are. The mystery seems to be
concerned entirely with this neighbourhood, and I expect we shall have
to solve it on the spot.”

This last observation impressed me strongly. The sergeant’s view of
the case was the same as Thorndyke’s, and expressed in almost the same
words.

“Have you any theory as to what has actually happened?” I asked.

The sergeant smiled in his benignant fashion. “It isn’t much use
inventing theories,” said he. “We’ve got to get the facts before we
can do anything. Still, looking at the case as we find it, there are
two or three things that hit us in the face. There is a strong
suspicion of murder, there is no trace of the body, and there is a big
tidal river close at hand. On Saturday night it was high water at
half-past eleven, so there wouldn’t have been much of the shore
uncovered at, say, half-past nine, and there would have been plenty of
water at any of the piers or causeways.”

“Then you think it probable that she was murdered and her body flung
into the river?”

“It is the likeliest thing, so far as we can judge. There is the
river, and there is no sign of the body on shore. But, as I say, it is
no use guessing. We’ve got people watching the river from Allington
Lock to Sheerness, and that’s all we can do in that line. The body is
pretty certain to turn up, sooner or later. Of course, until it does,
there is no real criminal case; and even when we’ve got the body, we
may not be much nearer getting the murderer. Excepting the man Frood,
there is no one who seems to have had any motive for making away with
her; and if it was just a casual robbery with murder it is unlikely
that we shall ever spot the man at all.”

Having given expression to this rather pessimistic view, the sergeant
rose, and, picking up his helmet, took his departure, after promising
to let me know of any further developments.

As soon as he was gone, I wrote down the substance of what he had
said, and then embodied it in a report for Thorndyke. While I was thus
occupied, the afternoon post was delivered, and included a packet from
the London photographer, to whom I had written, enclosing two copies
of the photograph of Angelina that Mr. Japp had handed to the
sergeant. Of these, I enclosed one copy in my communication to
Thorndyke, on the bare chance that it might be of some assistance to
him, and, having closed up the large envelope and stamped it, I went
forth to drop it into the post-box.




 CHAPTER IX.
 JETSAM

That portion of Chatham High-street which lies adjacent to the River
Medway presents a feature that is characteristic of old riverside
towns in the multitude of communications between the street and the
shore. Some of these are undisguised entrances to wharves, some are
courts or small thoroughfares lined with houses and leading to
landing-stages, while others are mere passages or flights of steps,
opening obscurely and inconspicuously on the street by narrow
apertures, unnoticed by the ordinary wayfarer and suggesting the
burrows of some kind of human water-rat.

In the days that followed the sergeant’s visit to me I made the
acquaintance of all of them. Now I would wander down the cobbled
cartway that led to a wharf, there to cast a searching eye over the
muddy fore-shore or scan the turbid water at high tide as it eddied
between the barges and around the piles. Or I would dive into the
mouths of the burrows, creeping down slimy steps and pursuing the
tortuous passages through a world of uncleanness until I came out upon
the shore, where the fresh smell of seaweed mingled with odours
indescribable. I began to be an object of curiosity--and perhaps of
some suspicion--to the denizens of the little, ruinous, timber houses
that lined these alleys, and of frank interest to the children who
played around the rubbish heaps or dabbled in the grey mud. But never
did my roving eye light upon that which it sought with such dreadful
expectation.

One afternoon, about a week after the sergeant’s visit, when I was
returning home from one of these explorations, I observed a man on my
doorstep as I approached the house. His appearance instantly aroused
my attention, for he was dressed in the amphibious style adopted by
waterside dwellers, and he held something in his hand at which he
looked from time to time. Before I reached the door it had opened and
admitted him, and when I arrived I found him in the hall nervously
explaining his business to Mrs. Dunk.

“Here _is_ the doctor,” said the latter; “you’d better tell him about
it.”

The man turned to me and held out an amazingly dirty fist. “I’ve got
something here, sir,” said he, “what belongs to you, I think.” Here he
unclosed his hand and exhibited a little cardboard box bearing one of
Dr. Partridge’s labels. It was smeared with mud and grime, but I
recognized it instantly; indeed, when I took it with trembling fingers
from his palm and looked at it closely, the name, “Mrs. Frood,” was
still decipherable under the smears of dirt.

“Where did you find this?” I asked.

“I picked it up on the strand,” he replied, “about halfway betwixt the
Sun Pier and the end of Ship Alley, and just below spring tide
high-water mark. Is it any good?”

“Yes,” I answered; “it is very important. I will get you to walk along
with me to the police station.”

“What for?” he demanded suspiciously. “I don’t want no police
stations. If it’s any good, give us what you think it’s worth, and
have done with it.”

I gave him half-a-crown to allay his suspicions, and then said: “You
had better come with me to the station. I expect the police will want
you to show them exactly where you found this box and help them to
search the place; and I will see that you are paid for your trouble.”

“But look ’ere, mister,” he objected; “what’s the police got to do
with this ’ere box?”

I explained the position to him briefly, and then, suddenly, his face
lit up. “I know,” he said excitedly. “I seen the bills stuck up on the
dead-’ouse door. And d’you mean to say as this ’ere box was ’ers? ’Cos
if it was it’s worth more’n ’arf-a-crown.”

“Perhaps it is,” said I. “We will hear what the sergeant thinks,” and
with this I opened the door and went out, and my new acquaintance now
followed with the greatest alacrity, taking the opportunity, as we
walked along, to remind me of my promise and to offer tentative
suggestions as to the scale of remuneration for his services.

Our progress along the High-street was not unnoticed. Doubtless, we
appeared a somewhat ill-assorted pair, for I observed a good many
persons turn to look at us curiously, and when we passed the office,
on the opposite side of the road, I saw Bundy’s face rise above the
curtain with an expression of undissembled curiosity.

On arriving at the station, I inquired for Sergeant Cobbledick, and
was fortunate enough to find him in his office. As I entered with my
companion, he bestowed on the latter a quick glance of professional
interest and then greeted me with a genial smile. It was hardly
necessary for me to state my business, for the single quick glance of
his experienced eye at my companion had furnished the diagnosis. I had
only to produce the box and indicate the finder.

“This looks like a lead,” said he, reaching his helmet down from a
peg. “What’s your name, sonny, and where do you live?”

Sonny affirmed, with apparent reluctance, that his name was Samuel
Hooper and that his abode was situated in Foul Anchor Alley; and when
these facts had been committed to writing by the sergeant, the latter
put on his helmet and invited the said Hooper to “come along,”
evidently assuming that I was to form one of the party.

As we approached the office this time I saw Bundy from afar off; and
by the time we were abreast of the house he was joined by Japp, who
must have stood upon tip-toe to bring his eyes above the curtain. Both
men watched us with intense interest, and we had barely passed the
house when Bundy’s head suddenly disappeared, and a few moments later
its owner emerged from the doorway and hurriedly crossed the road.

“What is in the wind, Doctor?” he asked, as he came up with us. “Japp
is in a rare twitter. Have they found the body?”

“No,” I answered; “only the little box that was in her hand-bag. We
are going to have a look at the place where it was found.”

“To see if the bag is there, too?” said he. “It probably is, unless it
has been picked up already. I think I’ll come along with you, if you
don’t object. Then I can give Japp all the news.”

I did not object, nor did the sergeant--verbally; but his expression
conveyed to me that he would willingly have dispensed with Mr. Bundy’s
society. However, he was a suave and tactful man, and he made the best
of the unwelcome addition to the party, even going so far as to offer
the box for Bundy’s inspection.

“It is pretty dirty,” the latter observed, holding it delicately in
his fingers. “Wasn’t it wrapped in paper when you gave it to her,
Doctor?”

“It was wrapped up in paper when I found it,” said Hooper, “but I took
off the paper to see what was inside, and, yer see, my ’ands wasn’t
very clean, a-grubbin’ about in the mud.” In conclusive confirmation
of this statement, he exhibited them to us, and then gave them a
perfunctory wipe on his trousers.

“What struck me,” said Bundy, “was that it doesn’t seem to have been
in the water.”

“It hadn’t,” said Hooper. “The outside paper was quite clean when I
picked it up.”

“It looks,” observed the sergeant, “as if they had turned out the bag
and thrown away what they didn’t want; and then they probably threw
away the bag, too. It is ten chances to one that it has been picked
up, but if it hasn’t it will probably be somewhere along the
high-water mark. How are the tides, Hooper?”

“Just past the bottom of the nips,” was the reply; and a few moments
later our guide added: “It’s down here,” and plunged into what looked
like an open doorway. We followed, one at a time, cautiously
descending a flight of very filthy stone steps and stooping to avoid
knocking our heads against the overhanging story of an ancient timber
house. At the bottom we proceeded, still in single file, along a
narrow, crooked passage between grimy walls and ruinous tarred fences
until, after many twistings and turnings, we came to a flight of rough
wooden steps, thickly coated with yellow mud and slimy sea-grass,
which led down to the shore.

“Now,” said the sergeant, turning up the bottoms of his trousers,
“show us exactly where you picked the box up.”

“It was just oppersight that there schooner,” said our guide, taking
his way along the muddy streak between the two lines of jetsam that
corresponded to the springtide and neap-tide high-water marks;
“betwixt her and the wharf.”

We followed him, picking our way daintily, and, having inspected the
spot that he indicated, squeezed in between the schooner’s bilge and
the piles and raked over the rubbish that the tide had deposited on
the shore.

“Was you looking for anything in partickler?” Hooper asked.

“We are looking for a small leather handbag,” replied the sergeant,
“or anything else we can find.”

“A ’and-bag wouldn’t ’ave been ’ere long,” Hooper remarked. “Somebody
would ’ave twigged it pretty quick, unless it got hidden under
something big.” He straightened himself up and gave a searching look
up and down the shore; and then suddenly he started off with an air of
definite purpose. Glancing in the direction towards which he was
shaping his course, I observed, in the corner of a stage that jutted
out from the quay, a heap of miscellaneous rubbish surmounted by the
mortal remains of a large hamper. It looked a likely spot and we all
followed, though not at his pace, being somewhat more fastidious as to
where we stepped. Consequently he arrived considerably before us, and
having flung away the hamper, began eagerly to grub among the
underlying raffle. Just as we had come within a dozen yards of him,
anxiously making the perilous passage over a stretch of peculiarly
slimy mud, he stood up with a howl of triumph, and we all stopped to
look at him. His arm was raised above his head, and from his hand hung
by its handle a little morocco bag.

“There’s no need to ask you to identify it, Doctor,” said the
sergeant, as he despoiled the water-rat of his prize. “It fits your
description to a T.”

Nevertheless, he handed it to me, drawing my attention to the initials
“A. F.” stamped on the leather. I turned it over gloomily, noting that
it showed signs of having been in the water--though not, apparently,
for any considerable time--and that none of its contents remained
excepting a handkerchief tucked into an inner pocket, and returned it
to him without remark.

“Now, look here, Hooper,” said he, “I want you to stay down here and
keep an eye on this shore until I send some of our men up, and then
you can stay and help them, if you like. And remember that anything
that you find--no matter what it is--you keep and hand over to me or
my men; and you will be paid the full value and a reward for finding
it as well. Do you understand that?”

“I do,” replied Hooper. “That’s a fair orfer, and you can depend on me
to do the square thing. I’ll stay down here until your men come.”

Thereupon we left him, pursuing our way along the shore and keeping an
attentive eye on all the rubbish and litter that we passed, until we
came to a set of rough wooden steps by the Ship Pier.

“I had no authority to offer to pay that chap,” said the sergeant, as
we walked up Ship Alley, “but the superintendent has put me on to work
at this case, and I’m not going to lose any chances for the sake of a
few shillings. It is well to keep in with these waterside people.”

“Have you published a list of things that are likely to turn up?”
Bundy asked.

“We’ve posted up a description of the missing woman with full details
of her dress and belongings,” replied the sergeant. “But perhaps a
list of the things that might be washed up would be useful. People are
such fools. Yes, it’s a good idea. I’ll have a list printed of
everything that might get loose and be picked up, and stick it up on
the wharves and waterside premises. Then there will be nothing left to
their imagination.”

At the top of Ship Alley he halted, and having thanked me warmly for
my prompt and timely information, turned towards Chatham Town, leaving
me and Bundy to retrace our steps westward.

“That was a bit of luck,” the latter remarked, “finding that bag; and
he hardly deserved it. He ought to have had that piece of shore under
observation from the first. But he was wise to make an acceptable
offer to that body-snatcher, Hooper. I expect he lives on the shore,
watching for derelict corpses and any unconsidered trifles that the
river may throw up. I see there is a reward of two pounds for the
body.”

“You have seen the bills, then?”

“Yes. We have got one to stick up in the office window. Rather
gruesome, isn’t it?”

“Horrible,” I said; and for a while we walked on in silence. Presently
Bundy exclaimed: “By Jove! I had nearly forgotten. I have a message
for you. It is from Japp. He is taking a distinguished American
archæologist for a personally conducted tour round the town to show
him the antiquities, and he thought you might like to join the party.”

“That is very good of him,” said I. “It sounds as if it should be
rather interesting.”

“It will be,” said Bundy. “Japp is an enthusiast in regard to
architecture and ancient buildings, and he is quite an authority on
the antiquities of this town. You’d better come. The American--his
name is Willard--is going to charter a photographer to come round with
us and take records of all the objects of interest, and we shall be
able to get copies of any photographs that we want. What do you say?”

“When does the demonstration take place?”

“The day after to-morrow. We shall do the Cathedral in the morning and
the castle and the town in the afternoon. Shall I tell Japp you will
join the merry throng?”

“Yes, please; and convey my very warm thanks for the invitation.”

“I will,” said he, halting as we arrived at the office, “unless you
would like to come in and convey the joyful tidings yourself.”

“No,” he replied, “I won’t come in now. I will get home and change my
boots.”

“Yes, by Jingo!” Bundy agreed, with a rueful glance at his own
delicate shoes. “Mudlarking calls for a special outfit. And I clean my
own shoes; but I’d rather do that than face Mrs. Dunk.”

With this he retired up the steps, and I turned homeward, deciding to
profit by his last remark and forestall unfavourable comment by
shedding my boots on the doormat.




 CHAPTER X.
 WHICH DEALS WITH ANCIENT MONUMENTS
 AND A BLUE BOAR

On arriving home, I found awaiting me a letter from Dr. Thorndyke
suggesting--in response to a general invitation that I had given him
some time previously--that he should come down on Saturday to spend
the week-end with me. Of course, I adopted the suggestion with very
great pleasure, not a little flattered at receiving so distinguished a
guest; and now I was somewhat disposed to regret my engagement to
attend Mr. Japp’s demonstration. However, as Thorndyke was not due
until lunch time, I should have an opportunity of modifying my
arrangement, if necessary.

But, as events turned out, I congratulated myself warmly on not having
missed the morning visit to the Cathedral. It was a really remarkable
experience; and not the least interesting part of it to me was the
revelation of the inner personality of my friend, Mr. Japp. That
usually dry and taciturn man of business was transfigured in the
presence of the things that he really loved. He glowed with
enthusiasm; he exhaled the very spirit of mediæval romance; at every
pore he exuded strange and recondite knowledge. Obedient to his
behest, the ancient building told the vivid story of its venerable
past, presented itself in its rude and simple beginnings; exhibited
the transformations that had marked the passing centuries; peopled
itself with the illustrious departed, whose heirs we were and whose
resting-places we looked upon; and became to us a living thing whose
birth and growth we could watch, whose vicissitudes and changing
conditions we could trace until they brought us to its august old age.
Under his guidance we looked down the long vista of the past, from the
time when simple masons scalloped the Norman capitals within, while
illustrious craftsmen fashioned the wonderful west doorway, to that
last upheaval that swept away the modern shoddy and restored to the
old fabric its modest comeliness.

Architectural antiquities, however, are not the especial concern of
this history, though they were not without a certain influence in its
unfolding. Accordingly, I shall not follow our progress--attended by
the indispensable photographic recording angel--through nave and
aisles, form choir to transepts, and from tower to undercroft. At the
close of a delightful morning I betook myself homeward, charged with
new and varied knowledge, and with a cordial invitation to my guest to
join the afternoon’s expedition if he were archæologically inclined.

Apparently he was, for when, shortly after his arrival, I conveyed the
invitation to him he accepted at once.

“I always take the opportunity,” said he, “of getting what is
practically first-hand information. Your friend, Mr. Japp, is
evidently an enthusiast; he has expert technical knowledge, and he has
apparently filled in his detail by personal investigation. A man like
that can tell you more in an hour than guide-books could tell you in a
lifetime. We had better get a large-scale map of the town to enable us
to follow the description, unless you have one.”

“I haven’t,” said I, “but we can get one on the way to the rendezvous.
You got my report, I suppose?”

“Yes,” he replied, “I got it yesterday. That, in fact, was what
determined me to come down. The discovery of that bag upon the shore
dispels to some extent the ambiguity of our data. The finding of the
brooch did not enlighten us much. It might simply have been dropped
and picked up by some casual wayfarer. In fact, that is what the
appearances suggested, for it is manifestly improbable that a person
who had committed a crime would take the risk of pawning the product
of robbery with violence in the very neighbourhood where the crime had
been committed, and after an interval of time which would allow of the
hue and cry having already been raised. Your sergeant is probably
right in assuming that the man with the mole had nothing to do with
the affair. But the finding of this bag is a different matter. It
connects that disappearance with the river and it offers a strong
suggestion of crime.”

“Don’t you think it possible that she might have fallen into the river
accidentally?” I asked.

“It is possible,” he admitted. “But that is where the significance of
the brooch comes in. If she had fallen into the river from some wharf
or pier, there does not seem to be any reason why the brooch should
have become detached and fallen on land--as it apparently did. The
finding of the bag where it had been thrown up by the river, and of
the brooch on shore, suggests a struggle on land previous to the fall
into the water. You don’t happen, I suppose, to know what the bag
contained?”

“I don’t--excepting the packet of tablets that I gave her. When the
bag was found, it was empty; at least, it contained only the
handkerchief, as I mentioned in my report.”

“Yes,” he said reflectively. “By the way, I must compliment you on
those reports. They are excellent, and with regard to this one, there
are two or three rather curious circumstances. First, as to the packet
of tablets. You mention that it had not been unwrapped and that, when
it was found, the paper was quite clean. Therefore it had never been
in the water. Therefore it had been taken out of the bag--by somebody
with moderately clean hands--before the latter was dropped into the
river; and it must have been thrown away on the shore above high-water
mark. Incidentally, since the disappearance occurred--presumably--on
the evening of the 26th of April, and the packet was found on the 7th
of May, it had been lying on the shore for a full ten days. Perhaps
there is nothing very remarkable in that; but the point is that Mrs.
Frood was carrying the bag in her hand and she would almost certainly
have dropped it if there had been any struggle. How, then, did the bag
come to be in the river, and how came some of its contents to be found
on the shore clean and free from any traces of submersion?”

“We can only suppose,” said I, with an inward shudder--for the
discussion of these hideous details made my very flesh creep--“that
the murderer picked up the bag when he had thrown the body into the
river, took out any articles of value, if there were any, and threw
the rest on the shore.”

“Yes,” agreed Thorndyke, a little doubtfully, “that would seem to be
what happened. And in that case, we should have to assume that the
place where the packet was found was, approximately, the place where
the crime was committed. For, as the packet was never immersed, it
could not have been carried to that place by the tide, and one cannot
think of any other agency by which it could have been moved. Its clean
and unopened condition seems to exclude human agency. The question
then naturally arises, Is the place where the packet was found, a
place at, or near, which the tragedy could conceivably have occurred?
What do you say to that?”

I considered for a few moments, recalling the intricate and obscure
approach of the shore and the absence of anything in the nature of a
public highway.

“I can only say,” I replied at length, “that it seems perfectly
inconceivable that Mrs. Frood could have been at that place, or even
near it, unless she went there for some specific purpose--unless, for
instance, she were lured there in some way. It is a place that is, I
should say, unknown to any but the waterside people.”

“We must go there and examine the place carefully,” said he, “for if
it is, as you say, a place to which no one could imaginably have
strayed by chance, that fact has an important evidential bearing.”

“Do you think it quite impossible that the package could have been
carried to that place and dropped there?”

“Not impossible, of course,” he replied, “but I can think of no
reasonably probable way in which it could have happened, supposing the
murderer to have pocketed it, and afterwards to have thrown it away.
That would be a considered and deliberate act; and it is almost
inconceivable that he should not have opened the packet to see what
was inside, and that he should have dropped it on the dry beach when
the river was close at hand. Remember that the bag was found quite
near, and that it had been in the water.”

“And assuming the crime to have been committed at that place, what
would it prove?”

“In the first place,” he replied, “it would pretty definitely exclude
the theory of accidental death. Then it would suggest at least a
certain amount of premeditation, since the victim would have had, as
you say, to be enticed to that unlikely spot. And it would suggest
that the murderer was a person acquainted with the locality.”

“One of the waterside people,” said I. “They are a pretty shady lot,
but I don’t see why any of them should want to murder her.”

“It is not impossible,” said he. “She was said to be shopping in
Chatham, and she might have had a well-filled purse and allowed it to
be seen. But that is mere speculation. The fact is that we have no
data at present. We know practically nothing about Mrs. Frood. We
can’t say if she had any secret enemies, or if there was anyone who
might have profited by her death or have had any motive for making
away with her.”

“We know something about her husband,” said I, “and that he has
disappeared in a rather mysterious fashion; and that his disappearance
coincides with that of his wife.”

“Yes,” Thorndyke agreed, “those are significant facts. But we mustn’t
lose sight of the legal position. Until the body is recovered, there
is no evidence of death. Until the death is proved, no charge of
murder can be sustained. When the body is found it will probably
furnish some evidence as to how the death occurred, if it is recovered
within a reasonable time. As a matter of fact, it is rather remarkable
that it has not yet been found. The death occurred--presumably--nearly
a fortnight ago. Considering how very much frequented this river is,
it is really rather unaccountable that the body has not come to light.
But I suppose it is time that we started for the rendezvous.”

I looked at my watch and decided that it was, and we accordingly set
forth in the direction of the office, which was the appointed
meeting-place, calling at a stationer’s to provide ourselves each with
a map. We chose the six-inch town plan, which contained the whole
urban area, including the winding reaches of the river, folding them
so as to show at an opening the peninsula on which the city of
Rochester is built.

“A curious loop of the river, this,” said Thorndyke, scanning the map
as we went along. “Rather like that of the Thames at the Isle of Dogs.
You notice that there are quite a number of creeks on the low shore at
both sides. Those will be places to watch. A floating body has rather
a tendency to get carried into shallow creeks and to stay there. But I
have no doubt the longshoremen are keeping an eye on them as a reward
has been offered. Perhaps we might be able to go down and have a look
at the shore when we have finished our perambulation of the town.”

“I don’t see why not,” I replied, though, to tell the truth, I was not
very keen on this particular exploration. To Thorndyke this quest was
just an investigation to be pursued with passionless care and method.
To me it was a tragedy that would colour my whole life. To him,
Angelina was but a missing woman whose disappearance had to be
explained by patient inquiry. To me she was a beloved friend whose
loss would leave me with a life-long sorrow. Of course, he was not
aware of this; he had no suspicion of the shuddering horror that his
calm, impersonal examination of the evidential details produced in me.
Nor did I intend that he should. It was my duty and my privilege to
give him what assistance I could, and keep my emotions to myself.

“You will bear in mind,” said he, as we approached the office, “that
my connexion with the case of Mrs. Frood is not to be referred to. I
am simply a friend staying with you for a day or two.”

“I won’t forget,” said I, “though I don’t quite see why it should
matter.”

“It probably doesn’t matter at all,” he replied. “But one never knows.
Facts which might readily be spoken of before a presumably
disinterested person might be withheld from one who was known to be
collecting evidence for professional purposes. At any rate, I make it
a rule to keep out of sight as far as possible.”

These observations brought us to the office, where we found our three
friends together with a young man, who was apparently acting as deputy
during the absence of the partners, and the photographer. I presented
Thorndyke to my friends, and when the introduction had been made Mr.
Japp picked up his hat, and turned to the deputy.

“You know where to find me, Stevens,” he said, “if I should be really
wanted--really, you understand. But I don’t particularly want to be
found. Shall we start now? I propose to begin at the bridge, follow
the High-street as far as Eastgate House, visit Restoration House,
trace the city wall on the southwest side, and look over the castle.
By that time we shall be ready for tea. After tea we can trace the
north-east part of the wall and the gates that opened through it, and
that will finish our tour of inspection.”

Hereupon the procession started, Mr. Japp and his guest leading,
Thorndyke, Bundy, and I following, and the photographer bringing up
the rear.

“Let me see,” said Bundy, looking up at Thorndyke with a sort of pert
shyness, “weren’t you down here a week or two ago?”

“Yes,” replied Thorndyke; “and I think I had the honour of being
inspected by you while I was reading your proclamation respecting a
certain lost key.”

“You had,” said Bundy; “in fact, I may say that you raised false hopes
in my partner and me. We thought you were going to find it.”

“What, for ten shillings!” exclaimed Thorndyke.

“We would have raised the fee if you had made a firm offer,” said
Bundy, removing his eyeglass to polish it with his handkerchief. “It
was a valuable key. Belonged to a gate that encloses part of the city
wall.”

“Indeed!” said Thorndyke. “I don’t wonder you were anxious about it
considering what numbers of dishonest persons there are about. Ha!
Here is the bridge. Let us hear what Mr. Japp has to say about it.”

Mr. Japp’s observations were concise. Having cast a venomous glance at
the unlovely structure, he turned his back on it and remarked acidly:

“That is the new bridge. It is, as you see, composed of iron girders.
It is not an antiquity, and I hope it never will be. Let us forget it
and go on to the Guildhall.” He strode forward doggedly and Bundy
turned to us with a grin.

“Poor old Japp,” said he, “he does hate that bridge. He has an
engraving of the old stone one in his rooms, and I’ve seen him stand
in front of it and groan. And really you can’t wonder. It is an awful
come-down. Just think what the town must have looked like from across
the river when that stone bridge was standing.”

Here we halted opposite the Guildhall, and when we had read the
inscription, admired the magnificent ship weather-cock--said to be a
model of the Rodney--and listened to Japp’s observations on the
architectural features of the building, the photographer was
instructed to operate on its exterior while we entered to explore the
Justice Room and examine the portraits. From the Guildhall we passed
on to the Corn Exchange, the quaint and handsome overhanging clock of
which had evidently captured Mr. Willard’s fancy.

“That clock,” said he, “is a stroke of genius. It gives a character to
the whole street. But what in creation induced your City Fathers to
allow that charming little building to be turned into a picture
theatre?”

Japp shook his head and groaned. “You may well ask that,” said he,
glaring viciously at the inane posters and the doorway, decorated in
the film taste. “If good Sir Cloudesley Shovel, who gave it to the
town, could rise from his grave and look at it, now he’d--bah! The
crying need of this age is some means of protecting historic buildings
from town councils. To these men an ancient building is just
old-fashioned--out-of-date; a thing to be pulled down and replaced by
something smart and up-to-date in the corrugated iron line.” He
snorted fiercely, and as the photographer dismounted his camera, he
turned and led the way up the street. I lingered to help the
photographer with his repacking, and meanwhile Thorndyke and Bundy
walked on together, chatting amicably and suggesting to my fancy an
amiable mastiff accompanied by a particularly well-groomed fox
terrier.

“Do you usually give your patients a week-end holiday?” Bundy was
inquiring as I overtook them.

“I haven’t any patients,” replied Thorndyke. “My medical practice is
conducted mostly in the Law Courts.”

“Good gracious!” exclaimed Bundy. “Do you mean that you live by
resuscitating moribund jurymen and fattening up murderers for
execution, and that sort of thing?”

“Not at all,” replied Thorndyke. “Nothing so harmless. I am what is
known as a Medical Expert. I give opinions on medical questions that
affect legal issues.”

“Then you are really a sort of lawyer?”

“Yes. A medico-legal hybrid; a sort of centaur or merman, with a
doctor’s head and a lawyer’s tail.”

“Well,” said Bundy, “there are some queer professions. I once knew a
chap in the furniture trade who described himself as a
‘worm-eater’--drilled worm-holes in faked antiques, you know.”

“And what,” asked Thorndyke, “might be the analogy that you are
suggesting? You don’t propose to associate me with the diet of worms,
I hope.”

“Certainly not,” said Bundy, “though I suppose your practice is
sometimes connected with exhumations. But I was thinking that you must
know quite a lot about crime.”

“A good deal of my practice is concerned with criminal cases,”
Thorndyke admitted.

“Then you will be rather interested in our local mystery. Has the
doctor told you about it?”

“You mean the mystery of the disappearing lady? But of what interest
should it be to me? I was not acquainted with her.”

“I meant a professional interest. But I suppose you are not taking a
’bus-man’s holiday: don’t want to be bothered with mysteries that
don’t concern you. Still, I should like to hear your expert opinion on
the case.”

“You mistake my functions,” said Thorndyke. “A common witness
testifies to facts known to himself. An expert witness interprets
facts presented to him by others. Present me your facts, and I will
try to give you an interpretation of them.”

“But there are no facts. That is what constitutes the mystery.”

“Then there is nothing to interpret. It is a case for the police, and
not for the scientific expert.”

Here our conversation was interrupted by our arrival at the House of
the Six Poor Travellers, and by a learned disquisition by Japp on the
connotation of the word Proctor--which, it appeared, was sometimes
used in the Middle Ages in the sense of a cadger or swindler. Thence
we proceeded to Eastgate House, where Japp mounted his hobby and
discoursed impressively on the subject of ceilings, taking as his text
a specimen modelled _in situ_, and bearing the date 1590.

“The fellow who put up that ceiling,” said he, “took his time about
it, no doubt. But his work has lasted three hundred and fifty years.
That is the best way to save time. Your modern plasterer will have his
ceiling up in a jiffy; and it will be down in a jiffy, and to do all
over again. And never worth looking at at all.”

Mr. Willard nodded. “It is very true,” said he. “What is striking me
in looking at all this old work is the great economy of time that is
effected by taking pains and using good material, to say nothing of
the beauty of the things created.”

“If he goes on talking like that,” whispered Bundy, “Japp’ll kiss him.
We must get them out of this.”

Mercifully--if such a catastrophe was imminent--the ceiling discourse
brought our inspection here to an end. From Eastgate House we went
back to the Maidstone-road, and when we had inspected Restoration
House, began to trace out the site of the city wall, which Thorndyke
carefully marked on his map, to Japp’s intense gratification. This
perambulation brought us to the castle--which was dealt with rather
summarily, as Mr. Willard had already examined it--and we then
returned to the office for tea, which Bundy prepared and served with
great success in his own sitting-room, while Japp dotted in with red
ink on Thorndyke’s map the entire city wall, including the part which
we had yet to trace; and ridiculously small the ancient city looked
when thus marked out on the modern town.

After tea we retraced our steps to the site of the East Gate, and,
having inspected a large fragment of the wall at the end of an alley,
traced its line across the High-street, and then proceeded down Free
School-lane to the fine angle-bastion at the northern corner of the
lane. Thence we followed the scanty indications as far as the site of
the North Gate, and thereafter through a confused and rather unlovely
neighbourhood until, on the edge of the marshes, we struck into a
narrow lane, enclosed by a dilapidated tarred fence, a short distance
along which we came to a closed gate, which I recognized as the one
through which I had passed with Bundy on the day when we were made
acquainted with the tragic history of Bill the Bargee. As Japp
unlocked the gate and admitted us to the space of waste land, Bundy
remarked to Thorndyke: “That is the gate that the missing key belonged
to. You see there is no harm done so far. The wall is still there.”

“Yes,” said Thorndyke, “and not much improved in appearance by your
builders’ attentions. Those patches suggest the first attempts of an
untalented dental student at conservation.”

“They are rather a disfigurement,” said Japp. “But the men had to have
a job found for them, and that is the result. Perhaps they won’t show
so much in the photograph.”

While the photographer was setting up his camera and making the
exposure, Japp explained the relation of this piece of wall to the
North Gate and the Gate that faced the bridge, and marked its position
on Thorndyke’s map.

“And that,” he continued, “concludes our perambulation. The
photographer is chartered by Mr. Willard, but I understand that we are
at liberty to secure copies of the photographs, if we want them. Is
that not so, Mr. Willard?”

“Surely,” was the cordial reply; “only I stipulate that they shall be
a gift from me, and I shall ask a favour in return. If there is a
plate left, I should like to have a commemorative group taken, so that
when I recall this pleasant day, I can also recall the pleasant
society in which I spent it.”

We all acknowledged the kindly compliment with a bow, and as the
photographer announced that he had a spare plate, we grouped ourselves
against a portion of undisfigured wall, removed our hats, and took up
easy and graceful postures on either side of Mr. Willard. When the
exposure had been made, and the photographer proceeded to pack up his
apparatus, Thorndyke tendered his very hearty thanks to Mr. Japp and
his friend for their hospitality.

“It has been a great privilege,” said he, “to be allowed to share in
the products of so much study and research, and I assure you it is far
from being unappreciated. Whenever I revisit Rochester--which I hope
to do before long--I shall think of you gratefully, and of your very
kind and generous friend, Mr. Willard.”

Our two hosts made suitable acknowledgments; and while these
compliments were passing, I turned to Bundy.

“Can we get down to the shore from here?” I asked. “Thorndyke was
saying that he would like to have a look at the river. If it is
accessible from here we might take it on the way home.”

“It isn’t difficult to get at,” replied Bundy. “If he wants to get a
typical view of the river with the below-bridge traffic, by far the
best place is Blue Boar Pier. It isn’t very far, and it is on your way
home--more or less. I’ll show you the way there if you like. Japp is
dining with Willard, so he won’t want me.”

I accepted the offer gladly, and as the exchange of compliments seemed
to be completed and our party was moving towards the gate, I tendered
my thanks for the day’s entertainment and bade my hosts farewell,
explaining that we were going riverwards. Accordingly we parted at the
gate, Japp and Willard turning towards the town, while Thorndyke,
Bundy, and I retraced our steps towards the marshes.

At the bottom of the lane Bundy paused to explain the topography.
“That path,” said he, “leads to Gas House-road and the marshes by the
North Shore. But there isn’t much to see there. If we take this other
track we shall strike Blue Boar-lane, which will take us to the pier.
From there we can get a view of the whole bend of the river right
across to Chatham.”

Thorndyke followed the description closely with the aid of his map,
marking off our present position with a pencil. Then we struck into a
rough cart-track, with the wide stretch of the marshes on our left,
and, following this, we presently came out into the lower part of Blue
Boar-lane and turned our faces towards the river. We had not gone far
when I observed a man approaching whose appearance seemed to be
familiar. Bundy also observed him, for he exclaimed: “Why, that is old
Cobbledick! Out of uniform, too. Very irregular. I shall have to
remonstrate with him. I wonder what he has been up to. Prowling about
the river bank in search of clues, I expect. And he’ll suspect us of
being on the same errand.”

Bundy’s surmise appeared to be correct, for as the sergeant drew
nearer and recognized us, his face took on an expression of shrewd
inquiry. But I noticed with some surprise that his curiosity seemed to
be principally concerned with Thorndyke, at whom he gazed with
something more than common attention. Under the circumstances I should
have passed him with a friendly greeting, but he stopped, and, having
wished me “Good evening,” said: “Could I have a few words with you,
Doctor?” upon which I halted, and Thorndyke and Bundy walked on
slowly. The sergeant looked after them, and, turning his back to them,
drew from his pocket with a mysterious air a small dirty brown bundle,
which he handed to me.

“I wanted you just to have a look at that,” he said.

I opened out the bundle, though I had already tentatively recognized
it. But when it was unrolled it was unmistakable. It was poor
Angelina’s scarf.

“I thought there couldn’t be any doubt about it,” the sergeant said
cheerfully when I had announced the identification. “Your description
was so clear and exact. Well, this gives us a pretty fair kick-off.
You can see that it has been in the water--some time, too. So we know
where to look for the body. The mysterious thing is, though, that
we’ve still got to look for it. It ought to have come up on the shore
days ago. And it hasn’t. There isn’t a longshoreman for miles up and
down that isn’t on the look-out for it. You can see them prowling
along the sea-walls and searching the creeks in their boats. I can’t
think how they can have missed it. The thing is getting serious.”

“Serious?” I repeated.

“Well,” he explained, “there’s no need for me to point out to a
medical gentleman like you that bodies don’t last for ever, especially
in mild weather such as we’ve been having, and in a river where the
shore swarms with rats and shore-crabs. Every day that passes is
making the identification more difficult.”

The horrible suggestions that emerged from his explanation gave me a
sensation of physical sickness. I fidgeted uneasily, but still I
managed to rejoin huskily: “There’s the clothing, you know.”

“So there is,” he agreed; “and very good means of identification in an
ordinary case--accidental drowning, for instance. But this is a
criminal case. I don’t want to have to depend on the clothing.”

“Was the scarf found floating?” I asked, a little anxious to change
the subject to one less gruesome.

“No,” he replied. “It was on the shore by the small creek just below
Blue Boar Pier, under an empty fish-trunk. One of the Customs men from
the watch-house found it. He noticed the trunk lying out on the shore
as he was walking along and went out to see if there was anything in
it. Then, when he found it was empty, he turned it over, and there was
the scarf. He recognized it at once--there’s a list of the articles
stuck up on the watch-house--and kept it to bring to me. But it
happened that I came down here--as I do every day--just after he’d
found it. But I mustn’t keep you here talking, though I’m glad I met
you and got your confirmation about this scarf.”

He smiled benignly and raised his hat, whereupon I wished him “Good
evening” and went on my way with a sigh of relief. He was a pleasant,
genial man, but his matter-of-fact way of looking at this tragedy that
had eaten so deeply into my peace of mind, was to me positively
harrowing. But, of course, he did not understand my position in the
case.

“Well,” said Bundy, when I hurried up, “what’s the news? Old
Cobbledick was looking mighty mysterious. And wasn’t he interested in
us? Why he’s gazing after us still. Has he had a bite? Because if he
hasn’t, I have. Some beastly mosquito.”

“Don’t rub it,” said Thorndyke, as Bundy clapped his hand to his
cheek. “Leave it alone. We’ll put a spot of ammonia or iodine on it
presently.”

“Very well,” replied Bundy, with a grimace expressive of resignation.
“I am in the hands of the Faculty. What sort of fish was it that Isaak
Walton Cobbledick had hooked? Or is it a secret?”

“I don’t think there is any secrecy about it,” said I. “One of the
Customs men has found Mrs. Frood’s scarf,” and I repeated what the
sergeant had told me as to the circumstances.

“It is a gruesome affair,” said Bundy, “this search for these ghastly
relics. Look at those ghouls down on the shore there. I suppose that
is the fish-trunk.”

As he spoke, we came out on the shore to the right of the pier and
halted to survey the rather unlovely prospect. Outside the stunted
sea-wall a level stretch of grey-green grass extended to the spring
high-water mark, beyond which a smooth sheet of mud--now dry and
covered with multitudinous cracks--spread out to the slimy domain of
the ordinary tides. At the edge of the dry mud lay a derelict
fish-trunk around which a group of bare-legged boys had gathered--and
all along the shore, on the faded grass, on the dry mud and wading in
the soft slime, the human water-rats were to be seen, turning over
drift-rubbish, prying under stranded boats or grubbing in the soft
mud. Hard by, on the grass near the sea-wall, an old ship’s long-boat
had been hauled up above tide-marks to a permanent berth and turned
into a habitation by the erection in it of a small house. A short
ladder gave access to it from without and the resident had laid down a
little causeway of flat stones leading to the wall.

“Mr. Noah seems to be at home,” observed Bundy, as we approached the
little amphibious residence to inspect it. He pointed to a thin wisp
of smoke that issued from the iron chimney; and, almost as he spoke,
the door opened and an old man came out into the open stern-sheets of
the boat with a steaming tin pannikin in his hand. His appearance
fitted his residence to a nicety; for whereas the latter appeared to
have been constructed chiefly from driftwood and wreckage, his costume
suggested a collection of assorted marine salvage, with a leaning
towards oil-skin.

“Mr. Noah” cast a malevolent glance at the searchers; then, having
fortified himself with a pull at the pannikin, he turned a filmy blue
eye on us.

“Good evening,” said Thorndyke. “There seems to be a lot of business
doing here,” and he indicated the fish-trunk and the eager searchers.

The old man grunted contemptuously. “Parcel of fules,” said he,
“a-busyin’ theirselves with what don’t concern ’em, and lookin’ in the
wrong place at that.”

“Still,” said Bundy, “they have found something here.”

“Yes,” the old man admitted, “they have. And that’s why they ain’t
goin’ to find anything more.” He refreshed himself with a drink
of--presumably--tea, and continued: “But the things is a-beginning to
come up. It’s about time she come up. But she won’t come up here.”

“Where do you suppose she will come up?” asked Bundy.

The old man regarded him with a cunning leer. “Never you mind where
she’ll come up,” said he. “It ain’t no consarn o’ yourn.”

“But how do you know where she’ll come up?” Bundy persisted.

“I knows,” the old scarecrow replied conclusively, “becos I do. Becos
I gets my livin’ along-shore, and it’s my business for to know.”

Having made this pronouncement, Mr. Noah looked inquiringly into the
pannikin, emptied it at a draught, and, turning abruptly, retired into
the ark, shutting the door after him with a care suited to its evident
physical infirmity.

“I wonder if he really does know,” said Bundy, as we walked away past
the Customs watch-house.

“We can fairly take it that he doesn’t,” said Thorndyke, “seeing that
the matter is beyond human calculation. But I have no doubt that he
knows the places where bodies and other floating objects are most
commonly washed ashore, and we may assume that he is proposing to
devote his probably extensive leisure to the exploration of those
places. It wouldn’t be amiss to put the sergeant in communication with
him.”

“Probably the sergeant knows him,” said I, “but I will mention the
matter the next time I see him.”

At the top of Blue Boar-lane Bundy halted and held out his hand to
Thorndyke. “This is the parting of the ways,” said he.

“Oh, no, it isn’t,” replied Thorndyke. “You’ve got to have your
mosquito-bite treated. Never neglect an insect-bite, especially on the
face.”

“As a matter of fact,” said I, “you have got to come and have dinner
with us. We can’t let you break up the party in this way.”

“It’s very nice of you to ask me,” he began, hesitatingly, a little
shy, as I guessed, of intruding on me and my visitor; but I cut him
short, and, hooking my arm through his, led him off, an obviously
willing captive. And if his presence hindered me from discussing with
Thorndyke the problem that had occasioned his visit, that was of no
consequence, since we should have the following day to ourselves; and
he certainly contributed not a little to the cheerfulness of the
proceedings. Indeed, I seemed to find in his high spirits something a
little pathetic; a suggestion that the company of two live men--one of
them a man of outstanding intellect--was an unusual treat, and that
his life with old Japp and the predatory females might be a trifle
dull. He took to Thorndyke amazingly, treating him with a sort of
respectful cheekiness, like a schoolboy dining with a favourite
head-master; while Thorndyke, fully appreciative of his irresponsible
gaiety, developed a quiet humour and playfulness which rather took me
by surprise. The solemn farce of the diagnosis and treatment of the
mosquito bite was an instance; when Thorndyke, having seated the
patient in the surgery chair and invested him with a large towel,
covered the table with an assortment of preposterous instruments and
bottles of reagents, and proceeded gravely to examine the bite through
a lens until Bundy was as nervous as a cat, and then to apply the
remedy with meticulous precision on the point of a fine sable brush.

It was a pleasant evening, pervaded by a sense of frivolous gaiety
that was felt gratefully by the two elder revellers and was even
viewed indulgently by Mrs. Dunk. As to Bundy, his high spirits flowed
unceasingly--but, I may add, with faultless good manners--and when, at
length, he took his departure, he shook our hands with a warmth which,
again, I found slightly pathetic.

“I _have_ had a jolly evening!” he exclaimed, looking at me with a
queer sort of wistfulness. “It has been a red-letter day”; and with
this he turned abruptly and walked away.

We watched him from the threshold, bustling jauntily along the
pavement; and as I looked at him, there came unbidden to my mind the
recollection of that other figure that I had watched from this same
threshold, walking away in the fading light--walking into the fog that
was to swallow her up and hide her from my sight for ever.

From these gloomy reflections I was recalled by Thorndyke’s voice.

“A nice youngster, that, Strangeways. Gay and sprightly, but not in
the least shallow. I often think that there was a great deal of wisdom
in that observation of Spencer’s, that happy people are the greatest
benefactors to mankind. Your friend, Bundy, has helped me to renew my
youth; and who could have done one a greater service?”




 CHAPTER XI.
 THE MAN WITH THE MOLE

When I had seen my guest off by the last train on Saturday night, I
walked homeward slowly, cogitating on the results of his visit. It
seemed to me that they were very insignificant. In the morning we had
explored the piece of shore on which the bag and the box of tablets
had been found, making our way to it by the narrow and intricate
alleys which seemed to be the only approach; and we had reached the
same conclusion. It was an impossible place.

“If we assume,” said Thorndyke, “as we must, on the apparent
probabilities, that the tragedy occurred here, we must assume that
there are some significant circumstances that are unknown to us. Mrs.
Frood could not have strayed here by chance. We can think of no
business that could have brought her here; and since she was neither a
child nor a fool, she could not have been enticed into such an
obviously sinister locality without some plausible pretext. There is
evidently something more than meets the eye.”

“Something, you mean, connected with her past life and the people she
knew?”

“Exactly. I am having careful inquiries made on the subject in likely
quarters, including the various theatrical photographers. They form
quite a promising source of information, as they are not only able to
give addresses but they can furnish us with photographs of members of
the companies who would have been colleagues, and, at least,
acquaintances.”

“If you come across any photographs of Mrs. Frood,” I said, “I should
like to see them.”

“You shall,” he replied. “I shall certainly collect all I can get, on
the chance that they may help us with the identification of the body;
which may possibly present some difficulty.”

Here I was reminded of Cobbledick’s observations, and, distasteful as
they were, I repeated them to Thorndyke.

“The sergeant is quite right,” said he. “This is apparently a criminal
case, involving a charge of wilful murder. To sustain that charge, the
prosecution will have to produce incontestable evidence as to the
identity of the deceased. Clothing alone would not be sufficient to
secure a conviction. The body would have to be identified. And the
sergeant’s anxiety is quite justified. Have you had any experiences of
bodies recovered from the water?”

“Yes,” I replied; “and I don’t like to think of them.” I shuddered as
I spoke, for his question had recalled to my memory the incidents of a
professional visit to Poplar Mortuary. There rose before my eyes the
picture of a long black box with a small glass window in the lid, and
of a thing that appeared at that window; a huge, bloated, green and
purple thing, with groups of radiating wrinkles, and in the middle a
button-like object that looked like the tip of a nose. It was a
frightful picture; and yet I knew that when the river that we stood by
should give up its dead----

I put the thought away with a shiver and asked faintly: “About the man
Frood. Don’t you think that his disappearance throws some light on the
mystery?”

“It doesn’t throw much light,” replied Thorndyke, “because nothing is
known about it. Obviously the coincidence in time of the
disappearance, added to the known character of the man and his
relations with his wife, make him an object of deep suspicion. His
whereabouts will have to be traced and his time accounted for. But I
have ascertained that the police know nothing about him, and my own
inquiries have come to nothing, so far. He seems to have disappeared
without leaving a trace. But I shall persevere. Your object--and
mine--is to clear up the mystery, and if a crime has been committed,
to bring the criminal to justice.”

So that was how the matter stood; and it did not appear to me that
much progress had been made towards the elucidation of the mystery. As
to the perpetrator of that crime, he remained a totally unknown
quantity, unless the deed could be fixed on the missing man, Frood.
And so matters remained for some days. Then an event occurred which
seemed to promise some illumination of the darkness; a promise that it
failed to fulfil.

It was about a week after Thorndyke’s visit. I had gone out after
lunch to post off to him the set of photographs which had been
delivered to me by the photographer with my own set. I went into the
post-office to register the package, and here I found Bundy in the act
of sending off a parcel. When we had transacted our business we
strolled out together, and he asked:

“What are you going to do now, Doctor?”

“I was going to walk down to Blue Boar Pier,” said I, “to see if
anything further has been discovered.”

“Should I be in the way if I walked there with you?” he asked. “I’ve
got nothing to do at the moment. But perhaps you would rather go
alone. You’ve had a good deal of my society lately.”

“Not more than I wanted, Bundy,” I answered. “You are my only chum
here, and you are not unappreciated, I can assure you.”

“It’s nice of you to say that,” he rejoined, with some emotion. “I’ve
sometimes felt that I was rather thrusting my friendship on you.”

“Then don’t ever feel it again,” said I. “It has been a bit of luck
for me to find a man here whom I could like and chum in with.”

He murmured a few words of thanks, and we walked on for a while
without speaking. Presently, as we turned into the lane by the Blue
Boar Inn, he said, a little hesitatingly:

“Don’t you think, Doc, that it is rather a mistake to let your mind
run so much on this dreadful affair? It seems to be always in your
thoughts. And it isn’t good for you to think so much about it. I’ve
noticed you quite a lot, and you haven’t been the same since--since it
happened. You have looked worried and depressed.”

“I haven’t felt the same,” said I. “It has been a great grief to me.”

“But,” he urged, “don’t you think you should try to forget it? After
all, she was little more than an acquaintance.”

“She was a great deal more than that, Bundy,” said I. “While she was
alive, I would not admit even to myself that my feeling towards her
was anything more than ordinary friendship. But it was; and now that
she is gone, there can be no harm in recognizing the fact, or even in
confessing it to you, as we are friends.”

“Do you mean, Doc,” he said in a low voice, “that you were in love
with her?”

“That is what it comes to, I suppose,” I answered. “She was the only
woman I had ever really cared for.”

“And did she know it?” he asked.

“Of course she didn’t,” I replied indignantly. “She was a lady and a
woman of honour. Of course she never dreamed that I cared for her, or
she would never have let me visit her.”

For a few moments he walked at my side in silence. Then he slipped his
arm through mine, and pressing it gently with his hand, said softly
and very earnestly: “I’m awfully sorry, Doc. It is frightfully hard
luck for you, though it couldn’t have been much better even if--but
it’s no use talking of that. I _am_ sorry, old chap. But still, you
know, you ought to try to put it away. _She_ wouldn’t have wished you
to make yourself unhappy about her.”

“I know,” said I. “But I feel that the office belongs to me, who cared
most for her, to see that the mystery of her death is cleared up and
that whoever wronged her is brought to justice.”

He made no reply to this but walked at my side with his arm linked in
mine, meditating with an air of unwonted gravity.

When we reached the head of the pier the place was deserted excepting
for one man; a sea-faring person, apparently, who was standing with
his back to us, studying intently the bills that were stuck on the
wall of the look-out. As we were passing, my eye caught the word
“Wanted” on a new bill, and pausing to read it over the man’s
shoulder, I found that it was a description of the unknown man--“with
a mole on the left side of his nose”--who had pawned the opal brooch.
Bundy read it, too, and as we walked away he remarked: “They are
rather late in putting out those bills. I should think that gentleman
will have left the locality long ago, unless he was a local person”;
an opinion with which I was disposed to agree.

After a glance round the shore and at “the Ark”--which was closed but
of which the chimney emitted a cheerful smoke suggestive of culinary
activities on the part of “Mr. Noah”--we sauntered up past the head of
the creek, along the rough path by the foundry, and out upon the upper
shore.

“Well, I’m hanged!” exclaimed Bundy, glancing back at the watch-house,
“that chap is still reading that bill. He must be a mighty slow
reader, or he must find it more thrilling than I did. Perhaps he knows
somebody with a mole on his nose.”

I looked back at the motionless figure; and at that moment another
figure appeared and advanced, as we had done, to look over the
reader’s shoulder.

“Why, that looks like old Cobbledick--come to admire his own literary
productions. There’s vanity for you. Hallo! What’s up now?”

As Bundy spoke, the reader had turned to move away and had come face
to face with the sergeant. For a moment both men had stood stock
still; then there was a sudden, confused movement on both sides, with
the final result that the sergeant fell, or was knocked, down and that
the stranger raced off, apparently in our direction. He disappeared at
once, being hidden from us by the foundry buildings, and we advanced
towards the end of the fenced lane by which we had come, to intercept
him, waiting by the edge of a trench or dry ditch.

“Here he comes,” said Bundy, a trifle nervously, as rapid footfalls
became audible in the narrow, crooked lane. Suddenly the man appeared,
running furiously, and as he caught sight of us, he whipped out a
large knife, and, flourishing it with a menacing air, charged straight
at us. I watched an opportunity to trip him up; but as he approached
Bundy pulled me back with such energy that he and I staggered on the
brink of the ditch, capsized, and rolled together to the bottom. By
the time we had managed to scramble up, the man had disappeared into
the wilderness of sheds, scrap-heaps, derelict boilers, and stray
railway-waggons that filled the area of land between the foundry and
the coal-wharves and jetties.

“Come on, Bundy,” said I, as my companion stood tenderly rubbing
various projecting portions of his person; “we mustn’t lose sight of
him.”

But Bundy showed no enthusiasm; and at this moment a rapid crescendo
of heavy foot-falls was followed by the emergence of the sergeant,
purple-faced and panting, from the end of the lane.

“Which way did he go?” gasped Cobbledick.

I indicated the wilderness, briefly explaining how the fugitive had
escaped us, whereupon the sergeant started forward at a lumbering trot
and we followed. But it was an unfavourable hunting-ground, for the
bulky litter--the heaps of coal-dust, the wagons, the cranes, the
piles of condemned machinery, mingled with clumps of bushes--gave the
fugitive every opportunity to disappear. And, in fact, he had
disappeared without leaving a trace. Presently we came out on a wharf
beside which a schooner was berthed; a trim-looking little craft with
a white under-body and black top-sides, bearing a single big yard on
her fore-mast and the name Anna on her counter. She was all ready for
sea and was apparently waiting for high water, for her deck was all
clear and a man on it was engaged in placidly coiling a rope on the
battened hatch while another watched him from the door of the
deck-house. On this peaceful scene the sergeant burst suddenly and
hailing the rope-coiler demanded:

“Have you seen a man run past here?”

The mariner dropped the rope, and looking up drowsily, repeated:

“Have I seen a mahn?”

“Yes, a sea-faring man with a mole on his nose.”

The mariner brightened up perceptibly. “Please?” said he.

“A sailor-man with a mole on his nose.”

“Ach!” exclaimed the mariner. “Vos it tied on?”

“Tied on!” the sergeant snorted impatiently. “Of course it wasn’t. It
grew there.”

Here the second mariner apparently asked some question, for our friend
turned to him and replied: “_Ja. Maulwurf_”; on which I heard Bundy
snigger softly.

“No, no,” I interposed; “not that sort of mole. A kind of wart, you
know. _Das Mal_.”

On this the second mariner fell out of the deckhouse door, and the
pair burst into yells of laughter, rolling about the deck in agonies
of mirth, wiping their eyes, muttering _Maulwurf_, _Maulwurf_, and
screeching like demented hyenas.

“Well,” Cobbledick demanded impatiently, “have you seen him?”

The mariner shook his head. “No,” he replied, shakily. “I have not any
mahn seen.”

“Well, why couldn’t you say so at first?” the sergeant growled.

“I vos zo zubbraised,” the mariner explained, glancing at his
shipmate; and the pair burst out into fresh howls of laughter.

The sergeant turned away with a sort of benevolent contempt and ran
his eye despairingly over the wilderness. “I suppose we had better
search this place,” said he, “though he is pretty certain to have got
away.”

At his suggestion we separated and examined the possible hiding-places
systematically, but, of course, with no result. Once only I had a
momentary hope that we had not lost our quarry, when the sergeant
suddenly stooped and began cautiously to stalk an abandoned boiler
surrounded by a clump of bushes; but when the grinning countenance of
Bundy appeared at the opposite end and that reprobate crept out
stealthily and proceeded to stalk the sergeant, the last hope faded.

“I certainly thought I saw someone moving in those bushes,” said
Cobbledick, with a disappointed air.

“So did Mr. Bundy,” said I. “You must have seen one another.”

The sergeant glanced suspiciously at our colleague, but made no
remark; and we continued our rather perfunctory search. At length we
gave it up and slowly returned to the neighbourhood of the pier. By
this time the tide had turned, and a few loiterers were standing about
watching the procession of barges moving downstream on the ebb. Among
them was a grave-looking, sandy-haired man who leaned against the
watch-house, smoking reflectively as he surveyed the river. To this
philosopher Cobbledick addressed himself, explaining, as he was in
plain clothes:

“Good afternoon. I am a police officer and I am looking for a man who
is described on that bill.” Here he indicated the poster.

The philosopher turned a pale grey, and somewhat suspicious eye on
him, and having removed his pipe, expectorated thoughtfully but made
no comment on the statement.

“A sea-faring man,” continued the sergeant, “with a mole on the left
side of his nose.” He looked enquiringly at the philosopher, who
replied impassively:

“Nhm--nhm.”

“Do you happen to have seen a man answering that description?”

“Nhm--nhm,” was the slightly ambiguous reply.

“You _have_ seen him?” the sergeant asked, eagerly.

“Aye.”

“Do you know if he belongs to any of the craft that trade here?”

“Nhm--nhm.”

“Do you happen to know which particular vessel he belongs to?”

“Aye,” was the answer, accompanied by a grave nod.

“Can you tell me,” the sergeant asked patiently, “which vessel that
is, and where she is at present?”

Our friend replaced his pipe and took a long draw at it, gazing
meditatively at a schooner which was moving swiftly down the river
under the power of an auxiliary motor, and setting her sails as she
went. I had noticed her already, and observed that she had a white
under-body and black top-sides, and that she carried a single long
yard on her fore-mast. At length our friend removed his pipe,
expectorated, and nodded gravely at the schooner.

“Yon,” said he, and replaced his pipe, as a precaution, I supposed,
against unnecessary loquacity.

Cobbledick gazed wistfully at the receding schooner. “Pity,” said he.
“I should have liked to have a look at that fellow.”

“You could get the schooner held up at Sheerness, couldn’t you?” I
asked.

“Yes; I could send a ’phone message to Garrison Point Fort. But, you
see, she’s a foreigner. Might make trouble. And he is probably not the
man we want. After all, it’s only a matter of a mole.”

“Maulwurf,” murmured Bundy.

“Yes,” said the sergeant, with a faint grin; “those beggars were
laughing at us. Well, it can’t be helped.”

We stood for a moment or two watching the schooner set one sail after
another. Presently Bundy observed:

“Methinks, Sergeant, that Mr. Noah is trying to attract your
attention.”

We glanced towards the Ark, the tenant of which was seated in the
stern-sheets, scrubbing a length of rusty chain. As he caught the
sergeant’s eye, he beckoned mysteriously, whereupon we descended the
bank, and, picking our way across the muddy grass by his little
causeway of stepping-stones, approached the foot of the short ladder.

“Well, Israel,” said the sergeant, resting his hands on the gunwale of
the old boat as he made a rapid survey of the interior, “giving the
family plate a bit of a polish, eh?”

“Plate!” exclaimed the old man, holding up the chain, which, as I now
saw, had a number of double hooks linked to it, “this ain’t plate.
’Tis what we calls a creeper.”

“A creeper,” repeated the sergeant, looking at it with renewed
interest. “Ha, yes, hm. A creeper, hey? Well, Israel, what’s a-doing?
Have you got something to show us?”

The old man laid down the creeper and the scrubbing-brush--which had a
strong suggestion of salvage in its appearance--and moved towards the
door of the Ark. “Come along inside,” said he.

Cobbledick mounted the ladder and motioned me to follow, which I did,
while Bundy discretely sauntered away and sat down on the bank. On
entering, I observed that the Ark followed closely the constructional
traditions. Like its classical prototype, it was “pitched with pitch,
within and without,” and was furnished with a single small window, let
into the door and hermetically sealed.

Seeing that our host looked at me with some disfavour, the tactful
sergeant hastened to make us known to one another.

“This is Dr. Strangeways, Israel. He was Mrs. Frood’s doctor, and he
knows all about this affair. This, Doctor, is Mr. Israel Bangs, the
eminent long-shoreman, a sort of hereditary Grand Duke of the
Rochester foreshore.”

I bowed ceremoniously, and the Grand Duke acknowledged the
introduction with a sour grin. Then, lifting the greasy lid of a
locker, he dived into it and came to the surface, as it were, with a
small shoe in his hand.

“What do you say to that?” he demanded, holding the shoe under the
sergeant’s nose. The sergeant said nothing, but looked at me; and I,
suddenly conscious of the familiar sickening sensation, could do no
more than nod in reply. Soiled, muddy and sodden as it was, the poor
little relic instantly and vividly recalled the occasion when I had
last seen it, then all trim and smart, peeping coyly beneath the hem
of the neat brown skirt.

“Where did you find it, Israel?” asked Cobbledick.

“Ah,” said Bangs, with a sly leer, “that’s tellin’, that is. Never you
mind where I found it. There’s the shoe.”

“Don’t be a fool, Israel,” said the sergeant. “What use do you suppose
the shoe is to me if I don’t know where you found it? I’ve got to put
it in evidence, you know.”

“You can put it where you like, so long as you pays for it,” the old
rascal replied, doggedly. “The findin’ of it’s my business.”

There ensued a lengthy wrangle, but the sergeant, though patient and
polite, was firm. Eventually Israel gave way.

“Well,” he said, “if you undertakes not to let on to Sam Hooper or any
of his lot, I’ll tell you. I found it on the mud, side of the long
crik betwixt Blue Boar Head and Gas-’us Point.”

The sergeant made a note of the locality, and, after having sworn not
to divulge the secret to Sam Hooper or any other of the shore-rat
fraternity, and having ascertained that Israel had no further
information to dispose of, rose to depart; and, I noticed that, as we
passed out towards the ladder, he seemed to bestow a glance of
friendly recognition on the creeper.

“Well,” said Bundy, when we rejoined him, “what had Mr. Noah to say? I
hope you remembered me kindly to my old friends, Shem, Ham, and
Japhet.”

“He has found one of Mrs. Frood’s shoes,” answered the sergeant,
producing it from his pocket and offering it for inspection. Bundy
glanced at it indifferently, and then remarked: “It seems to answer
the description, but, for my part, I don’t quite see the use of all
this searching and prying. It only proves what we all know. There’s no
doubt that she fell into the river. The question is, how did she get
there? It is not likely that it was an accident, and, if it wasn’t, it
must have been a crime. What we want to know is, who is the criminal?”

Cobbledick pocketed the shoe with an impatient gesture.

“That’s the way they always talk,” said he. “They will always begin at
the wrong end. The question, ‘Who is the murderer?’ does not arise
until it is certain that there has been a murder; and it can’t be
certain that there has been a murder until it is certain that the
missing person is dead. And that certainty can hardly be established
until the body is found. But, in the meantime, these articles are
evidence enough to justify us in making other inquiries, and they may
give us a hint where to look for the body. They do, in fact. They
suggest that the body is probably not very far away, and more likely
to be up-stream than down.”

“I don’t see how they do,” said Bundy.

“I do,” retorted the sergeant, “and that’s enough for me.”

Bundy, with his customary discretion, took this as closing the
discussion, and further--as I guessed--surmising that the sergeant
might wish to have a few words with me alone, took his leave of us
when we reached the vicinity of the office.

“That is not a bad idea of old Israel’s,” said Cobbledick, when Bundy
had gone. “The creeper, I mean.”

“What about it?” I asked.

“You know what a creeper is used for, I suppose,” said he. “In the old
days, the revenue boats used to trail them along over the bottom in
shallow water where they suspected that the smugglers had sunk their
tubs. You see they couldn’t always get a chance to land the stuff.
Then they used to fill the spirits into a lot of little ankers or
tubs, lash them together into a sort of raft and sink the raft close
in-shore, on a dark night, in a marked place where their pals could go
some other night and fish them up. Well the revenue cutters knew most
of those places and used to go there and drift over them trailing
creepers. Of course, if there were any tubs there, the creepers hooked
on to the lashings and up they came.”

“But what do you suppose is Israel’s idea?” I asked.

“Why, as the body ought to have come up long before this, and it
hasn’t, he thinks it has been sunk. It might have been taken up the
river in a boat, and sunk in midstream with a weight of some sort. Or
it might have got caught by a lost anchor or on some old moorings.
That would account for its not coming up and for these oddments
getting detached and drifting ashore. So old Israel is going to get to
work with a creeper. I expect he spends his nights creeping over the
likely spots, and that is what makes him so deuced secret about the
place where he found that shoe. He reckons that the body is somewhere
thereabouts.”

I made no comment on this rather horrible communication. Of course, it
was necessary that the body should be searched for, since its
discovery was the indispensable condition of the search for the
murderer. But I did not want to hear more of the dreadful details than
was absolutely unavoidable.

When we reached the Guildhall, I halted and was about to take leave of
the sergeant when he said, somewhat hesitatingly:

“Do you remember, Doctor, when you met me last Saturday, you had a
gentleman with you?”

“I remember,” said I.

“Now, I wonder if you would think I was taking a liberty if I were to
ask what that gentleman’s name was. I had an idea that I knew his
face.”

“Of course it wouldn’t be a liberty,” I replied. “His name is
Thorndyke; Dr. John Thorndyke.”

“Ah!” exclaimed Cobbledick, “I thought I couldn’t be mistaken. It
isn’t the sort of face that one would forget. I once heard him give
evidence at the Old Bailey. Wonderful evidence it was, too. Since then
I’ve read reports of his investigations from time to time. He’s a
marvellous man. The way he has of raking up evidence from nowhere is
perfectly astonishing. Did you happen to talk to him about this case
at all?”

“Well, you see, Sergeant,” I answered, rather evasively, “he had come
down here for the week-end as my guest----”

“Exactly, exactly,” Cobbledick interrupted, unconsciously helping me
to avoid answering his question, “he came down for a rest and a
change, and wouldn’t want to be bothered with professional matters.
Still, you know, I think he would be interested in this case. It is
quite in his own line. It is a queer case; a very queer case in some
respects.”

“In what respects?” I asked.

It was Cobbledick’s turn to be evasive. He had apparently said more
than he had intended, and now drew in his horns perceptibly.

“Why,” he replied, “when you come to think of--of the--er--the
character of the lady, for instance. Why should anyone want to do her
any harm? And then there is the mystery as to how it happened, and the
place, and--in fact, there are a number of things that are difficult
to understand. But I mustn’t keep you standing here. If you should
happen to see Dr. Thorndyke again, it might be as well to tell him
about the case. It would be sure to interest him; and if he should, by
any chance, want to know anything that you are not in a position to
tell him, why, you know where I am to be found. I shouldn’t want to
make any secrets with him. And he might spot something that we haven’t
noticed.”

I promised to follow the sergeant’s advice, and, having bid him adieu,
turned back, and walked slowly homeward. As I went I reflected
profoundly on my conversation with Cobbledick; from which, as it
seemed to me, two conclusions emerged. First, there were elements in
this mystery that were unknown to me. I had supposed that the essence
of the mystery was the mere absence of data. But it now appeared from
the sergeant’s utterances, and still more from his evasions, that he
saw farther into the affair than I did; either because he had more
facts, or because, by reason of his greater experience, the facts
meant more to him than they did to me. The second conclusion was that
he was in some way in difficulties; that he was conscious of an
inability to interpret satisfactorily the facts that were known to
him. His evident eagerness to get into touch with Thorndyke made this
pretty clear; and the two conclusions together suggested a further
question. How much did Thorndyke know? Did he know all that the
sergeant knew? Did he perchance know more? From the scanty data with
which I had supplied him, might he possibly have drawn some
illuminating inferences that had carried his understanding of the case
beyond either mine or Cobbledick’s? It was quite possible. Thorndyke’s
great reputation rested upon his extraordinary power of inference and
constructive reasoning from apparently unilluminating facts. The facts
in this case seemed unilluminating enough. But they might not be so to
him. And again I recalled how both he and the sergeant seemed to look
to the finding of the body as probably furnishing the solution of the
mystery.




 CHAPTER XII.
 THE PRINTS OF A VANISHED HAND

Mr. Bundy’s opinion that no particular significance attached to the
finding of further relics of the missing woman was one that I was
myself disposed to adopt. The disappearance of poor Angelina was an
undeniable fact, and there seemed to be no doubt that her body had
fallen, or been cast, into the river. On these facts, the recovery of
further articles belonging to her, and presumably detached from the
body, shed no additional light. From the body itself, whenever it
should be surrendered by the river, one hoped that something fresh
might be learned. But all that anyone could say was that Angelina
Frood had disappeared, that her disappearance was almost certainly
connected with a crime, and that the agents of that crime and their
motives for committing it were alike an impenetrable mystery, a
mystery that the finding of further detached articles tended in no way
to solve.

I shall, therefore, pass somewhat lightly over the incidents of the
succeeding discoveries, notwithstanding the keen interest in them
displayed by Sergeant Cobbledick and even by Thorndyke. On Monday, the
25th of May, the second shoe was found (to Israel Bangs’ unspeakable
indignation) by Samuel Hooper of Foul Anchor Alley, who discovered it
shortly after high-water, lying on the gridiron close to Gas-house
Point, and brought it in triumph to the police station.

After this, there followed a long interval, occupied by a feverish
contest between Israel Bangs and Samuel Hooper. But the luck fell to
the experienced Israel. On Saturday, the 20th of June, that
investigator, having grounded his boat below a wharf between Gas-house
Point and the bridge, discovered a silver-headed hat-pin lying on the
shore between two of the piles of the wharf. Its identity was
unmistakable. The silver poppy-head that crowned the pin was no trade
production that might have had thousands of indistinguishable fellows.
It was an individual work wrought by an artist in metal, and excepting
its fellow, there was probably not another like it in the world.

The discovery of this object roused a positive frenzy of search. The
stretch of muddy shore between Gas-house Point and the bridge
literally swarmed with human shore-rats, male and female, adult and
juvenile. Every day, and all the day, excepting at high-water, Israel
Bangs hovered in his oozy little basket of a boat on the extreme edge
of the mud, scanning every inch of slime, and glowering fiercely at
the poachers ashore who were raking over his preserves. But nothing
came of it. Day after day passed. The black and odorous mud was
churned up by countless feet; the pebbles were sorted out severally by
innumerable filthy hands; every derelict pot, pan, box, or meat-tin
was picked up again and again, and explored to its inmost recesses.
But in vain. Not a single relic of any kind was brought to light by
all those searchings and grubbings in the mud. Presently the searchers
began to grow discouraged. Some of them gave up the search; others
migrated to the shore beyond the bridge, and were to be seen wading in
the mud below the Esplanade, the cricket-ground, or the boat-building
yards. So the month of June ran out, and the third month began. And
still there was no sign of the body.

Meanwhile I watched the two professional investigators, and noted a
certain similarity in their outlook and methods. Both were keenly
interested in the discoveries; and both, I observed, personally
examined the localities of the finds. The sergeant conducted me to
each spot in turn, making appropriate, but not very illuminating,
comments; and I perceived that he was keeping a careful account of
time and place. So, too, with Thorndyke, who had now taken to coming
down regularly each week-end. He visited each spot where anything had
been found, marking it carefully on his map, together with a reference
number, and inquiring minutely as to the character of the object, its
condition, and the state of the tide and the hour of the day when it
was discovered; all of which particulars he entered in his note-book
under the appropriate reference number.

Both of my friends, too, expressed increasing surprise and uneasiness
at the non-appearance of the body. The sergeant was really worried,
and he expressed his sentiments in a tone of complaint as if he felt
that he was not being fairly treated.

“It’s getting very serious, Doctor,” he protested. “Nearly three
months gone--three summer months, mind you--and not a sign of it. I
don’t like the look of things at all. This case means a lot to me.
It’s my chance. It’s a detective-inspector’s job, and if I bring it
off it’ll be a big feather in my cap. I want to get a conviction, and
so far I haven’t got the material for a coroner’s verdict. I’ve half a
mind to do a bit of creeping myself.”

Thorndyke’s observations on the case were much to the same effect.
Discussing it one Saturday afternoon at the beginning of July, when I
had met him at Strood Station and was walking with him into Rochester,
he said:

“My feeling is that the crux of this case is going to be the question
of identity--if the body ever comes to light. Of course, if it
doesn’t, there is no case: it is simply an unexplained disappearance.
But if the body is found and is unrecognizable excepting by clothing
and other extrinsic evidence, it will be hard to get a conviction even
if the unrecognizable corpse should give some clue to the
circumstances of death.”

“I suppose,” said I, “the police are searching for Nicholas Frood.”

“I doubt it,” he replied. “They are not likely to be wasting efforts
to find a murderer when there is no evidence that a murder has been
committed. What could they do if they did find him? The woman was not
in his custody or even living with him. And his previous conduct is
not relevant in the absence of evidence of his wife’s death.”

“You said you were making some inquiries yourself.”

“So I am. And I am not without hopes of picking up his tracks. But
that is a secondary matter. What we have to settle beyond the shadow
of a doubt is the question, ‘What has become of Angelina Frood? Is she
dead? And, if she is, what was the cause and what were the
circumstances of her death?’ The evidence in our possession points to
the conclusion that she is dead, and that she met her death by foul
means. That is the belief that the known facts produce. But we have
got to turn that belief into certainty. Then it will be time to
inquire as to the identity of the criminal.”

“Do you suppose the body would be unrecognizable now?”

“I feel no doubt that it would be quite unrecognizable by ordinary
means if it has been in the water all this time. But it would still be
identifiable in the scientific sense, if we could only obtain the
necessary data. It could, for instance, be tested by the Bertillon
measurements, if we had them; and it would probably yield
finger-prints, clear enough to recognize, long after the disappearance
of all facial character or bodily traits.”

“Would it really?” I exclaimed.

“Certainly,” he replied. “Even if the whole outer skin of the hand had
come off bodily, like a glove, as it commonly does in long-submerged
bodies, that glove-like cast would yield fairly clear finger-prints if
property treated--with dilute formalin, for instance. And then the
fingers from which the outer skin had become detached would still
yield recognizable finger-prints, if similarly treated; for you must
remember that the papillary ridges which form the finger-print
pattern, are in the true skin. The outer skin is merely moulded on
them. But, unfortunately, the question is one of merely academic
interest to us as we have no original finger-prints of Mrs. Frood’s by
which to test the body. The only method of scientific identification
that seems to be available is that of anthropometric measurements, as
employed by Bertillon.”

“But,” I objected, “the Bertillon system is based on the existence of
a record of the measurements of the person to be identified. We have
no record of the measurements of Mrs. Frood.”

“True,” he agreed. “But you may remember that Dr. George Bertillon was
accustomed to apply his system, not only to suspected persons who had
been arrested, but also to stray garments, hat, gloves, shoes, and so
forth, that came into the possession of the police. But it is clear
that, if such garments can be compared with a table of recorded
measurements, they can be used as standards of comparison to determine
the identity of a dead body. Of course, the measurements would have to
be taken, both of the garments and of the body, by someone having an
expert knowledge of anthropometrical methods.”

“Of course,” I agreed. “But it seems a sound method. I must mention it
to Cobbledick. He has the undoubted shoes, and I have no doubt that he
could get a supply of worn garments from Mrs. Gillow.”

“Yes,” said Thorndyke. “And, speaking of Mrs. Gillow reminds me of
another point that I have been intending to inquire into. You
mentioned to me that Mrs. Gillow told you, at the time of the
disappearance, that she had been expecting a tragedy of some kind. She
must have had some grounds for that expectation.”

“She said it was nothing but a vague, general impression.”

“Still, there must have been something that gave her that impression.
Don’t you think it would be well to question her a little more
closely?”

“Perhaps it might,” said I, not very enthusiastically. “We are close
to the house now. We can call in and see her, if you like.”

“I think we ought to leave no stone unturned,” said he; and a minute
or two later, when we arrived opposite the office, he remarked,
looking across attentively at the two houses: “I don’t see our friend
Bundy’s face at the window.”

“No,” I replied, “he is playing tennis somewhere up at the Vines. But
here is Mrs. Gillow, herself, all dressed up and evidently going out
visiting.”

The landlady had appeared at the door just as we were crossing the
road. Perceiving that we were bearing down on her, she paused, holding
the door ajar. I ran up the steps, and having wished her “good
afternoon” asked if she had time to answer one or two questions.

“Certainly,” she replied, “though I mustn’t stay long because I have
promised to go to tea with my sister at Frinsbury. I usually go there
on a Saturday. Perhaps we had better go into poor Mrs. Frood’s room.”

She opened the door of the sitting-room, and we all went in and sat
down.

“I have been talking over this mysterious affair, Mrs. Gillow,” said
I, “with my friend, Dr. Thorndyke, who is a lawyer, and he suggested
that you might be able to throw some light on it. You remember that
you had had some forebodings of some sort of trouble or disaster.”

“I had,” she replied, dismally, “but that was only because she always
seemed so worried and depressed, poor dear. And, of course, I knew
about that good-for-nothing husband of hers. That was all. Sergeant
Cobbledick asked me the same question, but I had nothing to tell him.”

“Did the sergeant examine the rooms?” asked Thorndyke.

“Yes, he looked over the place, and he opened her little davenport--it
isn’t locked--and read through one or two letters that he found there,
but he didn’t take them away. All he took with him was a few torn-up
letters that he found in the waste-paper basket.”

“If those other letters are still in the davenport,” said Thorndyke,
“I think it would be well for us to look through them carefully, if
you don’t mind, Mrs. Gillow.”

“I don’t see that there could be any harm in it,” she replied. “I’ve
never touched anything in her rooms, myself, since she went away. I
thought it better not to. I haven’t even washed up her tea-things.
There they are, just as she left them, poor lamb. But if you are going
to look through those letters, I will ask you to excuse me, or I shall
keep my sister waiting for tea.”

“Certainly, Mrs. Gillow,” said I. “Don’t let us detain you. And, by
the way,” I added, as I walked with her to the door, “it would be as
well not to say anything to anybody about my having come here with my
friend.”

“Very well, sir,” she replied. “I think you are right. The least said,
the soonest mended”; and with this profound generalization she went
out and I shut the street door after her.

When I returned to the sitting-room I found Thorndyke engaged in a
minute examination of the tea-things, and in particular of the spoon.
I proceeded at once to the davenport, and, finding it unlocked, lifted
the desk-lid and peered into the interior. It contained a supply of
papers and envelopes, neatly stacked, and one or two letters, which I
took out. They all appeared to be from the same person--the Miss
Cumbers, of whom I had heard, and a rapid glance at the contents
showed that they were of no use as a source of information. I passed
them to Thorndyke--who had laid down the spoon and was now looking
inquisitively about the room--who scanned them rapidly and returned
them to me.

“There is nothing in them,” said he. “Possibly the contents of the
waste-paper basket were more illuminating. But I suspect not, as the
sergeant appears to be as much in the dark as we are. Shall we have a
look at the bedroom before we go?”

I saw no particular reason for doing so, but, assuming that he knew
best, I made no objection. Going out into the hall, we entered the
deserted bed-room, the door of which was locked, though the key had
not been removed. At the threshold Thorndyke paused and stood for
nearly half a minute looking about the room in the same queer,
inquisitive way that I had noticed in the other room, as if he were
trying to fix a mental picture of it. Meanwhile, full of the Bertillon
system, I had walked across to the wardrobe to see what garments were
available for measurement. I had my hand on the knob of the door when
my glance fell on two objects on the dressing-table; an empty tumbler
and a small water-bottle, half-full. There was nothing very remarkable
about these objects, taken by themselves, but, even from where I
stood, I could see that both bore a number of finger-marks which stood
out conspicuously on the plain glass.

“By Jove!” I exclaimed. “Here is the very thing that you were speaking
of. Do you see what it is?”

Apparently he had, for he had already taken his gloves out of his
pocket and was putting them on.

“Don’t touch them, Strangeways,” said he, as I was approaching to
inspect them more closely. “If these are Mrs. Frood’s finger-prints
they may be invaluable. We mustn’t confuse them by adding our own.”

“Whose else could they be?” I asked.

“They might be Sergeant Cobbledick’s,” he replied. “The sergeant has
been in here.” He drew a chair up to the table, and, taking a lens
from his pocket, began systematically to examine the markings.

“They are a remarkably fine set,” he remarked, “and a complete
set--the whole ten digits. Whoever made them held the bottle in the
right hand and the tumbler in the left. And I don’t think they are the
sergeant’s. They are too small and too clear and delicate.”

“No,” I agreed, “and the probabilities are against their being his.
There is no reason why he should have wanted to take a drink of water
during the few minutes that he spent here. It would have been
different if it had been a beer bottle. But it would have been quite
natural for Mrs. Frood to drink a glass of water while she was
dressing or before she started out.”

“Yes,” said he. “Those are the obvious probabilities. But we must turn
them into certainties if we can. Probabilities are not good data to
work from. But the question is now, what are we to do? I have a small
camera with me, but it would not be very convenient to take the
photographs here, and it would occupy a good deal of time. On the
other hand, these things would be difficult to pack without smearing
the finger-prints. We want a couple of small boxes.”

“Perhaps,” said I, “we may find something that will do if we take a
look round.”

“Yes,” he agreed, “we must explore the place. Meanwhile, I think I
will develop up these prints for our immediate information, as we have
to try to find some others to verify them.”

He went back to the sitting-room, where he had put down the two cases
that he always brought with him: a small suit-case that contained his
toilet necessaries and a similar-sized case covered with green canvas
which had been rather a mystery to me. I had never seen it open, and
had occasionally speculated on the nature of its contents. My
curiosity was now to be satisfied, for, when he returned with it in
his hand he explained: “This is what I call my research-case. It
contains the materials and appliances for nearly every kind of
medico-legal investigation, and I hardly ever travel without it.”

He placed it on a chair and opened it, when I saw that it formed a
complete portable laboratory, containing, among other things a
diminutive microscope, a little folding camera, and an insufflator, or
powder-spray. The latter he now took from its compartment, and,
lifting the tumbler with his gloved hand, stood it on a corner of the
mantelpiece and blew over it with the insufflator a cloud of
impalpably fine white powder, which settled evenly on the surface of
the glass. He then tapped the tumbler gently once or twice with a lead
pencil, when most of the powder coating either jarred off or crept
down the surface. Finally, he blew at it lightly, which removed the
rest of the powder, leaving the finger-prints standing out on the
clear glass as if they had been painted on with Chinese white.

While he was operating in the same manner on the water-bottle--having
first emptied it into the ewer--I examined the tumbler with the aid of
his lens. The markings were amazingly clear and distinct. Through the
lens I could see, not only the whole of the curious, complicated
ridge-pattern, but even the rows of little round spots that marked the
orifices of the sweat glands. For the first time, I realized what a
perfect means of identification these remarkable imprints furnished.

“Now,” said Thorndyke, when he had finished with the bottle, “the two
questions are, where shall we look for confirmatory finger-prints, and
where are we to get the boxes that we want for packing these things?
You said that Mrs. Frood had a kitchen.”

“Yes. But won’t you try the furniture here; the wardrobe door, for
instance. The dark, polished mahogany ought to give good prints.”

“An excellent suggestion, Strangeways,” said he. “We might even find
the sergeant’s finger-prints, as he has probably had the wardrobe
open.”

He sprayed the three doors of the wardrobe, and when he had tapped
them and blown away the surplus powder, there appeared near the edge
of each a number of finger-marks, mostly rather indistinct, and none
of them nearly so clear as those on the glass.

“This is very satisfactory,” said Thorndyke. “They are poor prints,
but you can see quite plainly that there are two pairs of hands, one
pair much larger than the other; and the prints of the larger hands
are evidently not the same pattern as those on the glass, whereas
those of the smaller ones are quite recognizable as the same, in spite
of their indistinctness. As the large ones are almost certainly
Cobbledick’s, the small ones are pretty certainly Mrs. Frood’s. But we
mustn’t take anything for granted. Let us go down to the kitchen. We
shall have a better chance there.”

The door of the basement staircase was still unlocked, as Mrs. Gillow
had described it. I threw it open, and we descended together, I
carrying the insufflator and he bearing the tumbler and bottle in his
gloved hands. When he had put the two articles down on the kitchen
table, he proceeded to powder first the kitchen door and then the
side-door that gave on to the passage between the two houses. Both of
them were painted a dark green and both yielded obvious finger-marks,
and though these were mere oval smudges, devoid of any trace of
pattern, their size and their groupings showed clearly enough that
they appertained to a small hand. But we got more conclusive
confirmation from a small aluminium frying-pan that had been left on
the gas stove; for, on powdering the handle, Thorndyke brought into
view a remarkably clear thumb-print, which was obviously identical
with that on the water-bottle.

“I think,” said he, “that settles the question. If Mrs. Gillow has not
touched anything in these premises--as she assures us that she has
not--then we can safely assume that these are Mrs. Frood’s
finger-prints.”

“Are you going to annex the frying-pan to produce in evidence?” I
asked.

“No,” he replied. “This verification is for our own information: to
secure us against the chance of producing Cobbledick’s finger-prints
to identify the body. I propose, for the present, to say nothing to
anyone as to our possessing this knowledge. When the time comes we can
tell what we know. Until then we shall keep our own counsel.”

Once more I found myself dimly surprised at my friend’s apparently
unnecessary secrecy, but, assuming that he knew best, I made no
comment, but watched with somewhat puzzled curiosity his further
proceedings. His interest in the place was extraordinary. In a queer,
cat-like fashion he prowled about the premises, examining the most
trivial objects with almost ludicrous attention. He went carefully
through the cooking appliances and the glass and china; he peered into
cupboards, particularly into a large, deep cupboard in which spare
crockery was stored, and which was, oddly enough, provided with a Yale
lock; he sorted out the meagre contents of the refuse-bin, and
incidentally salved from it a couple of cardboard boxes that had
originally contained groceries, and he explored the, now somewhat
unsavoury, larder.

“I suppose,” he said reflectively, “the dustman must have used the
side door. Do you happen to know?”

“I don’t,” said I, inwardly wondering what the deuce the dustman had
to do with the case. “I understand that the door of the passage was
not used.”

“But she couldn’t have had the dust-bin carried up the stairs and out
at the front door,” he objected.

“I should think not,” said I. “Perhaps we could judge better if we had
a look at the passage.”

He adopted the suggestion and we opened the side-door--which had a
Yale night-latch--and went out into the covered passage that was
common to the two houses. The door that opened on to the street was
bolted on the inside, but the bolts were in good working order, as we
ascertained by drawing them gently; so this gave no evidence one way
or the other. Then Thorndyke carefully examined the hard gravel floor
of the passage, apparently searching for dropped fragments, or the
dustman’s foot-prints; but though there were traces suggesting that
the side-doors had been used, there were no perceptible tracks leading
to the street or in any way specifically suggestive of dustmen.

“Japp seems fond of Yale locks,” observed Thorndyke, indicating the
second side-door, which was also fitted with one. “I wonder where he
keeps his dust-bin.”

“Would it be worth while to ask him?” said I, more and more mystified
by this extraordinary investigation.

“No,” he replied, very definitely. “A question often gives more
information than it elicits.”

“It might easily do that in my case,” I remarked with a grin; upon
which he laughed softly and led the way back into the house. There I
gathered up the two boxes and the insufflator and made my way up to
the bed-room, he following with the tumbler and the water-bottle. Then
came the critical business of packing these two precious objects in
the boxes in such a way as to protect the finger-prints from contact
with the sides; which was accomplished very neatly with the aid of a
number of balls of plasticine from the inexhaustible research-case.

“This is a little disappointing,” said Thorndyke, looking at the
hair-brush and comb as he took off his gloves. “I had hoped to collect
a useful sample of hair. But her excessive tidiness defeats us. There
seems to be only one or two short hairs and one full length. However,
we may as well have them. They won’t be of much use for comparison
with the naked eye, but even a single hair can be used as a colour
control under the microscope.”

He combed the brush until the last hair was extracted from it, and
then drew the little collection from the comb and arranged it on a
sheet of paper. There were six short hairs, from two to four inches
long, and one long hair, which seemed to have been broken off, as it
had no bulb.

“Many ladies keep a combing-bag,” he remarked, as he bestowed the
collection in a seed-envelope from the research-case; “but I gather
from your description that Mrs. Frood’s hair was luxuriant enough to
render that economy unnecessary. At any rate, there doesn’t seem to be
such a bag. And now I think we have finished, and we haven’t done so
badly.”

“We have certainly got an excellent set of finger-prints,” said I.
“But it seems rather doubtful whether there will ever be an
opportunity of using them; and if there isn’t, we shan’t be much more
forward for our exploration. Of course, there is the hair.”

“Yes,” said Thorndyke, “there is the hair. That may be quite valuable.
And perhaps there are some other matters--but time will show.”

With this somewhat cryptic conclusion he proceeded with great care to
pack the two boxes in his suit-case, wedging them with his pyjamas so
that they should not get shaken in transit.

As we walked home I reflected on Thorndyke’s last remark. It seemed to
contain a suggestion that the mystery of Angelina’s death was not so
complete to him as it was to me. For my own part, I could see no
glimmer of light in any direction. She seemed to have vanished without
leaving a trace excepting those few derelict objects which had been
washed ashore and which told us nothing. But was it possible that
those objects bore some significance that I had overlooked? That they
were charged with some message that I had failed to decipher? I
recalled a certain reticence on the part of Cobbledick which had made
me suspect him of concealing from me some knowledge that he held or
some inferences that he had drawn; and now there was this cryptic
remark of Thorndyke’s, offering the same suggestion. Might it possibly
be that the profound obscurity was only in my own mind, the product of
my inexperience, and that to these skilled investigators the problem
presented a more intelligible aspect? It might easily be. I determined
cautiously to approach the question.

“You seemed,” said I, “to imply, just now, that there are certain data
for forming hypotheses as to the solution of this mystery that
envelops the disappearance of Mrs. Frood. But I am not aware of any
such data. Are you?”

“Your question, Strangeways,” he replied, “turns on the meaning of the
word ‘aware.’ If two men, one literate and the other illiterate, look
at a page of a printed book, both may be said to be aware of it; that
is to say that in both it produces a retinal image which makes them
conscious of it as a visible object having certain optical properties.
In the case of the illiterate man the perception of the optical
properties is the total effect. But the literate man has something in
his consciousness already, and this something combines, as it were,
with the optical perception, and makes him aware of certain secondary
properties of the printed characters. To both, the page yields a
visual impression; but to one only does it yield what we may call a
psychical impression. Are they both aware of the page?”

“I appreciate your point,” said I, with a sour smile, “and I seem to
be aware of a rather skilful evasion of my question.”

He smiled in his turn and rejoined: “Your question was a little
indirect. Shall we have it in a more direct form?”

“What I wanted to know,” said I, “though I suppose I have no right to
ask, is whether there appears to you to be any prospect whatever of
finding any solution of the mystery of Mrs. Frood’s death.”

“The answer to that question,” he replied, “is furnished by my own
proceedings. I am not a communicative man, as you may have noticed,
but I will say this much: that I have taken, and am taking, a good
deal of trouble with this case, and am prepared to take more, and that
I do not usually waste my efforts on problems that appear to be
unsolvable. I am not disposed to say more than that, excepting to
refer you again to the instance of the printed page and to remind you
that whatever I know I have either learned from you or from the
observation, in your company, of objects equally visible to both of
us.”

This reply, if not very illuminating, at least answered my question,
as it conveyed to me that I was not likely to get much more
information out of my secretive friend. Nevertheless, I asked:

“About the man Frood: you were saying that you had some hopes of
running him to earth.”

“Yes, I have made a start. I have ascertained that he did apparently
set out for Brighton the day before Mrs. Frood’s disappearance, but he
never arrived there. That is all I know at present. He was seen
getting into the Brighton train, but he did not appear at the Brighton
barrier--my informant had the curiosity to watch all the passengers go
through--and he never made the visit which was the ostensible object
of his journey. So he must have got out at an intermediate station. It
may be difficult to trace him, but I am not without hope of succeeding
eventually. Obviously, his whereabouts on the fatal day is a matter
that has to be settled. At present he is the obvious suspect; but if
an alibi should be proved in his case, a search would have to be
initiated in some other direction.”

This conversation brought us to my house in time to relieve Mrs.
Dunk’s anxieties on the subject of dinner; and as the daylight was
already gone, the photographic operations were postponed until the
following morning. Indeed, Thorndyke had thought of taking the objects
to his chambers, where a more efficient outfit was available, but, on
reflection, he decided to take the photographs in my presence so that
I could, if necessary, attest their genuineness on oath. Accordingly,
on the following morning, we very carefully extracted the tumbler and
the bottle from their respective boxes and set them up, with a black
coat of mine for a background, at the end of a table. Then Thorndyke
produced his small folding camera--which pulled out to a surprising
length--and, having fitted it with a short-focus objective, made the
exposures, and developed the plates in a dark cupboard by the light of
a little red lamp from the research case. When the plates were dry we
inspected them through a lens, and found them microscopically sharp.
Finally, at Thorndyke’s suggestion, I scratched my initials with a
needle in the corner of each plate.

“Well,” I said, when he had finished, “you have got the evidence that
you wanted, and in a very complete form. It remains to be seen now
whether you will ever get an opportunity to use it.”

“Don’t be pessimistic, Strangeways,” said he. “We have had exceptional
luck in getting this splendid series of finger-prints. Let us hope
that Fortune will not desert us after making us these gifts.”

“What is to be done with the originals?” I asked. “Shall I put them
back where we found them?”

“I think not,” he replied. “If you have a safe or a secure lock-up
cupboard, where they could be put away, out of sight, and from whence
they could be produced if necessary, I will ask you to take charge of
them.”

There was a cupboard with a good lock in the old bureau that I had
found in my bedroom, and to this I conveyed the precious objects and
locked them in. And so ended--at least, for the present--the episode
of our raid on poor Angelina’s abode.




 CHAPTER XIII.
 THE DISCOVERY IN BLACK BOY-LANE

On a fine, sunny afternoon, about ten days after our raid on
Angelina’s rooms (it was Tuesday, the 14th of July, to be exact), I
was sitting in my dining-room, from which the traces of lunch had just
been removed, idly glancing over the paper, and considering the
advisability of taking a walk, when I heard the door-bell ring. There
was a short interval; then the door was opened, and the sounds of
strife and wrangling that followed this phenomenon informed me that
the visitor was Mr. Bundy, between whom and Mrs. Dunk there existed a
state of chronic warfare. Presently the dining-room door opened--in
time for me to catch a concluding growl of defiance from Mrs.
Dunk--and that lady announced gruffly: “Mr. Bundy.”

My visitor tripped in smilingly, “all teeth and eyeglass,” as his
inveterate enemy had once expressed it, holding a Panama hat, which
had temporarily superseded the velour.

“Well, John,” said he, “coming out to play?” He had lately taken to
calling me John; in fact, a very close and pleasant intimacy had
sprung up between us. It dated from the occasion when I had confided
to him my unfortunate passion for poor Angelina. That confidence he
had evidently taken as a great compliment, and the matter of it had
struck a sympathetic chord in his kindly nature. From that moment
there had been a sensible change in his manner towards me. Beneath his
habitual flippancy there was an undertone of gentleness and sympathy,
and even of affection. Nor had I been unresponsive. Like Thorndyke, I
found in his sunny temperament, his invariable cheerfulness and high
spirits, a communicable quality that took effect on my own state of
mind. And then I had early recognized that, in spite of his apparent
giddiness, Bundy was a man of excellent intelligence and considerable
strength of character. So the friendship had ripened naturally enough.

I rose from my chair and, dropping the paper, stretched myself.

“You are an idle young dog,” said I. “Why aren’t you at work?”

“Nothing doing at the office except some specifications. Japp is doing
them. Come out and have a roll round.”

“Well, Jimmy,” said I. “Your name is Jimmy, isn’t it?”

“No, it is not,” he replied with dignity. “I am called Peter--like the
Bishop of Rumtifoo, and, by a curious coincidence, for the very same
reason.”

“Let me see,” said I, falling instantly into the trap, “what was that
reason?”

“Why, you see,” he replied impressively, “the Bishop was called Peter
because that was his name.”

“Look here, young fellow my lad,” said I, “you’ll get yourself into
trouble if you come up here pulling your elder’s legs.”

“It was only a gentle tweak, old chap,” said he. “Besides, you aren’t
so blooming senile, after all. You are only cutting your first crop of
whiskers. Are you coming out? I saw old Cobbledick just now, turning
down Blue Boar Lane and looking as miserable as a wet cat.”

“What was he looking miserable about?”

“The slump in relics, I expect. He is making no headway with his
investigation. I fancy he had reckoned on getting an inspectorship out
of this case, whereas, if he doesn’t reach some sort of conclusion, he
is likely to get his rapples knucked, as old Miss Barman would say. I
suspect he was on his way to the Ark to confer with Mr. Noah. What do
you say to a stroll in the direction of Mount Ararat?”

It was a cunning suggestion on the part of Bundy, for it drew me
instantly. Repulsive as old Israel’s activities were to me, the
presence of those finger-prints, securely locked up in my bureau, had
created in me a fresh anxiety to see the first state of the
investigation completed so that the search for the murderer could be
commenced in earnest. Not that my presence would help the sergeant,
but that I was eager to hear the tidings of any new discovery.

Bundy’s inference had been quite correct. We arrived at the head of
the Blue Boar pier just in time to see the sergeant slowly descending
the ladder, watched gloomily by Israel Bangs. As the former reached
terra firma he turned round and then observed us.

“Any news, Sergeant?” I asked, as he approached across the grass.

He shook his head discontentedly. “No,” he replied, “not a sign; not a
vestige. It’s a most mysterious affair. The things seemed to be coming
up quite regularly until that hatpin was found. Then everything came
to an end. Not a trace of anything for nigh upon a month. And what, in
the name of Fortune, can have become of the body? That’s what I can’t
make out. If this goes on much longer, there won’t be any body: and
then we shall be done. The case will have to be dropped.”

He took off his hat (he was in plain clothes as usual) and wiped his
forehead, looking blankly first at me and then at Bundy. The latter
also took off his hat and whisked out his handkerchief, bringing with
it a little telescope which fell to the ground and was immediately
picked up by the sergeant. “Neat little glass, this,” he remarked,
dusting it with his handkerchief. “It’s lucky it fell on the turf.” He
took off the cap, and pulling out the tubes, peered vaguely through it
up and down the river. Presently he handed it to me. “Look at those
craft down below the dockyard,” said he.

I took the little instrument from him and pointed it at the group of
small, cutter-rigged vessels that he had indicated, of which the
telescope, small as it was, gave a brilliantly sharp picture.

“What are they?” I asked. “Oyster dredgers?”

“No,” he replied. “They are bawleys with their shrimp-trawls down. But
there are plenty of oyster-dredgers in the lower river and out in the
estuary, and what beats me is why none of them ever brings up anything
in the trawls or dredges--anything in our line, I mean.”

“What did you expect them to bring up?” Bundy asked.

“Well, there are the things that have washed ashore, and there are the
other things that haven’t washed ashore yet. And then there is the
body.”

“Mr. Noah would have something to say if they brought that up,” said
Bundy. “By the way, what had he got to say when you called on him?”

“Old Bangs? Why he is getting a bit shirty. Wants me to pay him for
all the time he has lost on creeping and searching. Of course, I can’t
do that, I didn’t employ him.”

“Did he find the hat-pin that you spoke of?” Bundy asked.

“Yes; and he has been grubbing round the place where he found it ever
since, as if he thought hat-pins grew there.”

“Still,” said Bundy, “it is not so unreasonable. A hat-pin couldn’t
have floated ashore. If the hat came off, the two hat-pins must have
fallen out at pretty much the same time and place.”

“Yes,” the sergeant agreed, reflectively, “that seems to be common
sense; and, if it is, the other hat-pin ought to be lying somewhere
close by. I must go and have a look there myself.” He again reflected
for a few moments and then asked: “Would you like to see the place
where Israel found the pin?”

As I had seen the place already and had shown it to Thorndyke, I left
Bundy to answer.

“Why not?” he assented, rather, I suspected, to humour the sergeant
than because he felt any particular interest in the place. Thereupon
Cobbledick, whose enthusiasm appeared to have been revived by Bundy’s
remark, led the way briskly towards the wilderness by the
coal-wharves, through that desolate region and along a cart-track that
skirted the marshes until we came out into a sort of lesser wilderness
to the west of Gas-House Road. Here the sergeant slipped through a
large hole in a corrugated iron fence which gave access to a wharf
littered with the unpresentable debris resulting from the activities
of a firm of ship-knackers. Advancing to the edge of the wharf,
Cobbledick stood for a while looking down wistfully at the expanse of
unspeakable mud that the receding tide had uncovered.

“I suppose it is too dirty to go down,” he said in a regretful tone.

Bundy’s assent to this proposition was most emphatic and unqualified,
and the sergeant had to content himself with a bird’s-eye view. But he
made a very thorough inspection, walking along the edge of the wharf,
scrutinizing its base, pile by pile, and giving separate attention to
each pot, tin, or scrap of driftwood on the slimy surface. He even
borrowed Bundy’s telescope to enable him to examine the more distant
parts of the mud, until the owner of the instrument was reduced to the
necessity of standing behind him, for politeness’ sake, to get a
comfortable yawn.

“Well,” said Cobbledick, at long last, handing back the telescope, “I
suppose we must give it up. But it’s disappointing.”

“I don’t quite see why,” said Bundy. “You have found enough to prove
that the body is in the river, and no number of further relics would
prove any more.”

“No, there’s some truth in that,” Cobbledick agreed. “But I don’t like
the way that everything seems to have come to a stop.” He crawled
dejectedly through the hole in the fence and walked on for a minute or
two without speaking. Presently he halted and looked about him. “I
suppose Black Boy-lane will be our best way,” he remarked.

“Which is Black Boy-lane?” I asked.

“It is the lane we came down after we left Japp and Willard that day,”
Bundy explained.

“I remember,” said I, “but I didn’t know it had a name.”

“It was named after a little inn that used to stand somewhere near the
top; but it was pulled down years ago. Here’s the lane.”

We entered the little, tortuous alley that wound between the high,
tarred fences, and as it was too narrow for us to walk abreast, Bundy
dropped behind. A little way up the lane I noticed an old hat lying on
the high grass at the foot of the fence. Bundy apparently noticed it,
too, for just after we had passed it I heard the sound of a kick, and
the hat flew over my shoulder. At the same moment, and impelled by the
same kick, a small object, which I at first thought to be a pebble,
hopped swiftly along the ground in front of us, then rolled a little
way, and finally came to rest, when I saw that it was a button. I
should probably have passed it without further notice, having no use
for stray buttons. But the more thrifty sergeant stooped and picked it
up; and the instant that he looked at it he stopped dead.

“My God! Doctor,” he exclaimed, holding it out towards me. “Look at
this!”

I took it from him, though I had recognized it at a glance. It was a
small bronze button with a Tudor Rose embossed on it.

“This is a most amazing thing,” said Cobbledick. “There can’t be any
doubt as to what it is.”

“Not the slightest,” I agreed. “It is certainly one of the buttons
from Mrs. Frood’s coat. The question is, how on earth did it get
here?”

“Yes,” said the sergeant, “that is the question; and a very difficult
question, too.”

“Aren’t you taking rather a lot for granted?” suggested Bundy, to whom
I had passed the little object for inspection. “It doesn’t do to jump
at conclusions too much. Mrs. Frood isn’t likely to have had her
buttons made to order. She must have bought them somewhere. She might
even have bought them in Rochester. In any case, there must be
thousands of others like them.”

“I suppose there must be,” I admitted, “though I have never seen any
buttons like them.”

“Neither have I,” said Cobbledick, “and I am going to stick to the
obvious probabilities. The missing woman wore buttons like this, and I
shall assume that this is one of her buttons unless someone can prove
that it isn’t.”

“But how do you account for one of her buttons being here?” Bundy
objected.

“I don’t account for it,” retorted Cobbledick. “It’s a regular puzzle.
Of course, someone--a child, for instance--might have picked it up on
the shore and dropped it here. But that is a mere guess, and not a
very likely one. The obvious thing to do is to search this lane
thoroughly and see if there are any other traces; and that is what I
am going to do now. But don’t let me detain you two gentlemen if you
had rather not stay.”

“I shall certainly stay and help you, Sergeant,” said I; and Bundy,
assuming the virtue of enthusiasm, if he had it not, elected also to
stay and join in the search.

“We had better go back to the bottom of the lane,” said Cobbledick,
“and go through the grass at the foot of the fence from end to end. I
will take the right hand side and you take the left.”

We retraced our steps to the bottom of the lane and began a systematic
search, turning over the grass and weeds and exposing the earth inch
by inch. It was a slow process and would have appeared a singular
proceeding had any wayfarer passed through and observed us, but
fortunately it was an unfrequented place, and no one came to spy upon
us. We had traversed nearly half the lane when Bundy stood up and
stretched himself. “I don’t know what your back is made of, John,”
said he. “Mine feels as if it was made of broken bottles. How much
more have we got to do?”

“We haven’t done half yet,” I replied, also standing up and rubbing my
lumbar region; and at this moment the sergeant, who was a few yards
ahead, hailed us with a triumphant shout. We both turned quickly and
beheld him standing with one arm raised aloft and the hand grasping a
silver-topped hat-pin.

“What do you say to that, Mr. Bundy?” he demanded as we hurried
forward to examine the new “find.” “Shall we be jumping at conclusions
if we say that this hat-pin is Mrs. Frood’s?”

“No,” Bundy admitted after a glance at the silver poppy-head. “This
seems quite distinctive, and, of course, it confirms the button. But I
don’t understand it in the least. How can they have come here?”

“We won’t go into that,” said the sergeant, in a tone of suppressed
excitement that showed me pretty clearly that he had already gone into
it. “They are here. And now the question arises, what became of the
hat? It couldn’t have dropped off down at the wharf, or this hat-pin
wouldn’t be here; but it must have fallen off when both hat-pins were
gone. Now what can have become of it?”

“It might have been picked up and taken possession of by some woman,”
I suggested. “It was a good hat, and if the body was brought here soon
after the crime, as it must have been, it wouldn’t have been much
damaged. But why trouble about the hat? Appearances suggest that the
body was either brought up or taken down this lane. That is the new
and astonishing fact that needs explaining.”

“We don’t want to do any explaining now,” said Cobbledick. “We are
here to collect facts. If we can find out what became of the hat, that
may help us when we come to consider the explanations.”

“Well, it obviously isn’t here,” said I.

“No,” he agreed, “and it wouldn’t have been left here. A murderer
mightn’t have noticed the button, or even the hat-pin, on a dark,
foggy night. But he’d have noticed the hat; and he wouldn’t have left
it where it must have been seen, and probably led to inquiries. He
might have taken it with him, or he might have got rid of it. I should
say he would have got rid of it. What is on the other side of these
fences?”

We all hitched ourselves up the respective fences far enough to look
over. On the one side was a space of bare, gravelly ground with thin
patches of grass and numerous heaps of cinder; on the other was an
area of old waste land thickly covered with thistles, ragwort, and
other weeds. The sergeant elected to begin with the latter, as the
less frequented and therefore more probably undisturbed. Setting his
foot on the buttress of a post, he went over the fence with surprising
agility, considering his figure, and was lost to view; but we could
hear him raking about among the herbage close to the fence, and from
time to time I stood on the buttress and was able to witness his
proceedings. First he went to the bottom of the lane and from that
point returned by the fence, searching eagerly among the high weeds. I
saw him thus proceed, apparently to the top of the lane in the
neighbourhood of the remains of the city wall. Thence he came back,
but now at a greater distance from the fence, and as he was still
eagerly peering and probing amongst the weeds, it was evident that he
had had no success. Suddenly, when he was but a few yards away, he
uttered an exclamation and ran forward. Then I saw him stoop, and the
next moment he fairly ran towards me holding the unmistakable brown
straw hat with the dull green ribbon.

“That tells us what we wanted to know,” he said breathlessly, handing
the hat to me as he climbed over the fence; “at least, I think it
does. I’ll tell you what I mean--but not now,” he added in a lower
tone, though not unheard by Bundy, as I inferred later.

“I suppose we need hardly go on with the search any further?” I
suggested, having had enough of groping amongst the grass.

“Well, no,” he replied. “I shall go over it again later on, but we’ve
got enough to think about for the present. By the way, Mr. Bundy, I’ve
found something belonging to you. Isn’t this your property?”

He produced from his pocket a largish key, to which was attached a
wooden label legibly inscribed “Japp and Bundy, High-street,
Rochester.”

“By Jove!” exclaimed Bundy, “it is Japp’s precious key! Where on earth
did you find it, Sergeant?”

“Right up at the top,” was the reply. “Close to the old wall.”

“Now, I wonder how the deuce it got there,” said Bundy. “Some fool
must have thrown it over the fence from pure mischief. However, here
it is. You know there was a reward of ten shillings for finding it,
Sergeant. I had better settle up at once. You needn’t make any
difficulties about it,” he added, as the sergeant seemed disposed to
decline the payment. “It won’t come out of my pocket. It is the firm’s
business.”

On this understanding Cobbledick pocketed the proffered note and we
walked on up the lane, the sergeant slightly embarrassed, as we
approached the town, by the palpably unconcealable hat. Very little
was said by any of us, for these new discoveries, with the amazing
inferences that they suggested, gave us all abundant material for
thought. The sergeant walked with eyes bent on the ground, evidently
cogitating profoundly; my mind surged with new speculations and
hypotheses, while Bundy, if not similarly preoccupied, refrained from
breaking in on our meditations.

When, at length, by devious ways, we reached the High-street in the
neighbourhood of the Corn Exchange, we halted, and the sergeant looked
at me as if framing a question. Bundy glanced up at the quaint old
clock, and remarked:

“It is about time I got back to the office. Mustn’t leave poor old
Japp to do all the work, though he never grumbles. So I will leave you
here.”

I realized that this was only a polite excuse to enable the sergeant
to have a few words with me alone, and I accepted it as such.

“Good-bye, then,” said I, “if you must be off, and in case I don’t see
you before, I shall expect you to dinner on Saturday if you’ve got the
evening free. Dr. Thorndyke is coming down for the week-end, and I
know you enjoy ragging him.”

“He is pretty difficult to get a rise out of, all the same,” said
Bundy, brightening up perceptibly at the invitation. “But I shall turn
up with very great pleasure.” He bestowed a mock ceremonious salute on
me and the sergeant, and, turning away, bustled off in the direction
of the office. As soon as he was out of earshot Cobbledick opened the
subject of the new discoveries.

“This is an extraordinary development of our case, Doctor,” said he.
“I didn’t want to discuss it before Mr. Bundy, though he is really
quite a discreet gentleman, and pretty much on the spot, too. But he
isn’t a party to the case, and it is better not to talk too freely.
You see the points that these fresh finds raise?”

“I see that they put a new complexion on the affair, but to me they
only make the mystery deeper and more incomprehensible.”

“In a way they do,” Cobbledick agreed, “but, on the other hand, they
put the case on a more satisfactory footing. For instance, we
understand now why the body has never come to light. It was never in
the river at all. Then as to the perpetrator; he was a local man--or,
at least, there was a local man in it; a man who knew the town and the
waterside neighbourhood thoroughly. No stranger would have found Black
Boy-lane. Very few Rochester people know it.”

“But,” I asked, “what does the finding of these things suggest to
you?”

“Well,” he replied, “it suggests several questions. Let me just put
these things away in my office, and then we can talk the matter over.”
He went into his office, and shortly returned relieved--very much
relieved--of the conspicuous hat. We turned towards the bridge, and he
resumed: “The first question and the most important one is, which way
was the body travelling? It is obvious that it was carried through
Black Boy-lane. But in which direction? Towards the town or towards
the river? When you think of the circumstances; when you recall that
it was a foggy night when she disappeared; it seems at first more
probable that the crime might have been committed in, or near, the
lane, and the body carried down to the river. But when you consider
all the facts, that doesn’t seem possible. There is that box of
tablets, picked up dry and clean on Chatham Hard. That seems to fix
the locality where the crime occurred.”

“And there is the brooch,” said I.

“I don’t attach much importance to that,” he replied. “It might have
been picked up anywhere. But the box of tablets couldn’t have got from
Black Boy-lane to Chatham except by the river, and it hadn’t been in
the river. But the hat seems to me to settle the question. You see,
one hat-pin was found on the shore and the other in the lane near the
hat. Now, one hat-pin might have dropped out and left the hat still
fixed on the head. But when the hat came off, the pins must have come
off with it. The hat came off near the top of the lane. If both the
pins had been in it they would both have come out there. But one pin
was found on the shore; therefore when the body was at the shore the
hat must have been still on the head, though it had probably got
loosened by all the dragging about in the boat and in landing the
body. You agree to that, Doctor?”

“Yes, it seems undeniable,” I answered.

“Very well,” said he. “Then the body was being carried up the lane.
The next question is: was it being carried by one person or by more
than one? Well, I think you will agree with me, Doctor, that it could
hardly have been done by one man. It is quite a considerable distance
from the shore to the top of the lane. She was a good-sized woman, and
a dead body is a mighty awkward thing to carry at the best of times. I
should say there must have been at least two men.”

“It certainly does seem probable,” I admitted.

“I think so,” said he. “Then we come to another question. Was it
really a dead body? Or might the woman have been merely insensible?”

“Good God, Sergeant!” I exclaimed. “You don’t think it possible that
it could have been a case of forcible abduction, and that Mrs. Frood
is still alive?”

“I wouldn’t say it was impossible,” he replied, “but I certainly don’t
think it is the case. You see, nearly three months have passed and
there is no sign of her. But in modern England you can’t hide a
full-grown, able-bodied woman who has got all her wits about her. No,
Doctor, I am afraid we must take the view that the woman who was
carried up Black Boy-lane was a dead woman. All I want to point out is
that the other view is a bare possibility, and that we mustn’t forget
it.”

“But,” I urged, “don’t you think that the fact that she was being
carried towards the town strongly suggests that she was alive? Why on
earth should a murderer bring a body, at great risk of discovery, from
the river, where it could easily have been disposed of, up into the
town? It seems incredible.”

“It does,” he agreed. “It’s a regular facer. But, on the other hand,
suppose she was alive. What could they have done with her? How could
they have kept her out of sight all this time? And why should they
have done it?”

“As to the motive,” said I, “that is incomprehensible in any case. But
what do you suppose actually happened?”

“My theory of it is,” he replied, “that two men, at least, did the
job. Both may have been local waterside men, or there may have been a
stranger with a water-rat in his pay. I imagine the crime was
committed at Chatham, somewhere near the Sun Pier, and that the body
was put in a boat and brought up here. It was a densely foggy night,
you remember, so there would have been no great difficulty; and there
wouldn’t be many people about. The part of it that beats me is what
they meant to do with the body. They seem to have brought it
deliberately from Chatham right up into Rochester Town; and they have
got rid of it somehow. They must have had some place ready to stow it
in, but what that place can have been I can’t form the ghost of a
guess. It’s a fair knock-out.”

“You don’t suppose old Israel Bangs knows anything about it?” I
suggested.

The sergeant shook his head. “I’ve no reason to suppose he does,” he
replied. “And it is a bad plan to make guesses and name names.”

We walked up and down the Esplanade for nearly an hour, discussing
various possibilities; but we could make nothing of the incredible
thing that seemed to have happened in spite of its incredibility. At
last we gave it up and returned to the Guildhall, where, as we parted,
he said a little hesitatingly: “I heard you tell Mr. Bundy that Dr.
Thorndyke was coming down for the week-end. It wouldn’t be amiss if
you were to put the facts of the case before him. It’s quite in his
line, and I think he would be interested to hear about it; and he
might see something that I have missed. But, of course, it must be in
strict confidence.”

I promised to try to find an opportunity to get Thorndyke’s opinion on
the case, and with this we separated, the sergeant retiring to his
office and I making my way homeward to prepare a report for dispatch
by the last post.




 CHAPTER XIV.
 SERGEANT COBBLEDICK IS ENLIGHTENED

The custom which had grown upon my part of meeting Thorndyke at the
station on the occasion of his visits was duly honoured on the present
occasion, for the surprising discoveries in Black Boy-lane, which I
had described in my report to him, made me eager to hear his comments.
Unfortunately, on this occasion, he had come down by an unusually late
train, and the opportunity for discussion was limited to the time
occupied by the short walk from Rochester Station to my house. For it
was close upon dinner time, and I rather expected to find Bundy
awaiting us.

“Your report was quite a thrilling document,” he remarked, as we came
out of the station approach. “These new discoveries seem to launch us
on a fresh phase of the investigation.”

“Do they seem to you to offer any intelligible suggestions?” I asked.

“There is no lack of suggestions,” he replied. “To a person of
ordinary powers of imagination, a number of hypotheses must present
themselves. But, of course, the first thing to consider is not what
might have happened, but what did happen, and what we can safely infer
from those happenings. We can apparently take it as proved that the
body was carried through the lane; and everything goes to show that it
was carried from the river towards the town. The first clear inference
is that we can completely exclude accident, pure and simple. The
body--living or dead--may be assumed to have been carried by some
person or persons. We can dismiss the idea that the woman walked up
the lane. But if someone carried the body, someone is definitely
implicated. The affair comes unquestionably into the category of
crime.”

“That doesn’t carry us very far,” I said, with a sense of
disappointment.

“It carries us a stage farther than our previous data did, for it
excludes accident, which they did not. Then it suggests not only
premeditation, but arrangement. If the body was brought up from the
river, there must have been some place known to, and probably prepared
by, those who brought it, in which it could be deposited; and that
place must have been more secure than the river from which it was
brought. But the river, itself, was a very secure hiding-place,
especially if the body had been sunk with weights. Now, this is all
very remarkable. If you consider the extraordinary procedure; the
seizure of the victim at Chatham; the conveyance of the body from
thence to this considerable distance; the landing of it at the wharf;
the conveyance of it by an apparently selected route--at enormous risk
of discovery, in spite of the fog--to an appointed destination: I say,
Strangeways, that if you consider this astounding procedure, you
cannot fail to be convinced that there was some definite purpose
behind it.”

“Yes,” I agreed, “that seems to be so. But what could the purpose be?
It appears perfectly incomprehensible. It only makes the mystery more
unsolvable than ever.”

“Not at all,” he rejoined. “There is nothing so hopeless to
investigate as the perfectly obvious and common-place. As soon as an
apparently incomprehensible motive appears, we are within sight of a
solution. There may be innumerable explanations of a common-place
action; but an outrageously unreasonable action; pursued with definite
and considered purpose, can admit of but one or two. The action, with
its underlying purpose, must be adjusted to some unusual conditions.
We have only to consider to what conditions it could be adjusted, and
which, if any, of those conditions actually exist, and the explanation
of the apparently incomprehensible action comes into view. But here we
are at our destination, and there is our friend, Bundy, standing on
the doorstep. By the way, I have brought one or two photographs of
Mrs. Frood for you to look at.”

We arrived in time to intervene and put an end to a preliminary
skirmish between the irrepressible Bundy and Mrs. Dunk, and when
greetings had been exchanged, Thorndyke went up to his room to wash
and deposit his luggage.

“Well, John,” said Bundy, when he had hung up his hat, “it is very
pleasant to see my old friend after this long separation. Very good of
him, too, to invite an insignificant outsider like me to meet his
distinguished colleague. You are a benefactor to me, John.”

“Don’t talk nonsense, Peterkin,” said I. “You know we are always glad
to see you. I invite you for my own pleasure and Thorndyke’s, not for
yours.”

Bundy gave my arm a grateful squeeze. “Good old John,” said he.
“Nothing like doing it handsomely. But here is the great man himself,”
he added, as Thorndyke entered the dining-room, carrying a cardboard
box, “with instruments of magic. He’s going to do a conjuring trick.”

Thorndyke opened the box and delicately picked out four photographs,
all mounted and all of cabinet size, which he stood up in a row on the
mantelpiece. Two of them were from the same negative, one being
printed in red carbon, the other in sepia. The remaining two were
ordinary silver prints of the conventional trade type.

Bundy looked at the collection with not unnatural surprise.

“Where did these things come from?” he asked.

“They came from London,” replied Thorndyke, “where things of this kind
grow. Strangeways asked me to get him some samples. How do you like
them? My own preference is for the carbons, and of the two I think I
like the red chalk print the better.”

I ran my eye along the row and found myself in strong agreement with
Thorndyke. It was not only that the carbon prints had the advantage of
the finer medium. The treatment was altogether more artistic, and the
likeness seemed better, in spite of a rather over-strong top-lighting.

“Yes,” I said, “the carbons are infinitely superior to the silver
prints, and of the two I think the red is the better because it
emphasises the shadows less.”

“Is the likeness as good as in the silver prints?” Thorndyke asked.

“Better, I think. The expression is more natural and spontaneous. What
do you say, Peter?”

As I spoke I looked at him, not for the first time, for I had already
been struck by the intense concentration with which he had been
examining the two carbons. And it was not only concentration. There
was a curious expression of surprise, as if something in the
appearance of the portraits puzzled him.

He looked up with a perplexed frown. “As to the likeness,” said he, “I
don’t know that I am a particularly good judge. I only saw her once or
twice. But, as far as I remember, it seems to be quite a good
likeness, and there can be no question as to the superiority, in an
artistic sense, of the carbons. And I agree with you that the shadows
are less harsh in the red than in the sepia. Who is the photographer?”

He picked up the red print and, turning it over, looked at the back.
Then, finding that the back of the card was blank, he picked up the
sepia print and inspected it in the same way, but with the same
result. There was no photographer’s name either on the back or front.

“I have an impression,” said Thorndyke, “that the carbons were done by
a City photographer. But my man will know. He got them for me.”

Bundy set the two photographs back in their places, still, as it
seemed to me, with the air of a man who is trying vainly to remember
something. But, at this moment, Mrs. Dunk entered with the soup
tureen, and we forthwith took our places at the table.

We had finished our soup, and I was proceeding to effect the
dismemberment of an enormous sole, when Bundy, having fortified
himself with a sip of Chablis, cast a malignant glance at Thorndyke.

“I have got some bad news for you, Doctor,” said he.

“Which doctor are you addressing?” Thorndyke asked.

“There’s only one now,” replied Bundy. “T’other one has been degraded
to the rank of John.”

“That happens to be my rank, too,” observed Thorndyke.

“Oh, but I couldn’t think of taking such a liberty,” Bundy protested,
“though it is very gracious and condescending of you to suggest it.
No, your rank and title will continue to be that of doctor.”

“And what is your bad news?”

“It is a case of a lost opportunity,” said Bundy. “‘Of all the sad
words of tongue or pen,’ and so on. It might have been ten shillings.
But it never will now. Cobbledick has got your ten bob.”

“Do you mean that Cobbledick has found the missing key?”

“Even so, alackaday! The chance is gone for ever.”

“Where did he find it?” Thorndyke asked.

“Ah!” exclaimed Bundy. “There it is again. The tragedy of it! He
wasn’t looking for it at all. He just fell over it in a field where he
was searching for relics of Mrs. Frood.”

“Your description,” said Thorndyke, “is deficient in geographical
exactitude. Could you bring your ideas of locality to a somewhat
sharper focus? There are probably several fields in the neighbourhood
of Rochester.”

“So there are,” said Bundy. “Quite a lot. But this particular field
lies on the right, or starboard, side of a small thoroughfare called
Black Boy-lane.”

“Let me see,” said Thorndyke. “Isn’t that the lane that we went down
after leaving our friends on the day of the Great Perambulation?”

“Yes,” replied Bundy, looking at him in astonishment, “but how did you
know its name?” (He was, of course, not aware of my report to
Thorndyke describing the discoveries and the place.)

“That,” said Thorndyke, “is an irrelevant question. Now when you say
‘the right-hand side’----”

“I mean the right-hand side looking towards the town, of course. As a
matter of fact, Cobbledick found the key among the thistles near to
the fence, and quite close to the outside of the city wall.”

“How do you suppose it got there?” Thorndyke asked.

“I’ve no idea. Someone must have taken it out of the gate and thrown
it over the fence. That is obvious. But who could have done it I can’t
imagine. Of course, you suspect Cobbledick, but that is only
jealousy.”

The exchange of schoolboy repartee continued without a sensible pause
on either side. But yet I seemed to detect in Thorndyke’s manner a
certain reflectiveness underlying the levity of his verbal conflict
with Bundy; a reflectiveness that seemed to have had its origin in the
“news” that the latter had communicated. Of course, I had said
nothing, in my report, about the finding of the key. Why should I?
Those reports referred exclusively to matters connected with the
disappearance of poor Angelina. The loss and the recovery of the key
were items of mere local gossip with which Thorndyke could have no
concern excepting in connexion with Bundy’s facetious fiction. And yet
it had seemed to me that Thorndyke showed quite a serious interest in
the announcement. However, he made no further reference to the matter,
and the conversation drifted to other topics.

It was almost inevitable that, sooner or later, some reference should
be made to the discoveries in the lane. It was Bundy, of course, who
introduced the subject; and I was amused by the adroit way in which
Thorndyke conveyed the impression of complete ignorance, without
making any statement, and the patient manner in which he listened to
the account of the adventure, and even elicited amplified details by
judicious questions. But he eluded all Bundy’s efforts to extract an
opinion on the significance of the discoveries.

“But,” the latter protested, “you said that if I would give you the
facts, you would give me the explanation.”

“The explanation is obvious,” said Thorndyke. “If you found these
objects in the lane, they must have been dropped there.”

“Well, of course they must,” said Bundy. “That is quite obvious.”

“Exactly,” agreed Thorndyke. “That is what I am pointing out.”

“But why was the body being carried up the lane? And where was it
being carried to?”

“Ah,” protested Thorndyke, “but now you are going beyond your facts.
You haven’t proved that there was any body there at all.”

“But there must have been, or the things couldn’t have dropped off
it.”

“But you haven’t proved that they did drop off it. They may have, or
they may not. That is a question of fact; and as I impressed on you on
a previous occasion, evidence as to fact is the function of the common
witness. The expert witness explains the significance of facts
furnished by others. I have explained the facts that you have
produced, and now you ask me to explain something that isn’t a fact at
all. But that is not my function. I am an expert.”

“I see,” said Bundy; “and now I understand why judges are so down on
expert witnesses. It is my belief that they are a parcel of impostors.
Wasn’t Captain Bunsby an expert witness? Or was he only an oracle?”

“It is a distinction without a difference,” replied Thorndyke.
“Captain Bunsby is the classical instance of oracular safety. It was
impossible to dispute the correctness of his pronouncements.”

“Principally,” said I, “because no one could make head or tail of
them.”

“But that was the subtlety of the method,” said Thorndyke. “A
statement cannot be contested until it is understood. From which it
follows that if you would deliver a judgment that cannot be disputed,
you must take proper precautions against the risk of being
understood.”

Bundy adjusted his eye-glass and fixed on Thorndyke a glare of
counterfeit defiance. “I am going to take an early opportunity of
seeing you in the witness-box,” said he. “It will be the treat of my
life.”

“I must try to give you that treat,” replied Thorndyke. “I am sure you
will be highly entertained, but I don’t think you will be able to
dispute my evidence.”

“I don’t suppose I shall,” Bundy retorted with a grin, “if it is of
the same brand as the sample that I have heard.”

Here the arrival of Mrs. Dunk with the coffee ushered in a truce
between the disputants, and when I had filled the cups Thorndyke
changed the subject by recalling the incidents of our perambulation
with Japp and Mr. Willard; and Bundy, apparently considering that
enough chaff had been cut for one evening, entered into a discussion
on the conditions of life in mediæval Rochester with a zest and
earnestness that came as a refreshing change after so much frivolity.
So the evening passed pleasantly away until ten o’clock, when Bundy
rose to depart.

“Shall we see him home, Thorndyke?” said I. “We can do with a walk
after our pow-wow.”

“Somebody ought to see him home,” said Thorndyke. “He looks
comparatively sober now, but wait till he gets out into the air.”
(Bundy’s almost ascetic abstemiousness in respect of wine, I should
explain, had become a mild joke between us.) “But I think I won’t join
the bacchanalian procession. I have a letter to write, and I can get
it done and posted by the time you come back.”

As we walked towards the office arm-in-arm--Bundy keeping up the
fiction of a slight unsteadiness of gait--my guest once more expressed
enjoyment of our little festivals.

“I suppose,” said he, “Dr. Thorndyke is really quite a big bug in his
way.”

“Yes,” I replied; “he is in the very front rank; in fact, I should say
that he is the greatest living authority on his subject.”

“Yes,” said Bundy, thoughtfully, “one feels that he is a great man,
although he is so friendly and so perfectly free from side. I hope I
don’t cheek him too much.”

“He doesn’t seem to resent it,” I answered, “and he certainly doesn’t
object to your society. He expressly said, when he wrote last, that he
hoped to see something of you.”

“That was awfully nice of him,” Bundy said with very evident
gratification; and he added, after a pause: “Lord! John, what a
windfall it was for me when you came down with that letter from old
Turcival. It has made life a different thing for me.”

“I am glad to hear it, Peter,” said I; “but you haven’t got all the
benefit. It was a bit of luck for me to strike a live bishop in my new
habitat, and a Rumtifoozlish one at that. But here we are at the
episcopal palace. Shall I assist your lordship up the steps?”

We carried out the farce to its foolish end, staggering together up
the steps, at the top of which I propped him securely against the door
and rang the bell, with the comfortable certainty that there was no
one in the house to disturb.

“Good night, John, old chap,” he said cordially, as I retired.

“Good night, Peter, my child,” I responded; and so took my way
homeward to my other guest.

I arrived at my house in time to meet Thorndyke returning from the
adjacent pillar-box, and we went in together.

“Well,” said he, “I suppose we had better turn in, according to what
is, I believe, the custom of this household, and turn out betimes in
the morning, for a visit, perhaps, to Black Boy-lane.”

“Yes,” I replied, “we may as well turn in now. You are not going to
leave these photographs there, are you?”

“They are your photographs,” he replied; “that is, if you care to have
them. I brought them down for you.”

I thanked him very warmly for the gift, and gathered up the portraits
carefully, replacing them, for the present, in their box. Then we
turned out the lights and made our way up to our respective bedrooms.

At breakfast on the following morning Thorndyke opened the subject of
our investigation by cross-examining me on the matter of my report,
and the more detailed account that Bundy had given.

“What does Sergeant Cobbledick think of the new developments?” he
asked, when I had given him all the detail that I could.

“In a way he is encouraged. He is glad to get something more definite
to work on. But for the present he seems to be high and dry. He gave
me quite a learned exposition of the possibilities of the case, but he
had to admit when he had finished that he was still in the dark so far
as any final conclusion was concerned. He even suggested that I should
put the facts before you--he recognized you when we met him on the
road near Blue Boar Pier--and ask if you could make any suggestion.”

“Can you recall the sergeant’s exposition of the case?”

“I think so. It made rather an impression on me at the time,” and here
I repeated, as well as I could remember them, the various inferences
that Cobbledick had drawn from the presence in the lane of the things
that we had found. Thorndyke listened with deep attention, nodding his
head approvingly as each point was made.

“A very admirable analysis, Strangeways,” he said when I had finished.
“It does the sergeant great credit. So far as it goes, it is an
excellent interpretation of the facts that are in his possession.
There are, perhaps, one or two points that he has overlooked.”

“If there are,” said I, “it would be a great kindness to draw his
attention to them. He is naturally anxious to get on with the case,
and he has taken endless trouble over it.”

“I shall be very glad to give him a hint or two,” said Thorndyke.
“After breakfast I should like to go over the ground with you, and
then we might go along to the station and see if he is in his office.”

I agreed to this program, and as soon as we had finished our breakfast
we went forth, making our way by Free School-lane and The Common to
the marshes west of Gas House-road. From there we entered Black
Boy-lane at the lower end, and slowly followed its windings, Thorndyke
looking about him attentively, and occasionally peering over the
fences, which his stature enabled him to do without climbing. At the
top of the lane, where it opened into a paved thoroughfare, we
observed no less a personage than Sergeant Cobbledick, standing on the
pavement and looking at the few adjacent houses with an expression of
profound speculation. His speculative attitude changed suddenly to one
of eager interest when he saw us; and on my presenting him to
Thorndyke, he stood stiffly at “attention” and raised his hat with an
air that I can only describe as reverent.

“Dr. Strangeways was telling me, just now,” said Thorndyke, “of your
very interesting observations on these new developments. He also said
that you would like to talk the matter over with me.”

“I should, indeed, sir,” the sergeant said, earnestly; “and if I might
suggest it, my office will be very quiet, being Sunday, and I could
show you the things that have been found, if you would like to see
them.”

“As to the things that have been found,” said Thorndyke, “I am
prepared to take them as read. They have been properly identified. But
we could certainly talk more conveniently in your office.”

In a few minutes we turned into a narrow street which brought us to
the side of the Guildhall, and the sergeant, having shown us into his
office and given some instructions to a constable, entered and locked
the door.

“Now, Sergeant,” said Thorndyke, “tell us what your difficulty is.”

“I’ve got several difficulties, Sir,” replied Cobbledick. “In the
first place, here is a body being carried up the lane. You agree with
me, Sir, that it was going up and not down?”

“Yes; your reasons seem quite conclusive.”

“Well, then, Sir, the next question is, was this a dead body, or was
the woman drugged or insensible? The fact that she was being taken
from the river towards the town suggests that she was alive and being
taken to some house where she could be hidden; but, of course, a dead
body might be taken to a house to be destroyed by burning or to be
dismembered or even buried, say under the cellar. I must say my own
feeling is that it was a dead body.”

“The reasons you gave Dr. Strangeways for thinking so seem to be quite
sound. Let us proceed on the assumption that it was a dead body.”

“Well, Sir,” said Cobbledick, gloomily, “there you are. That’s all. We
have got a body brought up from the river. We can trace it up to near
the top of the lane. But there we lose it. It seems to have vanished
into smoke. It was being taken up into the town; but where? There’s
nothing to show. We come out into the paved streets, and, of course,
there isn’t a trace. We seem to have come to the end of our clues; and
I am very much afraid that we shan’t get any more.”

“There,” said Thorndyke, “I am inclined to agree with you, Sergeant.
You won’t get any more clues for the simple reason that you have got
them all.”

“Got them all!” exclaimed Cobbledick, staring in amazement at
Thorndyke.

“Yes,” was the calm reply; “at least, that is how it appears to me.
Your business now is not to search for more clues but to extract the
meaning from the facts that you possess. Come, now, Sergeant,” he
continued, “let us take a bird’s-eye view of the case, as it were,
reconstructing the investigation in a sort of synopsis. I will read
the entries from my note-book.”

“On Saturday, the 26th of April, Mrs. Frood disappeared. On the 1st of
May the brooch was found at the pawn-brokers. On the 7th of May the
box of tablets and the bag were found on the shore at Chatham,
apparently fixing the place of the crime. On the 9th of May the scarf
was found at Blue Boar Head. On the 15th of May a shoe was found in
the creek between Blue Boar Head and Gas House Point. On the 25th of
May the second shoe was found on the gridiron near Gas House Point. On
the 20th of June a hat-pin was found on the shore a little west of the
last spot; always creeping steadily up the river, you notice.”

“Yes,” said Cobbledick, “I noticed that, and I’m hanged if I can
account for it in any way.”

“Never mind,” said Thorndyke. “Just note the fact. Then on the 14th of
July four articles were found; near the bottom of the lane a button;
near the middle of the lane a hat-pin, and, abreast of it in the
field, the hat, itself. Finally, at the top of the lane, in the field,
you found the missing key.”

“I don’t see what the key has got to do with it,” said the sergeant.
“It don’t seem to me to be in the picture.”

“Doesn’t it?” said Thorndyke. “Just consider a moment, Sergeant. But
perhaps you have forgotten the date on which the key disappeared?”

“I don’t know that I ever noticed when it was lost.”

“It wasn’t lost,” said Thorndyke. “It was taken away--probably out of
the gate--and afterwards thrown over the fence. But I daresay Dr.
Strangeways can give you the date.”

I reflected for a few moments. “Let me see,” said I. “It was a good
while ago, and I remember that it was a Saturday, because the men who
were filling the holes in the city wall had knocked off at noon for a
week-end. Now when was it? I went to the wine merchant’s that day,
and--” I paused with a sudden shock of recollection. “Why!” I
exclaimed. “It was _the_ Saturday; the day Mrs. Frood disappeared!”

Cobbledick seemed to stiffen in his chair as he suddenly turned a
startled look at Thorndyke.

“Yes,” agreed the latter; “the key disappeared during the morning of
the 26th of April and Mrs. Frood disappeared on the evening of the
same day. That is a coincidence in time. And if you consider what gate
it was that this key unlocked; that it gave entrance--and also
excluded entrance--to an isolated, enclosed area of waste land in
which excavations and fillings-in were actually taking place; I think
you will agree that there is matter for investigation.”

As Thorndyke was speaking Cobbledick’s eyes opened wider and wider,
and his mouth exhibited a like change.

“Good Lord, Sir!” he exclaimed at length, “you mean to say----”

“No, I don’t,” Thorndyke interrupted with a smile. “I am merely
drawing your attention to certain facts which seem to have escaped it.
You said that there was no hint of a place to which the body could
have been conveyed. I point out a hint which you have overlooked. That
is all.”

“It is a pretty broad hint, too,” said Cobbledick, “and I am going to
lose no time in acting on it. Do you happen to know, Doctor, who
employed the workmen?”

“I gathered that Japp and Bundy had the contract to repair the wall.
At any rate, they were supervising the work, and they will be able to
tell you where to find the foreman. Probably they have a complete
record of the progress of the work. You know Mr. Japp’s address on
Boley Hill, I suppose, and Mr. Bundy lives over the office.”

“I’ll call on him at once,” said Cobbledick, “and see if he can give
me the particulars, and I’ll get him to lend me the key. I suppose you
two gentlemen wouldn’t care to come and have a look at the place with
me?”

“I don’t see why not,” said Thorndyke. “But I particularly wish not to
appear in connexion with the case, so I will ask you to say nothing to
anyone of your having spoken to me about it, and, of course, we go to
the place alone.”

“Certainly,” the sergeant agreed emphatically. “We don’t want any
outsiders with us. Then if you will wait for me here I will get back
as quickly as I can. I hope Mr. Bundy is at home.”

He snatched up his hat and darted out of the office, full of hope and
high spirits. Thorndyke’s suggestion had rejuvenated him.

“It seems to me,” I said, when he had gone, “a rather remarkable thing
that you should have remembered all the circumstances of the loss of
this key.”

“It isn’t really remarkable at all,” he replied. “I heard of it after
the woman had disappeared. But as soon as she had disappeared, the
loss of this particular key at this particular time became a fact of
possible evidential importance. It was a fact that had to be noted and
remembered. The connexion of the tragedy with the river seemed to
exclude it for a time; but the discoveries in the lane at once revived
its importance. The fundamental rule, Strangeways, of all criminal
investigation is to note everything, relevant or irrelevant, and
forget nothing.”

“It is an excellent rule,” said I, “but it must be a mighty difficult
one to carry out”; and for a while we sat, each immersed in his own
reflections.

The sergeant returned in an incredibly short space of time, and he
burst into the office with a beaming face, flourishing the key. “I
found him at home,” said he, “and I’ve got all the necessary
particulars, so we can take a preliminary look round.” He held the
door open, and when we had passed out, he led the way down the little
street at a pace that would have done credit to a sporting
lamp-lighter. A very few minutes brought us to the gate, and when he
had opened it and locked it behind us, he stood looking round the
weed-grown enclosure as if doubtful where to begin.

“Which patch in the wall is the one they were working at when the key
disappeared?” Thorndyke asked.

“The last but one to the left,” was the reply.

“Then we had better have a look at that, first,” said Thorndyke. “It
was a ready-made excavation.”

We advanced towards the ragged patch in the wall, and as we drew near
I looked at it with a tumult of emotions that swamped mere anxiety and
expectation. I could see what Thorndyke thought, and that perception
amounted almost to conviction. Meanwhile, my colleague and the
sergeant stepped close up to the patch and minutely examined the rough
and slovenly joints of the stonework.

“There is no trace of its having been opened,” said Thorndyke. “But
there wouldn’t be. I think we had better scrape up the earth at the
foot of the wall. Something might easily have been dropped and trodden
in in the darkness.” He looked towards the shed, in which a couple of
empty lime barrels still remained, and, perceiving there a decrepit
shovel, he went and fetched it. Returning with it, he proceeded to
turn up the surface of the ground at the foot of the wall, depositing
each shovelful of earth on a bare spot, and spreading it out
carefully. For some time there was no result, but he continued
methodically, working from one end of the patch towards the other.
Suddenly Cobbledick uttered an exclamation and stooped over a freshly
deposited shovelful.

“By the Lord!” he ejaculated, “it is a true bill! You were quite
right, sir.” He stood up, holding out between his finger and thumb a
small bronze button bearing an embossed Tudor Rose. Thorndyke glanced
at me as I took the button from the sergeant and examined it.

“Yes,” I said, “it is unquestionably one of her buttons.”

“Then,” said he, “we have got our answer. The solution of the mystery
is contained in that patch of new rubble.”

The sergeant’s delight and gratitude were quite pathetic. Again and
again he reiterated his thanks, regardless of Thorndyke’s disclaimers
and commendations of the officer’s own skilful and patient
investigation.

“All the same,” said Cobbledick, as he locked the gate and pocketed
the key, “we haven’t solved the whole problem. We may say that we have
found the body; but the problem of the crime and the criminal remains.
I suppose, sir, you don’t see any glimmer of light in that direction?”

“A glimmer, perhaps,” replied Thorndyke, “but it may turn out to be
but a mirage. Let us see the body. It may have a clearer message for
us than we expect.”

Beyond this rather cryptic suggestion he refused to commit himself;
nor, when we had parted from the sergeant, could I get anything more
definite out of him.

“It is useless to speculate,” he said, by way of closing the subject.
“We think that we know what is inside that wall. We may be right, but
we may possibly be wrong. A few hours will settle our doubts. If the
body is there, it may tell us all that we want to know.”

This last observation left me more puzzled than ever. The condition of
the body might, and probably would, reveal the cause of death and the
nature of the crime; but it was difficult to see how it could point
out the identity of the murderer. However, the subject was closed for
the time being, and Thorndyke resolutely refused to reopen it until
the fresh data were available.




 CHAPTER XV.
 THE END OF THE TRAIL

Shortly after breakfast on the following morning Sergeant Cobbledick
made his appearance at my house. I found him in the consulting-room,
walking about on tip-toe with his hat balanced in his hands, and
evidently in a state of extreme nervous tension.

“I have got everything in train, Doctor,” said he, declining a seat.
“I dug up the foreman yesterday evening and he dug up one of his mates
to give him a hand, if necessary; and I have the authority to open the
wall. So we are all ready to begin. The two men have gone down to the
place with their tools, and Mr. Bundy has gone with them to let them
in. He didn’t much want to go, but I thought it best that either he or
Mr. Japp should be present. It is their wall, so to speak. I suppose
you are coming to see the job done.”

“Is there any need for me to be there?” I asked.

Cobbledick looked at me in surprise. He had evidently assumed that I
should be eager to see what happened. “Well,” he replied, “you are the
principal witness to the identity of the remains. You saw her last,
you know. What is your objection, Doctor?”

I was not in a position to answer this question. I could not tell him
what this last and most horrible search meant to me; and apart from my
personal feelings in regard to poor Angelina, there was no objection
at all, but, on the contrary, every reason why I should be present.

“It isn’t a very pleasant affair,” I replied, “seeing that I knew the
lady rather well. However, if you think I had better be there, I will
come down with you.”

“I certainly think your presence would be a help,” said he. “We don’t
know what may turn up, and you know more about her than anybody else.”

Accordingly, I walked down with him, and when he had admitted me with
his key--Bundy had presumably used the duplicate--he closed the gate
and locked it from within. The actual operations had not yet
commenced, but the foreman and his mate were standing by the wall,
conversing affably with Bundy, who looked nervous and uncomfortable,
evidently relishing his position no more than I did mine.

“This is a gruesome affair, John, isn’t it?” he said in a low voice.
“I don’t see why old Cobbledick wanted to drag us into it. It will be
an awful moment when they uncover her, if she is really there. I’m
frightfully sorry for you, old chap.”

“I should have had to see the body in any case,” said I; “and this is
less horrible than the river.”

Here my attention was attracted by the foreman, who had just drawn a
long, horizontal chalk line across the patch of new rubble, a little
below the middle.

“That’s about the place where we left off that Saturday, so far as I
remember,” he said. “We had built up the outer case, and we filled in
the hollow with loose bricks and stones, but we didn’t put any mortar
to them until Monday morning. Then we mixed up a lot of mortar, quite
thin, so that it would run, and poured it on top of the loose stuff.”

“Rum way of building a wall, isn’t it?” observed Cobbledick.

The foreman grinned. “It ain’t what you’d call the highest class of
masonry,” he admitted. “But what can you expect to do with a gang of
corner-boys who’ve never done a job of real work in their lives?”

“No, that’s true,” said the Sergeant. “But you made a soft job for the
grave-diggers, didn’t you? Why they’d only got to pick out the loose
stuff and then dump it back on top when they’d put the body in. Then
you came along on Monday morning and finished the job for them with
one or two bucketsful of liquid mortar. How long would it have taken
to pick out that loose stuff?”

“Lord bless yer,” was the answer, “one man who meant business could
have picked the whole lot out by hand in an hour; and he could have
chucked it back in less. As you say, Sergeant, it was a soft job.”

While they had been talking, the foreman’s familiar demon had been
making a tentative attack on the outer casing with a great,
chisel-ended steel bar and a mason’s hammer. The foreman now came to
his aid with a sledge hammer, the first stroke of which caused the
shoddy masonry to crack in all directions like pie-crust. Then the
fractured pieces of the outer shell were prised off, revealing the
“loose stuff” within. And uncommonly loose it was; so loose that the
unjoined bricks and stones, with their adherent gouts of mortar, came
away at the lightest touch of the great crow-bar.

As soon as a breach had been made at the top of the patch, the
labourer climbed up and began flinging out the separated bricks and
stones. Then he attacked a fresh course of the outer shell with a
pick, and so exposed a fresh layer of the loose filling.

“There’ll be a fresh job for the unemployed to build this up again,”
the sergeant observed with a sardonic smile.

“Ah,” replied the foreman, “there generally is a fresh job when you
take on a crowd of casuals. Wonderful provident men are casuals. Don’t
they take no thought for the morrow? What O!”

At this moment the labourer stood upright on his perch and laid down
his pick. “Well, I’m blowed!” he exclaimed. “This is a rum go, this
is.”

“What’s a rum go?” demanded the foreman.

“Why, here’s a whole bed of dry quick-lime,” was the reply.

“Ha!” exclaimed the sergeant, knitting his brows anxiously.

The foreman scrambled up, and after a brief inspection confirmed the
man’s statement. “Quick-lime it is, sure enough. Just hand me up that
shovel, Sergeant.”

“Be careful,” Cobbledick admonished, as he passed the shovel up.
“Don’t forget what there probably is underneath.”

The foreman took the shovel and began very cautiously to scrape away
the surface, flinging the scrapings of lime out on to the ground,
where they were eagerly scrutinized by the sergeant, while the
labourer picked out the larger lumps and cast them down. Thus the work
went on for about a quarter of an hour, without any result beyond the
accumulation on the ground below of a small heap of lime. At length I
noticed the foreman pause and look attentively at the lime that he had
just scraped up in his shovel.

“Here’s something that I don’t fancy any of our men put in,” he said,
picking the object out and handing it down to the Sergeant. The latter
took it from him and held it out for me to see. It was another of
Angelina’s coat buttons.

In the course of the next few minutes two more buttons came to light,
and almost immediately afterwards I saw the labourer stoop suddenly
and stare down at the lime with an expression that made my flesh
creep, as he pointed something out to the foreman.

“Ah!” the latter exclaimed. “Here she is! But, my word! There ain’t
much left of her. Look at this, Sergeant.”

Very gingerly, and with an air of shuddering distaste, he picked
something out of the lime and held it up; and even at that distance I
could see that it was a human ulna. Cobbledick took it from him with
the same distasteful and almost fearful manner, and held it towards me
for inspection. I glanced at it and looked away. “Yes,” I said. “It is
a human arm bone.”

On this, Cobbledick beckoned for the labourer to come down, and,
taking out his official note-book, wrote something in pencil and tore
out the leaf.

“Take this down to the station and give it to Sergeant Brown. He will
tell you what else to do.” He gave the paper to the man, and having
let him out of the gate, came back and climbed up to the exposed
surface of the excavation, where I saw him draw on a pair of gloves
and then stoop and begin to pick over the lime.

“This is a horrid business, isn’t it?” said Bundy. “Why the deuce
couldn’t Cobbledick carry on by himself? I don’t see that it is our
affair. Do you think we need stay?”

“I don’t see why you need. You have finished your part of the
business. You have seen the wall opened. I am afraid I must stay a
little longer, as Cobbledick may want me to identify some of the other
objects that may be found. But I shan’t stay very long. There is
really no question of the identity of the body, and there is no doubt
now that the body is there. Detailed identification is a matter for
the coroner.”

As we were speaking, we walked slowly away from the wall among the
mounds of rubbish, now beginning to be hidden under a dense growth of
nettles, rag-wort and thistles. It was a desolate, neglected place,
sordid of aspect and contrasting unpleasantly in its modern squalor
with the dignified decay of the ancient wall. We had reached the
further fence and were just turning about, when the sergeant hailed me
with a note of excitement in his voice. I hurried across and found him
standing up with his eyes fixed on something that lay in the palm of
his gloved hand.

“This seems to be the ring that you described to me, Doctor,” said he.
“Will you just take a look at it?”

He reached down and I received in my hand the little trinket of
deep-toned, yellow gold that I remembered so well. I turned it over in
my palm, and as I looked on its mystical signs, its crude, barbaric
workmanship and the initials “A. C.” scratched inside, the scene in
that dimly-lighted room--years ago, it seemed to me now--rose before
me like a vision. I saw the gracious figure in the red glow of the
lamp and heard the voice that was never again to sound in my ears,
telling the story of the little bauble, and for a few moments, the
dreadful present faded into the irredeemable past.

“There isn’t any doubt about it, is there, Doctor?” the sergeant asked
anxiously.

“None, whatever,” I replied. “It is unquestionably Mrs. Frood’s ring.”

“That’s a mercy,” said Cobbledick; “because we shall want every atom
of identification that we can get. The body isn’t going to help us
much. This lime has done its work to a finish. There’s nothing left,
so far as I can see, but the skeleton and the bits of metal belonging
to the clothing. Would you like to come up and have a look, Doctor?
There isn’t much to see yet, but I have uncovered some of the bones.”

“I don’t think I will come up, Sergeant, thank you,” said I. “When you
have finished, I shall have to look over what has been found, as I
shall have to give evidence at the inquest. And I think I need hardly
stay any longer. There is no doubt now about the identity, so far as
we are concerned, at any rate.”

“No,” he agreed. “There is no doubt in my mind, so I need not keep you
any longer if you want to be off. But, before you go, there is one
little matter that I should like to speak to you about.” He climbed
down to the ground, and, walking away with me a little distance,
continued: “You see, Doctor, some medical man will have to examine the
remains, so as to give evidence before the coroner. If it is
impossible to identify them as the remains of Mrs. Frood, it will have
to be given in evidence that they are the remains of a person who
might have been Mrs. Frood; that they are the remains of a woman of
about her size and age, I mean. Of course, the choice of the medical
witness doesn’t rest with the police, but if you would care to take on
the job, our recommendation would have weight with the coroner. You
see, you are the most suitable person to make the examination, as you
actually knew her.”

I shook my head emphatically. “For that very reason, Sergeant, I
couldn’t possibly undertake the duty. Even doctors have feelings, you
know. Just imagine how you would feel, yourself, pawing over the bones
of a woman who had once been your friend.”

Cobbledick looked disappointed. “Yes,” he admitted, “I suppose there
is something in what you say. But I didn’t think doctors troubled
about such things very much; and you have got such an eye for
detail--and such a memory. However, if you’d rather not, there is an
end of the matter.”

He climbed back regretfully to the opening in the wall, and I rejoined
Bundy. “I have finished here now,” said I. “That was a ring of hers
that Cobbledick had found. Are you staying any longer?”

“Not if you are going away,” he replied. “I am not wanted now, and I
can’t stick this charnel-house atmosphere; it is getting on my nerves.
Let us clear out.”

We walked towards the entrance with a feeling of relief at escaping
from the gruesome place, and had arrived within a few yards of it when
there came a loud knocking at the gate, at which Bundy started
visibly.

“Good Lord!” he exclaimed, “it’s like Macbeth. Here, take my key and
let the beggars in, whoever they are.”

I unlocked the gate and threw it open, when I saw, standing in the
lane, two men, bearing on their shoulders a rough, unpainted coffin,
and accompanied by the labourer, who carried a large sieve. I stood
aside to let them pass in, and when they had entered, Bundy and I
walked out, shutting and locking the gate after us. We made our way up
the lane in silence, for there was little to say but much to think
about; indeed, I would sooner have been alone, but the gruesome
atmosphere of the place we had come from seemed to have affected
Bundy’s spirits so much that I thought it only kind to ask him to come
back to lunch with me; an invitation that he accepted with avidity.

During lunch we discussed the tragic discovery, and Bundy, now that he
had escaped from physical contact with the relics of mortality, showed
his usual shrewd common sense.

“Well,” he said, “the mystery of poor Angelina Frood is solved at
last--at least, so far as it is ever likely to be.”

“I hope not,” I replied, “for the essential point of the mystery is
not solved at all. It has only just been completely propounded. We now
know beyond a doubt that she was murdered, and that the murder was a
deliberate crime, planned in advance. What we want to know--at least,
what I want to know, and shall never rest until I do know--is, who
committed this diabolical crime?”

“I am afraid you never will know, John,” said he. “There doesn’t seem
to be the faintest clue.”

“What do you mean?” I demanded. “You seem to have forgotten Nicholas
Frood.”

Bundy shook his head. “You are deluding yourself, John. Nicholas
seems, from your account of him, to be quite capable of having
murdered his wife. But is there anything to connect him with the
crime? If there is, you have never told me of it. And the law demands
positive evidence. You can’t charge a man with murder because he seems
a likely person and you don’t know of anybody else. What have you got
against him in connexion with this present affair?”

“Well, for instance, I know that he was prowling about this town, and
that he was trying to find out where she lived.”

“But why not?” demanded Bundy. “She was a runaway wife, and he was her
husband.”

“Then I happen to have noticed that he carried a sheath-knife.”

“But do you know that she was killed with a sheath-knife?”

“No, I don’t,” I answered savagely. “But I say again that I shall
never rest until the price of her death has been paid. There must be
some clue. The murder could not have been committed without a motive,
and it must be possible to discover what that motive was. Somebody
must have stood to benefit in some way by her death; and I am going to
find that person, or those persons, if I give up the rest of my life
to the search.”

“I am sorry to hear you say that, John,” he said as he rose to depart.
“It sounds as if you were prepared to spend the rest of your life
chasing a will-o’-the-wisp. But we are premature. The inquest may
bring to light some new evidence that will put the police on the
murderer’s track. You must remember that they have been engaged in
tracing the body up to now. When the inquest has been held and the
facts are known they will be able to begin the search for the
murderers. And I wish them and you good luck.”

I was rather glad when he was gone, for his dispassionate estimate of
the difficulties of the case only served to confirm my own secret
hopelessness. For I could not deny that these wretches seemed to have
covered up their tracks completely. In the three months that had
passed no whisper of any suspicious circumstance had been heard. From
the moment when poor Angelina had faded from my sight into the fog to
that of her dreadful reappearance in the old wall, no human eye seemed
to have seen her. And now that she had come back, what had she to tell
us of the events of that awful night? The very body, on which
Thorndyke had relied for evidence, at least, of the manner of the
crime, had dwindled to a mere skeleton such as might have been exhumed
from some ancient tomb. The cunning of the murderers had outwitted
even Thorndyke.

The thought of my friend reminded me that I had to report to him the
results of the opening of the wall; results very different from what
he had anticipated when he had given the sergeant the too-fruitful
hint. I accordingly wrote out a detailed report, so far as my
information went; but I held it back until the last post in case
anything further should come to my knowledge. And it was just as well
that I did; for about eight o’clock, Cobbledick called to give me the
latest tidings.

“Well, Doctor,” he said, with a smile of concentrated benevolence, “I
have got everything in going order. I have seen the coroner and made
out a list of witnesses. You are one of them, of course; in fact, you
are the star-witness. You were the last person to see her alive, and
you were present at the exhumation. Dr. Baines--he’s rather a
scientific gentleman--is to make the post-mortem examination, and tell
us the cause of death, if he can. He won’t have much to go on. The
lime has eaten up everything--it would, naturally, after three
months--but the bones look quite uninjured, so far as I could judge.”

“When does the inquest open?” I asked.

“The day after to-morrow. I’ve got your summons with me, and I may as
well give it to you now.”

I looked at the little blue paper and put it in my pocket-book. “Do
you think the coroner will get through the case in one day?” I asked.

“No, I am sure he won’t,” replied Cobbledick. “It is an important
case, and there will be a lot of witnesses. There will be the evidence
as to the building of the wall; then the opening of it and the
description of what we found in it; then the identification of the
remains--that is you, principally; and then there will be all the
other evidence, the pawnbroker, Israel Bangs, Hooper, and the others.
And then, of course, there will be the question as to the guilty
parties. That is the most important of all.”

“I didn’t know you had any evidence on that subject,” said I.

“I haven’t much,” he replied. “From the time when she disappeared
nobody saw her alive or dead, and, of course, nothing has ever been
heard of any occurrence that might indicate a crime. All we have to go
on--and it is mighty little--is the fact that she was hiding from her
husband, and that he was trying to find her. Also that he had made one
attempt on her life. That is where your evidence will come in, and
that of the matron at the ‘Poor Travellers.’ I’ve had a talk with
her.”

“Do you know anything of Frood’s movements about the time of the
disappearance?”

“Practically nothing, excepting that he went away from his lodgings
the day before. You see, we were not in a position to start tracing
possible criminals. We had no real evidence of any crime. We knew that
the woman had disappeared, and she appeared to have got into the
river. But there was nothing to show how. It looked suspicious, but it
wasn’t a case. So long as no body was forthcoming there was no
evidence of death, and nobody could have been charged. Even if we had
found the body in the river, unless there had been distinct traces of
violence, it would have been merely a case of ‘found dead,’ or ‘found
drowned.’ But now the affair is on a different footing entirely. The
body has been discovered under conditions which furnish prima facie
evidence of murder, whatever the cause of death may turn out to have
been. There is sure to be a verdict of wilful murder--not that the
police are dependent on the coroner’s verdict. So now we can get a
move on and look for the murderer.”

“What chance do you think there is of finding him?” I asked.

“Well,” said Cobbledick with a benevolent smile, “we mustn’t be too
cock-sure. But, leaving the husband out of the question and taking the
broad facts, it doesn’t look so unpromising. This wasn’t a casual
crime--fortunately. There’s nothing so hopeless as a casual crime,
done for mere petty robbery. But this crime was thought out. The place
of burial was selected in advance. The key of the place was obtained,
so that the murderer could not only get in but could lock himself--or
more probably themselves--in and work secure from chance disturbance.
And the time seems to have been selected; a week-end, with two whole
nights to do the job in. All this points to very definite
premeditation; and that points to a very definite motive. The person
who planned this crime had something considerable to gain by Mrs.
Frood’s death; it may have been profit or it may have been the
satisfaction of revenge.

“Well, that is a pretty good start. When we know what property she
had, who comes into it at her death, if any of it is missing, and if
so, what has become of it; we can judge concerning the first case. And
if we find that she had any enemies besides her husband; anyone whom
she had injured or who owed her a grudge; then we can judge of the
second case.

“Then there is another set of facts. This murderer couldn’t have been
a complete stranger to the place. He knew about the wall and what was
going on there. He knew the river and he possessed, or had command of,
a boat. He knew the waterside premises and he knew his way--or had
someone to show him the way--across the marshes and up Black Boy-lane.
One, at least, of the persons concerned in this affair was a local man
who knew the place well. So you see, Doctor, we have got something to
go on, after all.”

I listened to the sergeant’s exposition with deep interest and no
little revival of my drooping hopes. It was a most able summary of the
case, and I felt that I should have liked Thorndyke to hear it; in
fact, I determined to embody it in the amplification of my report.
With the facts thus fully and lucidly collated, it did really seem as
though the perpetrator of this foul crime must inevitably fall into
our hands. Having refreshed the sergeant with a couple of glasses of
port, I shook his hand warmly and wished him the best of success in
the investigation that he was conducting with so much ability.

When he had gone I wrote a full account of our interview to add to my
previous report, and expressed the hope that Thorndyke would be able
to be present at the inquest, when I myself should “be and appear” at
the appointed place to give evidence on the day after the morrow.




 CHAPTER XVI.
 THE INQUIRY AND A SURPRISE

On the morning of the inquest I started from my house well in
advance of time, and in a distinctly uncomfortable frame of mind.
Perhaps it was that the formal inquiry brought home to me with extra
vividness the certainty that my beloved friend was gone from me for
ever, and that she had died in circumstances of tragedy and horror.
Not that I had ever had any doubt, but now the realization was more
intense. Again, I should have to give evidence. I should have to
reconstitute for the information of strangers scenes and events that
had for me a certain sacred intimacy. And then, above all, I should
have to view--and that not cursorily--the decayed remains of the woman
who had been so much to me. That would be naturally expected from a
medical man and no one would guess at what it would cost me to bring
myself to this last dreadful meeting.

Walking down the High-street thus wrapped in gloomy reflections, it
was with mixed feelings that I observed Bundy advancing slowly towards
me, having evidently awaited my arrival. In some respects I would
sooner have been alone, and yet his kindly, sympathetic companionship
was not altogether unwelcome.

“Good morning, John,” said he. “I hope I am not _de trop_. It is a
melancholy errand for you, poor old chap, and I can’t do much to make
it less so, but I thought we might walk down together. You know how
sorry I am for you, John.”

“Yes, I know and appreciate, and I am always glad to see you, Peter.
But why are you going there? Have you had a summons?”

“No, I have no information to give. But I am interested in the case,
of course, so I am going to attend as a spectator. So is Japp, though
he is really a legitimately interested party. In fact, I am rather
surprised they didn’t summon him as a witness.”

“So am I. He really knows more about the poor girl than I do. But, of
course, he knows nothing of the circumstances of her death.”

By this time we had arrived at the Guildhall, and here we encountered
Sergeant Cobbledick, who was evidently on the look-out for me.

“I am glad you came early, Doctor,” said he. “I want you just to pop
round to the mortuary. You know the way. There’s a tray by the side of
the coffin with all her belongings on it. I’ll get you to take a
careful look at them, so that you can tell the jury that they are
really her things. And you had better run your eye over the remains.
You might be able to spot something of importance. At any rate, they
will expect you to have viewed the body, as you are the principal
witness to its identity. I’ve told the constable on duty to let you
in. And, of course, you can go in, too, Mr. Bundy, if you want to.”

“I don’t think I do, thank you,” replied Bundy. But he walked round
with me to the mortuary, where the constable unlocked the door as he
saw us approaching. I mentioned my name to the officer, but he knew me
by sight, and now held the door open and followed me in, while Bundy
halted at the threshold, and stood, rather pale and awe-stricken,
looking in at the long table and its gruesome burden.

The tray of which Cobbledick had spoken was covered with a white
table-cloth, and on this the various objects were arranged
symmetrically like the exhibits in a museum. At the top was the hat,
flanked on either side by a silver-headed hat-pin. The carefully
smoothed scarf was spread across horizontally, the six coat-buttons
were arranged in a straight vertical line, and the two shoes were
placed at the bottom centre. At one side was the hand-bag, and at the
other, to balance it, the handkerchief with its neatly-embroidered
initials; and on this were placed the Zodiac ring, the wedding ring,
the box of tablets, and the brooch. On the lateral spaces the various
other objects were arranged with the same meticulous care for
symmetrical effect: a neat row of hair pins, a row of hooks and eyes,
one or two rows of buttons from the dress and under-garments, the
little metal jaws of the purse, two rows of coins, silver and bronze,
a pair of glove-fasteners with scorched fragments of leather adhering,
a little pearl-handled knife, a number of metal clasps and fastenings
and other small metallic objects derived from the various garments,
and a few fragments of textiles, scorched as if by fire; a couple of
brown shreds, apparently from the stockings, a cindery fragment of the
brown coat, and a few charred and brittle tatters of linen.

I looked over the pitiful collection while the constable stood near
the door and probably watched me. There was something unspeakably
pathetic in the spectacle of these poor fragments of wreckage, thus
laid out, and seeming, in the almost grotesque symmetry of their
disposal, to make a mute appeal for remembrance and justice. This was
all that was left of her; this and what was in the coffin.

So moved was I by the sight of these relics, thus assembled and
presented in a sort of tragic synopsis, that it was some time before I
could summon the resolution to look upon her very self, or at least
upon such vestiges of her as had survived the touch of “decay’s
effacing fingers.” But the time was passing, and it had to be. At last
I turned to the coffin, and, lifting the unfastened lid, looked in.

It could have been no different from what I had expected; but yet the
shock of its appearance seemed to strike me a palpable blow. Someone
had arranged the bones in their anatomical order; and there the
skeleton lay on the bottom of the coffin, dry, dusty, whitened with
the powder of lime, such a relic as might have been brought to light
by the spade of some excavator in an ancient barrow or prehistoric
tomb. And yet this thing was she--Angelina! That grisly skull had once
been clothed by her rich, abundant hair! That grinning range of long
white teeth had once sustained the sweet, pensive mouth that I
remembered so well. It was incredible. It was horrible. And yet it was
true.

For some moments I stood as if petrified, holding up the coffin lid
and gazing at the fearful shape in a trance of horror. And then
suddenly I felt, as it were, a clutching at my throat and the vision
faded into a blur as my eyes filled. Hastily I clapped down the coffin
lid and strode towards the door with the tears streaming down my face.

Vaguely I was aware of Bundy taking my arm and pressing it to his
side, of his voice as he murmured shakily, “Poor old John!” Passively
I allowed him to lead me to a quiet corner above a flight of steps
leading down to the river, where I halted to wipe my eyes, faintly
surprised to note that he was wiping his eyes too; and that his face
was pale and troubled. But if I was surprised, I was grateful, too;
and never had my heart inclined more affectionately towards him than
in this moment of trial that had been lightened by his unobtrusive
sympathy and perfect understanding.

We stayed for a few minutes, looking down on the river and talking of
the dead woman and the sad and troubled life from which this hideous
crime had snatched her; then, as the appointed time approached, we
made our way to the room in which the inquiry was to be held. As we
entered, a pleasant-looking, shrewd-faced man, who looked like a
barrister and who had been standing by a constable, approached and
accosted me.

“Dr. Strangeways? My name is Anstey. I do most of the court work in
connexion with Thorndyke’s cases, and I am representing him here
to-day. He had hoped to come down, himself, but he had to go into the
country on some important business, so I have to come to keep the nest
warm--to watch the proceedings and make a summary of the evidence. You
mentioned to him that the case would take more than one day.”

“Yes,” I answered, “that is what I understand. Will Dr. Thorndyke be
here to-morrow?”

“Yes; he has arranged definitely to attend to-morrow. And I think he
expects by then to have some information of importance to
communicate.”

“Indeed!” I said eagerly. “Do you happen to know the nature of it?”

Anstey laughed. “My dear Doctor,” said he, “you have met Thorndyke,
and you must know by now that he is about as communicative as a
Whitstable native. No one ever knows what cards he holds.”

“Yes,” I agreed, “he is extraordinarily secretive. Unnecessarily so,
it has seemed to me.”

Anstey shook his head. “He is perfectly right, Doctor. He knows his
own peculiar job to a finish. He is, in a way, like some
highly-specialized animal, such as the three-toed sloth, for instance;
which seems an abnormal sort of beast until you see it doing, with
unapproachable perfection, the thing that nature intended it to do.
Thorndyke is a case of perfect adaptation to a special environment.”

“Still,” I objected, “I don’t see the use of such extreme secrecy.”

“You would if you followed his cases. A secret move is a move against
which the other player--if there is one--can make no provision or
defence or counter-move. Thorndyke plays with a wooden face and
without speaking. No one knows what his next move will be. But when it
comes, he puts down his piece and says ‘check’; and you’ll find it is
mate.”

“But,” I still objected, “you are talking of an adversary and of
counter-moves. Is there any adversary in this case?”

“Well, isn’t there?” said he. “There has been a crime committed.
Someone has committed it; and that someone is not advertising his
identity. But you can take it that he has been keeping a watchful eye
on his pursuers, ready, if necessary, to give them a lead in the wrong
direction. But it is time for us to take our places. I see the jury
have come back from viewing the body.”

We took our places at the long table, one side of which was allocated
to the jury and the other to witnesses in waiting, the police
officers, the press-men, and other persons interested in the case. A
few minutes later, the coroner opened the proceedings by giving a very
brief statement of the circumstances which had occasioned the inquiry,
and then proceeded to call the witnesses.

The first witness was Sergeant Cobbledick, whose evidence took the
form of a statement covering the whole history of the case, beginning
with Mr. Japp’s notification of the disappearance of Mrs. Frood and
ending with the opening of the wall and the discovery of the remains.
The latter part of the evidence was given in minute detail and
included a complete list of the objects found with the remains.

“Does any juryman wish to ask the witness any questions?” the Coroner
inquired when the lengthy statement was concluded. He looked from one
to the other, and when nobody answered he called the next witness.
This was Dr. Baines, a somewhat dry-looking gentleman, who gave his
evidence clearly, concisely, and with due scientific caution.

“You have examined the remains which form the subject of this
inquiry?” the coroner asked.

“Yes. I have examined the skeleton which is now lying in the mortuary.
It is that of a rather strongly-built woman, five feet seven inches in
height, and about thirty years of age.”

“Were you able to form any opinion as to the cause of death?”

“No; there were no signs of any injury nor of disease.”

“Are we to understand,” asked one of the jurymen, “that you consider
deceased to have died a natural death?”

“I have no means of forming any opinion on the subject.”

“But if she died from violence, wouldn’t there be some signs of it?”

“That would depend on the nature of the violence.”

“Supposing she had been shot with a revolver?”

“In that case there might be a fracture of one or more bones, but
there might be no fracture at all. Of course, there would be a
bullet.”

“Did you find a bullet?”

“No. I did not see the bones until they had been brought to the
mortuary.”

“There has been no mention of a bullet having been found,” the coroner
interposed, “and you heard Sergeant Cobbledick say that the lime had
all been sifted through a fine sieve. We must take it that there was
no bullet. But,” he continued, addressing the witness, “the conditions
that you found would not exclude violence, I presume?”

“Not at all. Only violence that would cause injury to the bones.”

“What kinds of violence would be unaccompanied by injury to the
bones?”

“Drowning, hanging, strangling, suffocation, stabbing; and, of course,
poisoning usually leaves no traces on the bones.”

“Can you give us no suggestion as to the cause of death?”

“None whatever,” was the firm reply.

“You have heard the description of the missing woman, Mrs. Frood. Do
these remains correspond with that description?”

“They are the remains of a woman of similar stature and age to Mrs.
Frood, so far as I can judge. I can’t say more than that. The
description of Mrs. Frood was only approximate; and the estimate of
the stature, and especially the age, of a skeleton can only be
approximate.”

This being all that could be got out of the witness, who was concerned
only with the skeleton, and naturally refused to budge from that
position, the coroner glanced at his list and then called my name. I
rose and took my place at the top corner of the table, when I was duly
sworn, and gave my name and description.

“You heard Sergeant Cobbledick’s description of the articles which
have been found, and which are now lying in the mortuary?” the coroner
began.

I replied “Yes,” and he continued: “Have you examined those articles,
and, if so, can you tell us anything about them?”

“I have examined the articles in the mortuary, and I recognized them
as things I know to have been the property of Mrs. Angelina Frood.”

Here I described the articles in detail, and stated when and where I
had seen them in her possession.

“You have inspected the remains of deceased in the mortuary. Can you
identify them as the remains of any particular person?”

“No. They are quite unrecognizable.”

“Have you any doubt as to whose remains they are?” asked the juryman
who had spoken before.

“That question, Mr. Pilley,” said the coroner, “is not quite in order.
The witness has said that he was not able to identify the remains.
Inferences as to the identity of deceased, drawn from the evidence,
are for the jury. We must not ask witnesses to interpret the evidence.
When did you last see Mrs. Frood alive, Doctor?”

“On the 26th of April,” I replied; and here I described that last
interview, recalling our conversation almost verbatim. When I came to
her expressions of uneasiness and foreboding, the attention of the
listeners became more and more intense, and it was evident that they
were deeply impressed. Particularly attentive was the foreman of the
jury, a keen-faced, alert-looking man, who kept his eyes riveted on
me, and, when I had finished this part of my evidence, asked: “So far
as you know, Doctor, had Mrs. Frood any enemies? Was there anyone whom
she had reason to be afraid of?”

This was a rather awkward question. It is one thing to entertain a
suspicion privately, but quite another thing to give public expression
to it. Besides, I was giving sworn evidence as to facts actually
within my knowledge.

“I can’t say, positively,” I replied after some hesitation, “that I
know of any enemy or anyone whom she had reason to fear.”

The coroner saw the difficulty, and interposed with a discreet
question.

“What do you know of her domestic affairs, of her relations with her
husband, for instance?”

This put the matter on the basis of fact, and I was able to state what
I knew of her unhappy married life in Rochester and previously in
London; and further questions elicited my personal observations as to
the character and personality of her husband. My meeting with him at
Dartford Station, the incidents in the Poor Travellers’ rest-house,
the meeting with him on the bridge; all were given in full detail and
devoured eagerly by the jury. And from their questions and their
demeanour it became clear to me that they were in full cry after
Nicholas Frood.

The conclusion of my evidence brought us to the luncheon hour. I had,
of course, to take Mr. Anstey back to lunch with me, and a certain
wistfulness in Bundy’s face made me feel that I ought to ask him, too.
I accordingly presented them to one another and issued the invitation.

“I am delighted to meet you, Mr. Bundy,” Anstey said heartily. “I have
heard of you from my friend Thorndyke, who regards you with respectful
admiration.”

“Does he?” said Bundy, blushing with pleasure, but looking somewhat
surprised. “I can’t imagine why. But are you an expert, too?”

“Bless you, no,” laughed Anstey. “I am a mere lawyer, and, on this
occasion, what is known technically as a devil--technically, you
understand. I am watching this case for Thorndyke.”

“But I didn’t know that Dr. Thorndyke was interested in the case,”
said Bundy, in evident perplexity.

“He is interested in everything of a criminal and horrid nature,”
replied Anstey. “He never lets a really juicy crime mystery pass
without getting all the details, if possible. You see, they are his
stock in trade.”

“But he never would discuss this case--not seriously,” objected Bundy.

“Probably not,” said Anstey. “Perhaps there wasn’t much to discuss.
But wait till the case is finished. Then he will tell you all about
it.”

“I see,” said Bundy. “He is one of those prophets who predict after
the event.”

“And the proper time, too,” retorted Anstey. “It is no use being
premature.”

The conversation proceeded on this plane of playful repartee until we
arrived at my house, where Mrs. Dunk, having bestowed a wooden glance
of curiosity at Anstey and a glare of defiance at Bundy, handed me a
telegram addressed to R. Anstey, K.C., care of Dr. Strangeways. I
passed it to Anstey, who opened it and glanced through it.

“What shall I say in answer?” he asked, placing it in my hand.

I read the message and was not a little puzzled by it. “Ask
Strangeways come back with you to-night. Very urgent. Reply time and
place.”

“What do you suppose he wants me for?” I asked.

“I never suppose in regard to Thorndyke,” he replied. “But if he says
it is urgent, it is urgent. Can you come up with me?”

“Yes, if it is necessary.”

“It is. Then I’ll say yes. And you had better arrange to stay the
night--there is a spare bedroom at his chambers--and come down with
him in the morning. Can you manage that?”

“Yes,” I replied; “and you can say that we shall be at Charing Cross
by seven-fifteen.”

I could see that this transaction was as surprising to Bundy as it was
to me. But, of course, he asked no questions, nor could I have
answered them if he had. Moreover, there was not much time for
discussion as we had to be back in the court room by two o’clock, and
what talk there was consisted mainly of humorous comments by Anstey on
the witnesses and the jury.

Having sent off the telegram on our way down, we took our places once
more, and the proceedings were resumed punctually by the calling of
the foreman of the repairing gang; who deposed to the date on which
the particular patch of rubble was commenced and finished and its
condition when the men knocked off work on Saturday, the 26th of
April. He also mentioned the loss of the key, but could give no
particulars. The cross-examination elicited the facts that he had
communicated to Cobbledick and me as to the state of the loose
filling.

“How many men,” the coroner asked, “would it have taken to bury the
body in the way in which it was buried; and how long?”

“One man could have done it easily in one night, if he could have got
the body there. The stuff in the wall was all loose, and it was small
stuff, easy to handle. No building had to be done. It was just a
matter of shovelling the lime in and then chucking the loose stuff in
on top. And the lime was handy to get at in the shed, and one of the
barrels was open.”

“Can you say certainly when the body was buried?”

“It must have been buried on the night of the 26th of April or on the
27th, because on Monday morning, the 28th, we ran the mortar in, and
by that evening we had got the patch finished.”

The next witness was the labourer, Thomas Evans, who had lost the key.
His account of the affair was as follows:

“On the morning of Saturday, the 26th of April, the foreman gave me
the key, because he had to go to the office. I took the key and opened
the gate, and I left the key in the lock for him to take when he came.
Then I forgot all about it, and I suppose he did, too, because he
didn’t say anything about it until we had knocked off work and were
going out. Then he asks me where the key was, and I said it was in the
gate. Then he went and looked but it wasn’t there. So we searched
about a bit in the grounds and out in the lane; but we couldn’t see
nothing of it nowhere.”

“When you let yourself in, did you leave the gate open or shut it?”

“I shut the gate, but, of course, it was unlocked. The key was
outside.”

“So that anyone passing up the lane could have taken it out without
your noticing?”

“Yes. We was working the other side of the grounds, so we shouldn’t
have heard anything if anybody had took it.”

That completed the evidence as to the key, and when Evans was
dismissed the matron of the Poor Travellers was called. As she took
her place, a general straightening of backs and air of expectancy on
the part of the jury suggested that her evidence was looked forward to
with more than common interest. And so it turned out to be. Her
admirably clear and vivid presentment of the man, Nicholas Frood; his
quarrelsome, emotional temperament, his shabby condition, his abnormal
appearance, the evidences of his addiction to drink and drugs, his
apparently destitute state, and, above all, the formidable
sheath-knife that he wore under his coat; were listened to with
breathless attention, and followed by a fusilade of eager, and often
highly improper, questions. But the coroner was a wise and tactful
man, and he unobtrusively intervened to prevent any irregularities;
as, for instance, “It is not permissible,” he observed, blandly, “to
ask a witness if a certain individual seemed to be a likely person to
commit a crime. And a coroner’s court is not a criminal court. It is
not our function to establish any person’s guilt, but to ascertain how
deceased met with her death. If the evidence shows that she was
murdered, we shall say so in our verdict. If the evidence points
clearly to a particular person as the murderer, we shall name that
person in the verdict. But we are not primarily investigating a crime;
we are investigating a death. The criminal investigation is for the
police.”

This reminder cooled the ardour of the criminal investigators
somewhat, but there were signs of a fresh outbreak when Mrs. Gillow
gave her evidence, for that lady having a somewhat more lively
imagination than the matron, tended to lure enterprising jurymen on to
fresh indiscretions. She certainly enjoyed herself amazingly, and
occupied a most unnecessary amount of time before she at length
retired, dejected but triumphant, to the manifest relief of the
coroner.

This brought the day’s proceedings to a close. There were a few more
witnesses on the list, and the coroner hoped to take their evidence
and complete the inquiry on the following day. As soon as the court
rose, Anstey and I with Bundy proceeded to a tea-shop hard by and,
having refreshed ourselves with a light tea, set forth to catch our
train at Strood Station. Thither Bundy accompanied us at my
invitation, but though I suspected that he was bursting with curiosity
as to the object of my mysterious journey, he made no reference to it,
nor did I or Anstey.

At the barrier at Charing Cross we found Thorndyke awaiting us, and
Anstey, having delivered me into his custody and seen us into a
taxi-cab that had already been chartered, wished us success and took
his leave. Then the driver, who apparently had his instructions,
started and moved out of the station.

“I don’t know,” said I, “whether I may now ask what I am wanted for.”

“I should rather not go into particulars,” he replied. “I want your
opinion on something that I am going to show you, and I especially
want it to be an impromptu opinion. Previous consideration might
create a bias which would detract from the conclusiveness of your
decision. However, you have only a few minutes to wait.”

In those few minutes I could not refrain from cudgelling my brains,
even at the risk of creating a bias, and was still doing so--quite
unproductively--when the cab approached the hospital of St. Barnabas
and gave me a hint. But it swept past the main entrance, and, turning
up a side street, slowed down and stopped opposite the entrance of the
medical school. Here we got out, and, leaving the cab waiting, entered
the hall, where Thorndyke inquired for a person of the name of Farrow.
In a minute or two this individual made his appearance in the form of
a somewhat frowsy, elderly man, whom, from the multitude of warts on
his hands, I inferred to be the post-mortem porter or dissecting-room
attendant. He appeared to be a taciturn man, and he, too, evidently
had his instructions, for he merely looked at us and then walked away
slowly, leaving us to follow. Thus silently he conducted us down a
long corridor, across a quadrangle beyond which rose the conical roof
of a theatre, along a curved passage which followed the wall of the
circular building and down a flight of stone steps which let into a
dim, cement-floored basement, lighted by sparse electric bulbs and
pervaded by a faint, distinctive odour that memory associated with the
science of anatomy. From the main basement room Farrow turned into a
short passage, where he stopped at a door, and, having unlocked it,
threw it open and switched on the light, when we entered and I looked
around. It was a large, cellar-like room, lighted by a single powerful
electric bulb fitted with a basin-like metal reflector and attached to
a long, movable arm. The activities usually carried on in it were
evident from the great tins of red lead on the shelves, from a large
brass syringe fitted with a stop-cock and smeared with red paint, and
from a range of oblong slate tanks or coffers furnished with massive
wooden lids.

Still without uttering a word, the taciturn Farrow swung the powerful
lamp over one of the coffers, and then drew off the lid. I stepped
forward and looked in. The coffer was occupied by the body of a man,
evidently--from the shaven head and the traces of red paint--prepared
as an anatomical “subject.” I looked at it curiously, thinking how
unhuman, how artificial it seemed; how like to a somewhat dingy
waxwork figure. But as I looked I was dimly conscious of some sense of
familiarity stealing into my mind. Some chord of memory seemed to be
touched. I stooped and looked more closely; and then, suddenly, I
started up.

“Good God!” I exclaimed. “It is Nicholas Frood!”

“Are you sure?” asked Thorndyke.

“Yes, quite,” I answered. “It was the shaved head that put me off: the
absence of that mop of hair. I have no doubt at all. Still--let us
have a look at the hands.”

Farrow lifted up the hands one after the other; and then, if there
could have been any doubt, it was set at rest. The mahogany-coloured
stain was still visible; but much more conclusive were the bulbous
finger-tips and the mis-shapen, nutshell-like nails. There could be no
possible doubt.

“This is certainly the man I saw at Rochester,” said I. “I am fully
prepared to swear to that. But oughtn’t he to have been identified by
somebody who knew him better?”

“The body has been identified this afternoon by his late landlady,”
replied Thorndyke, “but I wanted your confirmation, and I wanted you
as a witness at the inquest. The identification is important in
relation to the inquiry and the possible verdict.”

“Yes, by Jove!” I agreed, with a vivid recollection of the questions
put to Mrs. Gillow. “This will come as a thunder-bolt to the jury. But
how, in the name of Fortune, did he come here?”

“I’ll tell you about that presently,” replied Thorndyke. He tendered a
fee to the exhibitor, and when the latter had replaced the lid of the
coffer, he conducted us back to our starting-point, and saw us into
the waiting cab.

“5a, King’s Bench Walk,” Thorndyke instructed the driver, and as the
cab started, he began his explanation.

“This has been a long and weary search, with a stroke of unexpected
good luck at the end. We have had to go through endless records of
hospitals, police-courts, poor-houses, infirmaries, and inquests. It
was the records of an inquest that put us at last on the track; an
inquest on an unknown man, supposed to be a tramp. Roughly, the
history of the affair is this:

“Frood seems to have started for Brighton on the 25th of April, but
for some unexplained reason, he broke his journey and got out at
Horwell. What happened to him there is not clear. He may have
over-dosed himself with cocaine; but at any rate, he was found dead in
a meadow, close to a hedge, on the morning of the 26th. He was
therefore dead before his wife disappeared. The body was taken to the
mortuary and there carefully examined. But there was not the faintest
clue to his identity. His pockets were searched, but there was not a
vestige of property of any kind about him, not even the knife of which
you have spoken. The probability is that he had been robbed by some
tramp of everything that he had about him, either while he was
insensible or after he was dead. In any case he appeared to be
completely destitute, and this fact, together with his decidedly dirty
and neglected condition, led naturally to the conclusion that he was a
tramp. An inquest was held, but of course, no expensive and
troublesome measures were taken to trace his identity. Examinations
showed that he had not died from the effects of violence, so it was
assumed that he had died from exposure, and a verdict to that effect
was returned. He was about to be given a pauper’s funeral when
Providence intervened on our behalf. It happened that the Demonstrator
of Anatomy at St. Barnabas resides at Horwell; and it happened that
the presence of an unclaimed body in the mortuary came to his
knowledge. Thereupon he applied to the authorities, on behalf of his
school, for the use of it as an anatomical subject. His application
was granted and the body was conveyed to St. Barnabas, where it was at
once embalmed and prepared and then put aside for use during the next
winter session.”

“Was that quite in order--legally, I mean?”

“That is not for us to ask,” he replied. “It was not in any way
contrary to public policy, and it has been our salvation in respect of
our particular inquiry.”

“I suppose it has,” I said, not, however, quite seeing it in that
light. “Of course, it disposes of the question of his guilt.”

“It does a good deal more than that as matters have turned out,” said
he. “However, here we are in the precincts of the Temple. Let us
dismiss Nicholas Frood from our minds for the time being, and turn our
attention to the more attractive subject of dinner.”

The cab stopped opposite a tall house with a fine carved-brick
portico, and, when Thorndyke had paid the driver, we ascended the
steps and made our way up a couple of flights of oaken stairs to the
first floor. Here, at the door of my friend’s chambers, we encountered
a small, clerical-looking gentleman with an extremely wrinkly, smiling
face, who reminded me somewhat of Mr. Japp.

“This is Mr. Polton, Strangeways,” said Thorndyke, presenting him to
me, “who relieves me of all the physical labour of laboratory work. He
is a specialist in everything, including cookery, and if my nose does
not mislead me--ha! Does it, Polton?”

“That depends, sir, on which way you follow it,” replied Polton, with
a smile of labyrinthine wrinkliness. “But you will want to wash, and
Dr. Strangeways’s room is ready for him.”

On this hint, Thorndyke conducted me to an upper floor, and to a
pleasant bedroom with an outlook on plane trees and ancient, red-tiled
roofs, where I washed and brushed up, and from whence I presently
descended to the sitting-room, whither Thorndyke’s nose had already
led him--and to good purpose, too.

“Mr. Polton has missed his vocation,” I remarked, as I attacked his
productions with appreciative gusto. “He ought to have been the
manager of a West End club or a high-class restaurant.”

Thorndyke regarded me severely. “I am shocked at you, Strangeways,” he
said. “Do you suggest that a man who can make anything from an
astronomical clock to a microscope objective, who is an expert in
every branch of photographic technique, a fair analytical chemist, a
microscopist, and general handicraftsman, should be degraded to the
office of a mere superintendent cook? It is a dreadful thought!”

“I didn’t understand that he was a man of so many talents and
accomplishments,” I said apologetically.

“He is a most remarkable man,” said Thorndyke, “and I take it as a
great condescension that he is willing to prepare my meals. It is his
own choice--an expression of personal devotion. He doesn’t like me to
take my food at restaurants or clubs. And, of course, he does it well
because he is incapable of doing anything otherwise than well. You
must come up and see the laboratories and workshop after dinner.”

We went up when we had finished our meal and discovered Polton in the
act of cutting transverse sections of hairs and mounting them to add
to the great collection of microscopic objects that Thorndyke had
accumulated. He left this occupation to show me the great standing
camera for copying, enlarging, reducing and microphotography, to
demonstrate the capabilities of a fine back-geared lathe and to
exhibit the elaborate outfit for analysis and assay work.

“I had no idea,” said I, as we returned to the sitting-room, “that
medico-legal practice involved the use of all these complicated
appliances.”

“The truth is,” Thorndyke replied, “that Medical Jurisprudence is not
a single subject, concerned with one order of knowledge. It represents
the application of every kind of knowledge to the solution of an
infinite variety of legal problems. And that reminds me that I haven’t
yet looked through Anstey’s abstract of the evidence at the inquest,
which I saw that he had left for me. Shall we go through it now? It
won’t take us very long. Then we can have a stroll round the Temple or
on the Embankment before we turn in.”

“You are coming down to Rochester to-morrow?” I asked.

“Yes,” he replied. “The facts concerning Nicholas Frood will have to
be communicated to the coroner; and it is possible that some other
points may arise.”

“Now that Frood is definitely out of the picture,” said I, “do you see
any possibility of solving the mystery of this crime? I mean as to the
identity of the guilty parties?”

He reflected awhile. “I am inclined to think,” he replied, at length,
“that I may be able to offer a suggestion. But, of course, I have not
yet seen the remains.”

“There isn’t much to be gleaned from them, I am afraid,” said I.

“Perhaps not,” he answered. “But we shall be able to judge better when
we have read the evidence of the medical witness.”

“He wasn’t able to offer any opinion as to the cause of death,” I
said.

“Then,” he replied, “we may take it that there are no obvious signs.
However, it is useless to speculate. We must suspend our judgment
until to-morrow”; and with this he opened Anstey’s summary, and read
through it rapidly, asking me a question now and again to amplify some
point. When he had finished the abstract--which appeared to be very
brief and condensed--he put it in his pocket and suggested that we
should start for our proposed walk; and, though I made one or two
attempts to reopen the subject of the inquiry, he was not to be drawn
into any further statements. Apparently there was some point that he
hoped to clear up by personal observation, and meanwhile he held his
judgment in suspense.




 CHAPTER XVII.
 THORNDYKE PUTS DOWN HIS PIECE

The journey down to Rochester would have been more agreeable and
interesting under different circumstances. Thorndyke kept up a flow of
lively conversation to which I should ordinarily have listened with
the keenest pleasure. But he persistently avoided any reference to the
object of our journey; and as this was the subject that engrossed my
thoughts and from which I was unable to detach them, his
conversational efforts were expended on somewhat inattentive ears. In
common politeness I tried to make a show of listening and even of some
sort of response; but the instant a pause occurred, my thoughts flew
back to the engrossing subject and the round of fruitless speculation
begun again.

What was it that Thorndyke had in his mind? He was not making this
journey to inform the coroner of Frood’s death. That could have been
done by letter; and, moreover, I was the actual witness to the dead
man’s identity. There was some point that he expected to be able to
elucidate; some evidence that had been overlooked. And that evidence
seemed to be connected with that dreadful, pitiful thing that lay in
the coffin--crying out, indeed, to Heaven for retribution, but crying
in a voice all inarticulate. But would it be inarticulate to him? He
had seemed to imply an expectation of being able to infer from the
appearance of those mouldering bones the cause and manner of death,
and even--so it had appeared to me--the very identity of the murderer.
But how could this be possible? Dr. Baines had said that the bones
showed no signs of injury. The soft structures of the body had
disappeared utterly. What suggestion as to the cause of death could
the bones offer? Chronic mineral poisoning might be ascertainable from
examination of the skeleton, but not from a mere ocular inspection;
and the question of chronic poisoning did not arise. Angelina was
alive on the Saturday evening; before the Monday morning her body was
in the wall. Again and again I dismissed the problem as an
impenetrable mystery; and still it presented itself afresh for
consideration.

A few words of explanation to the constable on duty at the mortuary
secured our admission, or, rather Thorndyke’s; for I did not go in,
but stood in the doorway, watching him inquisitively. He looked over
the objects set out on the tray and seemed to be mentally checking
them. Then he put on a pair of pince-nez and examined some of them
more closely. From the tray he presently turned to the coffin, and,
lifting off the lid, stood for a while, with his pince-nez in his
hand, looking intently at the awful relics of the dead woman. From his
face I could gather nothing. It was at all times a rather immobile
face, in accordance with his calm, even temperament. Now it expressed
nothing but interest and close attention. He inspected the whole
skeleton methodically, as I could see by the way his eyes travelled
slowly from the head to the foot of the coffin. Then, once more, he
put on his reading-glasses, and stooped to examine more closely
something in the upper part of the coffin--I judged it to be the
skull. At length he stood up, put away his glasses, replaced the
coffin-lid, and rejoined me.

“Has the sitting of the Court begun yet?” he asked the constable.

“They began about five minutes ago, sir,” was the reply; on which we
made our way to the court-room, where Thorndyke, having secured a
place at the table, beckoned to the coroner’s officer.

“Will you hand that to the coroner, please?” said he, producing from
his pocket a note in an official-looking blue envelope. The officer
took the note and laid it down before the coroner, who glanced at it
and nodded and then looked with sudden interest at Thorndyke. The
witness who was being examined at the moment was the pawnbroker’s
daughter, and her account of the mysterious man with the mole on his
nose was engaging the attention of the jury. While the examination was
proceeding, the coroner glanced from time to time at the note.
Presently he took it up and opened the envelope, and in a pause in the
evidence, took out the note and turned it over to look at the
signature. Then he ran his eyes over the contents, and I saw his
eyebrows go up. But at that moment one of the jurymen asked a
question, and the note was laid down while the answer was entered in
the depositions. At length the evidence of this witness was completed,
and the witness dismissed, when the coroner took up the note and read
it through carefully.

“Before we take the evidence of Israel Bangs, gentlemen,” said he, “we
had better consider some new facts which I think you will regard as
highly important. I have just received a communication from Dr. John
Thorndyke, who is a very eminent authority on medico-legal evidence.
He informs me that the husband of the deceased, Nicholas Frood, is
dead. It appears that he died about three months ago, but his body was
not identified until yesterday, when it was seen by Frood’s landlady
and by Dr. Strangeways, who is here and can give evidence as to the
identity. I propose that we first recall Dr. Strangeways and then ask
Dr. Thorndyke, who is also present, to give us the further
particulars.”

The jury agreed warmly to the suggestion, and I was at once recalled,
and as I took my place at the coroner’s left hand I felt that I was
fully justifying Cobbledick’s description of me as the “star witness,”
for not only was I the object of eager interest on the part of the
jury and the sergeant himself, but also of Bundy, whose eyes were
riveted on me with devouring curiosity.

There is no need for me to repeat my evidence. It was quite short. I
just briefly described the body and its situation. As to how it came
to the hospital, I had no personal knowledge, but I affirmed that it
was undoubtedly the body of Nicholas Frood. Of that I was quite
certain.

No questions were asked. There was a good deal of whispered comment,
and one indiscreet juryman remarked audibly that “this fellow seemed
to have cheated the hangman.” Then the coroner deferentially requested
Thorndyke to give the Court any information that was available, and my
friend advanced to the head of the table, where the coroner’s officer
placed a chair for him, and took the oath.

“What a perfectly awful thing this is about poor old Nicholas!”
whispered Bundy, who had crept into the chair that Thorndyke had just
vacated. “It makes one’s flesh creep to think of it.”

“It _was_ rather horrible,” I agreed, noting that my description of
the scene had evidently made _his_ flesh creep, for he was as pale as
a ghost. But there was no time to discuss the matter further, for
Thorndyke, having been sworn, and started by a general question from
the coroner, now began to give his evidence, in the form of a
narrative similar to that which I had heard from him, and accompanied
by the production of documents relating to the inquest and the
transfer of the body of the unknown deceased to the medical school.

“There is no doubt, I suppose, as to the date of this man’s death?”
the coroner asked.

“Practically none. He was seen alive on the 25th of April, and he was
found dead on the morning of the 26th. I have put in a copy of the
depositions at the inquest, which give the date and time of the
finding of the body.”

“Then, as his death occurred before the disappearance of his wife,
this inquiry is not concerned with him any further.”

Here the foreman of the jury interposed with a question. “It seems
that Dr. Thorndyke took a great deal of trouble to trace this man,
Frood. Was he acting for the police?”

“I don’t know that that is strictly our concern,” said the coroner,
looking at Thorndyke, nevertheless, with a somewhat inquiring
expression.

“I was acting,” said Thorndyke, “in pursuance of instructions from a
private client to investigate the circumstances of Mrs. Frood’s
disappearance, to ascertain whether a crime had been committed and, if
so, to endeavour to find the guilty party or parties.”

“He never told us that,” murmured Bundy; “at least--did you know,
John?”

“I did, as a matter of fact, but I was sworn to secrecy.”

Bundy looked at me a little reproachfully, I thought, and I caught a
queer glance from Cobbledick. But just then the coroner spoke again.

“Have you seen the evidence that was given yesterday?”

“Yes, I have a summary of it, which I have read.”

“Can you, from your investigations, tell us anything that was not
disclosed by that evidence?”

“Yes. I have just examined the remains of the deceased and the
articles which have been found from time to time. I think I can give
some additional information concerning them.”

“From your examination of the remains,” the coroner said somewhat
eagerly, “can you give any opinion as to the cause of death?”

“No,” replied Thorndyke. “My examination had reference chiefly to the
identity of the remains.”

The coroner looked disappointed. “The identity of the remains,” said
he, “is not in question. They have been clearly identified as those of
Angelina Frood.”

“Then,” said Thorndyke, “they have been wrongly identified. I can
swear positively that they are not the remains of Angelina Frood.”

At this statement a sudden hush fell on the Court, broken
incongruously by an audible whistle from Sergeant Cobbledick. On me
the declaration fell like a thunder-bolt, and, on looking round at
Bundy, I could see that he was petrified with astonishment. There was
a silence of some seconds’ duration. Then the coroner said, with a
distinctly puzzled air: “This is a very remarkable statement, Dr.
Thorndyke. It seems to be quite at variance with all the facts: and it
appears almost incredible that you should be able to speak with such
certainty, having regard to the condition of the remains and in spite
of the extraordinary effect of the lime.”

“It is on account of the effect of the lime that I am able to speak
with so much certainty and confidence,” Thorndyke replied.

“I don’t quite follow that,” said the coroner. “Would you kindly tell
us how you were able to determine that these remains are not those of
Angelina Frood?”

“It is a matter of simple inference,” replied Thorndyke. “On the 26th
of April last Mrs. Frood is known to have been alive. It has been
assumed that on that night or the next her body was built up in the
wall. If that had really happened, when the wall was opened on the
20th of July, the body would have been found intact and perfectly
recognizable!”

“You are not overlooking the circumstance that it was buried in a bed
of quick-lime?” said the coroner.

“No,” replied Thorndyke; “in fact that is the circumstance that makes
it quite certain that these remains are not those of Angelina Frood.
There is,” he continued, “a widely prevalent belief that quick-lime
has the property of completely consuming and destroying organic
substances such as a dead human body. But that belief is quite
erroneous. Quick-lime has no such properties. On the contrary, it has
a strongly preservative effect on organic matter. Putrefaction is a
change in organic matter which occurs only when that matter is more or
less moist. If such matter is completely dried, putrefaction is
prevented or arrested, and such dried, or mummified, matter will
remain undecomposed almost indefinitely, as we see in the case of
Egyptian mummies. But quick-lime has the property of abstracting the
water from organic substances with which it is in contact; of
rendering them completely dry. It thus acts as a very efficient
preservative. If Mrs. Frood’s body had been buried, when recently
dead, three months ago in fresh quick-lime, it would by now have been
reduced more or less to the condition of a mummy. It would not have
been even partially destroyed, and it would have been easily
recognizable.”

To this statement everyone present listened with profound attention
and equally profound surprise; and a glance at the faces of the
jurymen was sufficient to show that it had failed utterly to produce
conviction. Even the coroner was evidently not satisfied, and, after a
few moments’ reflection with knitted brows, he stated his objection.

“The belief in the destructive properties of lime,” he said, “can
hardly be accepted as a mere popular error. In the Crippen trial, you
may remember that the question was raised, and one of the expert
witnesses--no less an authority than Professor Pepper--gave it as his
considered opinion that quick-lime has these destructive properties,
and that if a body were buried in a sufficient quantity of quick-lime,
that body would be entirely destroyed. You will agree, I think, that
great weight attaches to the opinion of a man of Professor Pepper’s
great reputation.”

“Undoubtedly,” Thorndyke agreed. “He was one of our greatest
medico-legal authorities, though, on this subject, I think, his views
differed from those generally held by medical jurists. But the point
is that this was an opinion, and that no undeniable facts were then
available. But since that time, the matter has been put to the test of
actual experiment, and the results of those experiments are definite
facts. It is no longer a matter of opinion but one of incontestable
fact.”

“What are the experiments that you refer to?”

“The first practical investigation was carried out by Mr. A. Lucas,
the Director of the Government Analytical Laboratory and Assay Office
at Cairo. He felt that the question was one of great medico-legal
importance, and that it ought to be settled definitely. He accordingly
carried out a number of experiments, of which he published the
particulars in his treatise on ‘Forensic Chemistry.’ I produce a copy
of this book, with your permission.”

“Is this evidence admissible?” the foreman asked. “The witness can’t
swear to another man’s experiments.”

“It is admissible in a coroner’s court,” was the reply. “We are not
bound as rigidly by the rules of evidence as a criminal court, for
instance. It is relevant to the inquiry, and I think we had better
hear it.”

“I may say,” said Thorndyke, “that I have repeated and confirmed these
experiments; but I suggest that, as the published cases are the
recognized authority, I be allowed to quote them before describing my
confirmatory experiments.”

The coroner having agreed to this course, he continued: “The tests
were made with the fresh bodies of young pigeons, which were plucked
but not opened, and which were buried in boxes with loosely-fitted
covers, filled respectively with dry earth, slaked lime, chlorinated
lime, quick-lime, and quick-lime suddenly slaked with water. These
bodies were left thus buried for six months, the boxes being placed on
the laboratory roof at Cairo. At the end of that period the bodies
were disinterred and examined with the following results: The body
which had been buried in dry earth was found to be in a very bad
condition. There was a considerable smell of putrefaction and a large
part of the flesh had disappeared. The body which had been buried in
quick-lime was found to be in good condition; it was dry and hard, the
skin was unbroken, but the body was naturally shrunken. The other
three bodies do not concern us, but I may say that none of them was as
completely preserved as the one that was buried in quick-lime.

“On reading the account of these experiments I decided to repeat them,
partly for confirmation and partly to enable me to give direct
evidence as to the effect of lime on dead bodies. I used
freshly-killed rabbits from which the fur was removed by shaving, and
buried them in roomy boxes in the same materials as were used in the
published experiments. They were left undisturbed during the six
summer months, and were then exhumed and examined. The rabbit which
had been buried in dry earth was in an advanced stage of putrefaction;
the one which had been buried in quick-lime was free from any odour of
decomposition, the skin was intact, and the body unaltered excepting
that it was dry and rather shrivelled--mummified, in fact. It was more
completely preserved than any of the others.”

The conclusion of this statement was followed by a slightly
uncomfortable silence. The coroner stroked his chin reflectively, and
the jurymen looked at one another with obvious doubt and distrust. At
length Mr. Pilley gave voice to the collective sentiments.

“It’s all very well, sir, for this learned gentleman to explain to us
that the lime couldn’t have eaten up the body of the deceased. But it
has. We’ve seen the bare bones with our own eyes. What’s the use of
saying a thing is impossible when it has happened?”

Here Thorndyke produced from his pocket a sheet of notepaper and a
fountain pen, and began to write rapidly, noting down, as I supposed,
the jurymen’s objections; which, however, the coroner proceeded to
answer.

“Dr. Thorndyke’s statement was that these bones are not the bones of
Angelina Frood. That the body was not her body.”

“Still,” said the foreman, “it was somebody’s body, you know. And the
lime seems to have eaten it up pretty clean, possible or impossible.”

“Exactly,” said the coroner. “The destruction of this particular body
appears to be an undeniable fact; and we may assume that one body is
very much like another--in a chemical sense, at least. What do you
say, Doctor?”

“My statement,” replied Thorndyke, “had reference to Angelina Frood,
who is known to have been alive on a certain date. Of the condition of
the unknown body that was buried in the wall, I can give no opinion.”

Again there was an uncomfortable silence, during which Thorndyke,
having finished writing, folded the sheet of notepaper, tucked the end
in securely, and wrote an address on the back. Then he handed it to
his neighbour, who passed it on until it reached me. I was on the
point of opening it when I observed with astonishment that it was
addressed to Peter Bundy, Esq., to whom I immediately handed it. But
my astonishment was nothing to Bundy’s. He seemed positively
thunderstruck. Indeed, his aspect was so extraordinary as he sat
gazing wildly at the opened note, that I forgot my manners and frankly
stared at him. First he turned scarlet; then he grew deathly pale; and
then he turned scarlet again. And, for the first and only time in my
life, I saw him look really angry. But this was only a passing
manifestation. For a few moments his eyes flashed and his mouth set
hard. Then, quite suddenly, the wrath faded from his face and gave
place to a whimsical smile. He tore off the fly-leaf of the note, and,
scribbling a few words on it, folded it up small, addressed it to Dr.
Thorndyke, and handed it to me for transmission by the return route.

When it reached Thorndyke, he opened it, and, having read the brief
message, nodded gravely to Bundy, and once more turned his attention
to the foreman, who was addressing the coroner at greater length.

“The jury wish to say, sir, that this evidence is not satisfactory. It
can’t be reconciled with the other evidence. The facts before the jury
are these: On the 26th of April Angelina Frood disappeared, and was
never afterwards seen alive. On the night that she disappeared, or on
the next night, a dead body was buried in the wall. Three months later
that body was found in the wall, packed in quick-lime, and eaten away
to a skeleton. That skeleton has been examined by an expert, and found
to be that of a woman of similar size and age to Angelina Frood. With
that skeleton were found articles of clothing, jewellery, and
ornaments which have been proved to have been the clothing and
property of Angelina Frood. Other articles of clothing have been
recovered from the river; and those articles were missing from the
body when it was found in the wall. On these facts, the jury feel that
it is impossible to doubt that the remains found in the wall are the
remains of Angelina Frood.”

As the foreman concluded the coroner turned to Thorndyke with a
slightly puzzled smile. “Of course, Doctor,” said he, “you have
considered those facts that the foreman has summarized so admirably.
What do you say to his conclusion?”

“I must still contest it,” replied Thorndyke. “The foreman’s summary
of the evidence, masterly as it was, furnishes no answer to the
objection--based on established chemical facts--that the condition of
the remains when found is irreconcilable with the alleged
circumstances of the burial.”

The coroner raised his eyebrows and pursed up his lips. “I appreciate
your point, Doctor,” said he. “But we are on the horns of a dilemma.
We are between the Devil of observed fact and the Deep Sea of
scientific demonstration. Can you suggest any way out of the
difficulty?”

“I think,” said Thorndyke, “that if you were to call Mr. Bundy, he
might be able to help you out of your dilemma.”

“Mr. Bundy!” exclaimed the coroner. “I didn’t know he was concerned in
the case. Can you give us any information, Mr. Bundy?”

“Yes,” replied Bundy, looking somewhat shy and nervous. “I think I
could throw a little light on the case.”

“I wish to goodness you had said so before. However, better late than
never. We will take your evidence at once.”

On this Thorndyke returned to his seat at the table and Bundy took his
place, standing by the chair which Thorndyke had resigned.

“Let me see, Mr. Bundy,” said the coroner, “your Christian name
is----”

“The witness has not been sworn,” interrupted Thorndyke.

The coroner smiled. “We are in the hands of the regular
practitioners,” he chuckled. “We must mind our p’s and q’s. Still you
are quite right, Doctor. The name is part of the evidence.”

The witness was accordingly sworn, and the coroner then proceeded,
smilingly: “Now, Mr. Bundy, be very careful. You are making a sworn
statement, remember. What is your Christian name?”

“Angelina,” was the astounding reply.

“Angelina!” bawled Pilley. “It can’t be. Why, it’s a woman’s name.”

“We must presume that the witness knows his own name,” said the
coroner, writing it down. “Angelina Bundy.”

“No, Sir,” said the witness. “Angelina Frood.”

The coroner suddenly stiffened with the upraised pen poised in the
air; and so everyone in the room, including myself, underwent an
instantaneous arrest of movement as if we had been turned into stone;
and I noticed that the process of petrifaction had caught us all with
our mouths open. But whereas the fixed faces on which I looked,
expressed amazement qualified by incredulity, my own astonishment was
coupled with conviction. Astounding as the statement was, the moment
that it was made I knew that it was true. In spite of the
discrepancies of appearance, I realized in a flash of enlightenment,
the nature of that subtle influence that had drawn me to Bundy with a
tenderness hardly congruous with mere male friendship. Outwardly I had
been deceived, but my sub-conscious self had recognized Angelina all
the time.

The interval of breathless silence, during which the witness calmly
surveyed the court through his--or rather her--eyeglass, was at length
broken by the coroner, who asked gravely: “This is not a joke? You
affirm seriously that you are Angelina Frood?”

“Yes; I am Angelina Frood,” was the reply.

Here Mr. Pilley recovered himself and demanded excitedly: “Do we
understand this gentleman to say that he is the deceased?”

“Well,” replied the coroner, “he is obviously not deceased, and he
states that he is not a gentleman. He has declared that he is a lady.”

“But,” protested Pilley, “he says that she--at least she says that
he----”

“You are getting mixed, Pilley,” interrupted the foreman. “This
appears to be a woman masquerading as a man and playing practical
jokes on a coroner’s jury. I suggest, sir, that we ought to have
evidence of identity.”

“I agree with you, emphatically,” said the coroner. “The
identification is indispensable. Is there anyone present who can swear
to the identity of this--er--person? Mr. Japp, for instance?”

“I’d rather you didn’t bring Mr. Japp into it,” said Angelina,
hastily. “It isn’t really necessary. If you will allow me to run home
and change my clothes, Mrs. Gillow and Dr. Strangeways will be able to
identify me. And I can bring some photographs to show the jury.”

“That seems quite a good suggestion,” said the coroner. “Don’t you
think so, gentlemen?”

“It is a very proper suggestion,” said the foreman, severely. “Let her
go away and clothe herself decently. How long will she be gone?”

“I shall be back in less than half an hour,” said Angelina; and on
this understanding she was given permission to retire. I watched her
with a tumult of mixed emotions as she took up her hat, gloves, and
stick, and strolled jauntily towards the door. There she paused for an
instant and shot at me a single, swift, whimsical glance through her
monocle. Then she went out; and with her disappeared for ever the
familiar figure of Peter Bundy.




 CHAPTER XVIII.
 THE UNCONTRITE PENITENT

As the door closed on Angelina, a buzz of excited talk broke out.
The astonished jurymen put their heads together and eagerly discussed
the new turn of events, while the coroner sat with a deeply cogitative
expression, evidently thinking hard and casting an occasional
speculative glance in Thorndyke’s direction. Meanwhile Cobbledick
edged up to my side and presented his views in a soft undertone.

“This is a facer, Doctor, isn’t it? Regular do. My word! Just think of
the artfulness of that young woman, toting us round and helping us to
find the things that she had just popped down for us to find. I call
it a masterpiece.” He chuckled admiringly, and added in a lower tone,
“I hope she hasn’t got herself into any kind of mess.”

I looked at Cobbledick with renewed appreciation. I had always liked
the sergeant. He was a capable man and a kindly one; and now he was
showing a largeness of soul that won my respect and my gratitude, too.
A small man would have been furious with Angelina, but Cobbledick took
her performances in a proper sporting spirit. He was only amused and
admiring. Not for nothing had Nature imprinted on his face that
benevolent smile.

Presently Mr. Pilley, who seemed to have a special gift for the
expression of erroneous opinions, addressed himself to the coroner.

“Well, Mr. Chairman,” he said cheerfully, “I suppose we can consider
the inquest practically over.”

“Over!” exclaimed the astonished coroner.

“Yes. We were inquiring into the death of Angelina Frood. But if Mrs.
Frood is alive after all, why, there’s an end to the matter.”

“What about the body in the mortuary?” demanded the foreman.

“Oh, ah,” said Pilley. “I had forgotten about that.”

He looked owlishly at the coroner and then exclaimed: “But that is the
body of Mrs. Frood!”

“It can’t be if Mrs. Frood is alive,” the coroner reminded him.

“But it must be,” persisted Pilley. “It has been identified as her,
and it had her clothes and ring on. Mr. Bundy must have been pulling
our legs.”

“There is certainly something very mysterious about that body,” said
the coroner. “It was dressed in Mrs. Frood’s clothes, as Mr. Pilley
points out, and it appears that Mrs. Frood must be in some way
connected with it.”

“There’s no doubt about that,” agreed the foreman. “She must know who
that dead person is and how the body came to be in the place where it
was found, and she will have to give an account of it.”

“Yes,” said the coroner. “But it is a mysterious affair. I wonder if
Dr. Thorndyke could enlighten us. He seems to know more about the
matter than anybody else.”

But Thorndyke was not to be drawn into any statement. “It would be
merely a conjecture on my part,” he said. “Presumably Mrs. Frood knows
how the remains got into the wall, and I must leave her to give the
necessary explanations.”

“I don’t see what explanations she can give,” said the foreman. “It
looks like a clear case of wilful murder. And it is against her.”

To this view the coroner gave a guarded assent; and indeed it was the
obvious view. There was the body, in Angelina’s clothing, and
everything pointed clearly to Angelina’s complicity in the crime, if
there had really been a crime committed. And what other explanation
was possible?

As I reflected on the foreman’s ominous words, I was sensible of a
growing alarm. What if Angelina had been, as it were, snatched from
the grave only to be placed in the dock on a charge of murder? That
she could possibly be guilty of a crime did not enter my mind. But
there was evidently some sort of criminal entanglement from which she
might find it hard to escape. The appearances were sinister in the
extreme; her simulated disappearance, her disguise, her suspicious
silence during the inquiry; to any eye but mine they were conclusive
evidence of her guilt. And the more I thought about it, the more
deadly did the sum of that evidence appear, until, as the time ran on,
I became positively sick with terror.

The opening of a door and a sudden murmur of surprise caused me to
turn; and there was Angelina herself. But not quite the Angelina that
I remembered. Gone were the pallid complexion, the weary, dark-circled
eyes, the down-cast mouth, the sad and pensive countenance, the dark,
strong eye-brows. Rosy-cheeked, smiling, confident, and looking
strangely tall and imposing, she stepped composedly over to the head
of the table, and stood there gazing with calm self-possession, and
the trace of a smile at the stupefied jurymen.

“Your name is--?” said the coroner, gazing at her in astonishment.

“Angelina Frood,” was the quiet reply; and the voice was Bundy’s
voice.

Here Pilley rose, bubbling with excitement. “This isn’t the same
person!” he exclaimed. “Why, he was a little man, and she’s a tall
woman. And his hair was short, and just look at hers! You can’t grow a
head of hair like that in twenty minutes.”

“No,” Angelina agreed, suavely. “I wish you could.”

“The objection is not relevant, Mr. Pilley,” said the coroner,
suppressing a smile. “We are not concerned with the identity of Mr.
Bundy but with that of Angelina Frood. Can anyone identify this lady?”

“I can,” said I. “I swear that she is Angelina Frood.”

“And Mrs. Gillow?”

Mrs. Gillow could and did identify her late lodger, and furthermore,
burst into tears and filled the court-room with “yoops” of hysterical
joy. When she had been pacified and gently restrained by the coroner’s
officer from an attempt to embrace the witness, the coroner proceeded:

“Now, Mrs. Frood, the jury require certain explanations from you, in
regard to the body of a woman which is at present lying in the
mortuary and which was found buried in the city wall with certain
articles of clothing and jewellery which have been identified as your
property. Did you know that that body had been buried in the wall?”

“Yes,” replied Angelina.

“Do you know how it came to be in the wall?”

“Yes. I put it there.”

“You put it there!” roared Pilley, amidst a chorus of exclamations
from the jurymen. The coroner held up his hand to enjoin silence and
asked, as he gazed in astonishment at Angelina.

“Can you tell us who this deceased person was?”

“I’m afraid I can’t,” Angelina replied, apologetically. “I don’t think
her name was known.”

“But--er--” the astounded coroner inquired, “how did she come by her
death?”

“I’m afraid I can’t tell you that either,” replied Angelina. “The fact
is, I never asked.”

“You never asked!” the coroner repeated, in a tone of bewilderment.
“But--er--are we to understand that--in short, did you or did you not
cause the death of this person by your own act? Of course,” he added
hastily, “you are not bound to answer that question.”

Angelina smiled at him engagingly. “I will answer with pleasure. I did
not cause the death of this person.”

“Then are we to understand that she was already dead when you found
her?”

“I didn’t find her. I bought her; at a shop in Great St.
Andrew-street. I gave four pounds, fourteen and three-pence for her,
including two and three-pence to Carter Paterson’s. I’ve brought the
bill with me.”

She produced the bill from her pocket and handed it to the coroner,
who read it with a portentous frown and a perceptible twitching at the
corners of his mouth.

“I will read this document to you, gentlemen,” he said in a slightly
unsteady voice. “It is dated the 19th of April, and reads: ‘Bought of
Oscar Hammerstein, Dealer in Human and Comparative Osteology, Great
St. Andrew-street, London, W.C., one complete set superfine human
osteology, disarticulated and unbleached (female), as selected by
purchaser, four pounds eight shillings and sixpence. Replacing and
cementing missing teeth, one shilling and sixpence. Packing case, two
shillings. Carriage, two and three pence. Total, four pounds, fourteen
and three-pence. Received with thanks, O. Hammerstein.’ Perhaps you
would like to see the bill, yourselves, gentlemen.”

He passed it to the foreman, taking a quick glance out of the corners
of his eyes at the bland and impassive Angelina, and the jury studied
it in a deep silence, which was broken only by a soft, gurgling sound,
from somewhere behind me, which, I discovered, on looking round, to
proceed from Sergeant Cobbledick, whose crimsoned face was partly
hidden by a large handkerchief and whose shoulders moved convulsively.

Presently the coroner addressed Thorndyke. “In continuation of your
evidence, Doctor, does Mrs. Frood’s explanation agree with any
conclusions that you had arrived at from your inspection of the
remains?”

“It agrees with them completely,” Thorndyke replied with a grim smile.

The coroner entered the answer in the depositions, and then turned
once more to Angelina.

“With regard to the objects that were found with the skeleton; did you
put them there?”

“Yes. I put in the metal things and a few pieces of scorched rag to
give a realistic effect--on account of the lime, you know.”

“And the articles that were recovered from the river, too, I suppose?”

“Yes, I put them down--with proper precautions, of course.”

“What do you mean by proper precautions?”

“Well, I couldn’t afford to waste any of the things, so I used to keep
a lookout with a telescope, and then, when I saw a likely person
coming along, I put one of the things down where it could be seen.”

“And were they always seen?”

“No. Some people are very unobservant. In that case I picked it up
when the coast was clear and saved it for another time.”

The coroner chuckled. “It was all very ingenious and complete. But
now, Mrs. Frood, we have to ask you what was the object of these
extraordinary proceedings. It was not a joke, I presume?”

“Oh, not at all,” replied Angelina. “It was a perfectly serious
affair. You have heard what sort of husband I had. I couldn’t possibly
live with him. I made several attempts to get away and live by myself,
but he always followed me and found me out. So I determined to
disappear altogether.”

“You could have applied for a separation,” said the coroner.

“I shouldn’t have got it,” replied Angelina, “and even if I had, of
what use would it have been? I should have been bound to him for life.
I couldn’t have married anyone else. My whole life would have been
spoilt. So I decided to disappear completely and for good, and start
life afresh in a new place and under a new name. And in order that
there should be no mistake about it, I thought I would leave
the--er--the material for a coroner’s inquest and a will directing
that a suitable monument should be put up over my grave. Then, if I
had ever married again, there would have been no danger of a charge of
bigamy. If anyone had made any such suggestion, I could have referred
them to the registrar of deaths and to the tombstone of Angelina Frood
in Rochester churchyard.”

“And as to a birth certificate under your new name?” the coroner asked
with a twinkle of his eye.

Angelina smiled a prim little smile. “I think that could have been
managed,” she said.

“Well,” said the coroner, “it was an ingenious scheme. But apparently
Dr. Thorndyke knew who Mr. Bundy was. How do you suppose he discovered
your identity?”

“That is just what I should like to know,” she replied.

“So should I,” said the coroner, with a broad smile; “but, of course,
it isn’t my affair or that of the jury. We are concerned with this
skeleton that you have planted on us. I suppose you can give us no
idea as to where it came from originally?”

“The dealer said it had been found in a barrow--not a wheel-barrow,
you know; an ancient burial-place. Of course, I don’t know whether he
was speaking the truth.”

“What do you think, Dr. Thorndyke?” the coroner asked.

“I think it is an ancient skeleton, though very well preserved. Some
of the teeth--the original ones--show more wear than one expects to
find in a modern skull. But I only made a cursory inspection.”

“I think the evidence is sufficient for our purpose,” said the
coroner; “and that really concludes the case, so we need not detain
you any longer, Mrs. Frood. I don’t know exactly what your legal
position is; whether you have committed any legal offence. If you
have, it is not our business; and I think I am expressing the
sentiments of the jury if I say that I hope that the authorities will
not make it their business. No one has been injured, and no action
seems to be called for.”

With these sentiments the jury concurred warmly, as also did Sergeant
Cobbledick, who was heard, very audibly and regardless of the
proprieties, to murmur “Hear, hear.” We waited to learn the nature of
the verdict, and when this had been pronounced (to the effect that the
skeleton was that of an unknown woman, concerning the circumstances of
whose death no evidence was available), the court rose and we prepared
to depart.

“You are coming back to lunch with us, Angelina?” said I.

“I should love to,” she replied, “but there is Mr. Japp. Do you think
you could ask him, too?”

“Of course,” I replied, with a sudden perception of the advantage of
even numbers. “We shouldn’t be complete without him.”

Japp accepted with enthusiasm, and, after a hasty farewell to
Cobbledick, we went forth into the High Street, by no means unobserved
of the populace. As we approached the neighbourhood of the office
Angelina said: “I must run into my rooms for a few moments just to
tidy myself up a little. It was such a very hurried toilette. I won’t
be more than a few minutes. You needn’t wait for me.”

“I suggest,” said Thorndyke, “that Mr. Japp and I go on and break the
news to Mrs. Dunk that there is a lady guest, and that Strangeways
remains behind to escort the prisoner.”

I fell in readily with this admirable suggestion, and as the two men
walked on, I followed Angelina up the steps and waited while she plied
her latch-key. We entered the hall together and then went into the
sitting-room, where she stood for a moment, looking round with deep
satisfaction.

“It’s nice to be home again,” she said, “and to feel that all that
fuss is over.”

“I daresay it is,” said I. “But now that you are home, what have you
got to say for yourself? You are a nice little baggage, aren’t you?”

“I am a little beast, John,” she replied. “I’ve been a perfect pig to
you. But I didn’t mean to be, and I really couldn’t help it. You’ll
try to forgive me, won’t you?”

“The fact is, Angelina,” I said, “I am afraid I am in love with you.”

“Oh, I hope to goodness you are, John,” she exclaimed. “If I thought
you weren’t I should wish myself a skeleton again. Do you think you
really are?”

She crept closer to me with such a sweet, wheedlesome air that I
suddenly caught her in my arms and kissed her.

“It does seem as if you were,” she admitted with a roguish smile; and
then--such unaccountable creatures are women--she laid her head on my
shoulder and began to sob. But this was only a passing shower. Another
kiss brought back the sunshine and then she tripped away to spread
fresh entanglements for the masculine heart.

In a few minutes she returned, further adorned and looking to my eyes
the very picture of womanly sweetness and grace. When I had given
confirmatory evidence of my sentiments towards her, we went out, just
in time to encounter Mrs. Gillow and acquaint her with the program.

“I suppose,” said Angelina, glancing furtively at a little party of
women who were glancing, not at all furtively, at her, “one should be
gratified at the interest shown by one’s fellow towns-people; but
don’t you think the back streets would be preferable to the
High-street?”

“It is no use, my dear,” I replied. “We’ve got to face it. Take no
notice. Regard these bipeds that infest the footways as mere samples
of the local fauna. Let them stare and ignore them. For my part, I
rather like them. They impress on me the admirable bargain that I have
made in swapping Peter Bundy for a beautiful lady.”

“Poor Peter,” she said, pensively. “He was a sad boy sometimes when he
looked at his big, handsome John and thought that mere friendship was
all that he could hope for when his poor little heart was starving for
love. Your deal isn’t the only successful one, John, so you needn’t be
so conceited. But here we are home--really home, this time, for this
has been my real home, John, dear. And there--Oh! Moses!--there is
Mrs. Dunk, waiting to receive us!”

“What used you to do to Mrs. Dunk,” I asked, “to make her so furious?”

“I only used to inquire after her health,” Angelina replied
plaintively. “But mum’s the word. She’ll spot my voice as soon as I
speak.”

Mrs. Dunk held the door open ceremoniously and curtsied as we entered.
She was a gruff old woman, but she had a deep respect for
“gentlefolk,” as is apt to be the way with old servants. Angelina
acknowledged her salutation with a gracious smile and followed her
meekly up the stairs to the room that Mrs. Dunk had allotted to her.

I found Thorndyke and Japp established in the library--Dr. Partridge
had dispensed with a drawing-room and I followed his excellent
example--and here presently Angelina joined us, sailing majestically
into the room and marching up to Thorndyke with an air at once hostile
and defiant.

“Serpent,” said Angelina.

“Not at all,” Thorndyke dissented with a smile. “You should be
grateful to me for having rescued you from your own barbed-wire
entanglements.”

“Serpent, I repeat,” persisted Angelina. “To let me sit in that
court-room watching all the innocents walking into my trap one after
another, and then, just as I thought they were all inside, to hand me
a thing like that!” and she produced, dramatically, a small sheet of
paper, which I recognized as the remainder of Thorndyke’s note. I took
it from her, and read: “You see whither the evidence is leading. The
deception cannot be maintained, nor is there any need, now that your
husband is dead. Explanations must be given either by you or by me.
For your own sake I urge you to explain everything and clear yourself.
Let me know what you will do.”

“This is an extraordinary document,” I said, passing it to Japp. “How
in the name of Fortune did you know that Bundy was Angelina?”

“Yes, how did you?” the latter demanded. “It is for you to give an
explanation now.”

“We will have the explanations after lunch,” said he; “mutual
explanations. I want to hear how far I was correct in details.”

“Very well,” agreed Angelina, “we will both explain. But you will have
the first innings. You are not going to listen to my explanation and
then say you knew all about it. And that reminds me, John, that you
had better tell Mrs. Dunk. She is sure to recognize my voice.”

I quite agreed with Angelina and hurried away to intercept Mrs. Dunk
and let her know the position. She was at first decidedly shocked, but
a vivid and detailed description of the late Mr. Frood produced a
complete revulsion; so complete, in fact, as to lead me to speculate
on the personal characteristics of the late Mr. Dunk. But her
curiosity was aroused to such an extent that, while waiting at table,
she hardly removed her eyes from Angelina, until the latter, finding
the scrutiny unbearable, suddenly produced the hated eye-glass, and,
sticking it in her eye, directed a stern glance at the old woman, who
instantly backed towards the door with a growl of alarm, and then
sniggered hoarsely.

It was a festive occasion, for we were all in exuberant spirits,
including Mr. Japp, who, if he said little, made up the deficiency in
smiles of forty-wrinkle power, which, together with his upstanding
tuft of white hair, made him look like a convivial cockatoo.

“Do you remember our last meeting at this table?” said Angelina, “when
I jeered at the famous expert and pulled his reverend leg, thinking
what a smart young fellow I was, and how beautifully I was bamboozling
him? And all the while he knew! He knew! And ‘Not a word said the
hard-boiled egg.’ Oh, serpent! serpent!”

Thorndyke chuckled. “You didn’t leave the hard-boiled egg much to
say,” he observed.

“No. But why were you so secret? Why didn’t you let on, just a little,
to give poor Bundy a hint as to where he was plunging?”

“My dear Mrs. Frood----”

“Oh, call me Angelina,” she interrupted.

“Thank you,” said he. “Well, my dear Angelina, you are forgetting that
I didn’t know what was in the wall.”

“My goodness!” she exclaimed. “I had overlooked that. Of course, it
might have been-- Good gracious! How awful!” She paused with her eyes
fixed on Thorndyke, and then asked: “Supposing it had been?”

“I refuse to suppose anything of the kind,” he replied. “My
explanations will deal with the actual, not with the hypothetical.”

There was silence for a minute or two. Like Angelina, I was
speculating on what Thorndyke would have done if the remains had been
real remains--and those of a man. He had evidently sympathized warmly
with the hunted wife; but if her defence had taken the form of a
crime, would he have exposed her? It was useless to ask him. I have
often thought about it since, but have never reached a conclusion.

“You will have to answer questions better than that presently,” said
Angelina; “but I won’t ask you any more now. You shall finish your
lunch in peace, and then--into the witness-box you go. I am going to
have satisfaction for that note.”

The little festival went on, unhurried, with an abundance of cheerful
and rather frivolous talk. But at last, like all fugitive things, it
came to an end. The table was cleared, and garnished with the port
decanter and the coffee service, and Mrs. Dunk, with a final glower,
half-defiant and half-admiring, at Angelina, took her departure.

“Now,” said Angelina, as I poured out the coffee, “the time has come
to talk of many things, but especially of expert investigations into
the identity of Peter Bundy. Your lead, Sir.”




 CHAPTER XIX.
 EXPLANATIONS

“The investigation of this case,” Thorndyke began, “falls naturally
into two separate inquiries: that relating to the crime and that which
is concerned with what we may conveniently call the personation. They
make certain contacts, but they are best considered separately. Let us
begin with the crime.

“Now, to a person having experience of real crime, there was, in this
case, from the very beginning, something rather abnormal. A woman of
good social position had disappeared. There was a suggestion that she
had been murdered; and the murder had apparently been committed in
some public place, that is to say, not in a house. But in such cases,
normally, the first evidence of the crime is furnished by the
discovery of the body. It is true that, in this case, there was a
suggestion that the body had been flung into the river, and this, at
first, masked the abnormality to some extent. But even then there was
the discrepancy that the brooch, which was attached to the person,
appeared to have been found on land, while the bag, which was not
attached to the person, was picked up at the water’s edge. The bag
itself, and the box which had been in it, presented several
inconsistencies.

“They had apparently been lying unnoticed for eleven days on a piece
of shore that was crowded with small craft and frequently by numbers
of seamen and labourers, and that formed a play-ground for the
waterside children. The clean state of the box when found showed that
it had neither been handled nor immersed, and as the wrapping-paper
was intact, the person who had taken it out of the bag must have
thrown it away without opening it to see what it contained. The bag
was found under some light rubbish. That rubbish had not been thrown
on it by the water, or the bag would have been soaked; and no one
could have thrown the rubbish on it without seeing the bag, which was
an article of some value. Again, the bag had not been carried to this
place by the water, as was proved by its condition.

“Therefore, either this was the place where the crime had been
committed, or someone had brought the bag to this place and thrown it
away. But neither supposition was reasonably probable. It was
inconceivable that a person like Mrs. Frood should have been in this
remote, inaccessible, disreputable place at such an hour. The bag
could not have been brought here by an innocent person, for no such
person would have thrown it away. It was quite a valuable bag. And a
guilty person would have thrown it in the river, and probably put a
stone in it to sink it. So you see that these first clues were
strikingly abnormal. They prepared one to consider the possibility of
false tracks. Even the brooch incident had a faint suggestion of the
same kind when considered with the other clues. The man who pawned the
brooch had a mole on his nose. Such an adornment can be easily
produced artificially. It is highly distinctive of the person who
possesses it, and it is equally distinctive--negatively--of the person
who does not possess it. Then there was the character of the person
who had disappeared. She was a woman who was seeking to escape from
her husband; and hitherto she had not succeeded because she had not
hidden herself securely enough. She was a person of a somewhat
disappearing tendency. She had an understandable motive for
disappearing.

“From the very beginning, therefore, the possibility of voluntary
disappearance had to be borne in mind. And when it was, each new clue
seemed to support it. There was the scarf, for instance. It was found
under a fish-trunk; an unlikely place for it to have got by chance,
but an excellent one for a ‘plant.’ The scarf was not baldly exposed,
but someone was sure to turn the trunk over and find it. And at this
point another peculiarity began to develop. There was a noticeable
tendency for the successive ‘finds’ to creep up the river from Chatham
towards Rochester Bridge. It was not yet very remarkable, but I
noticed it, as I entered each find on my map. The brooch was
associated with Chatham, the bag and box with the Chatham shore a
little farther up, the scarf with the Rochester shore at Blue Boar
Head. As I say, it attracted my attention; and when the first shoe was
found above Blue Boar Head, the second shoe farther up still, and the
hat-pin yet farther up towards the bridge, it became impossible to
ignore it. There was no natural explanation. Whether the body were
floating or stationary, the constancy of direction was inexplicable;
for the tide sweeps up and down twice daily, and objects detached from
the body would be carried up or down stream, according to the
direction of the tide when they became detached. This regular order
was a most suspicious circumstance. Later, when the objects were found
in Black Boy-lane, it became absurd. It was a mere paper-chase. Just
look at my map.”

He exhibited the large-scale map, on which each “find” was marked by a
small circle. The series of circles, joined by a connecting line,
proceeded directly from near Sun Pier, Chatham, along the shore, and
up Black Boy-lane to the gate of the waste ground, and across it to
the wall.

Angelina giggled. “You can’t say I didn’t make it as easy as I could
for poor old Cobbledick,” she said. “Of course, I never reckoned on
anyone bringing up the heavy guns. By the way, I wonder who your
private client was. Do you know, John?” she added, with a sudden
glance of suspicion; and, as I grinned sheepishly, she exclaimed:
“Well! I wouldn’t have believed it. It was a regular conspiracy. But I
am interrupting the expert. Proceed, my lord.”

“Well,” Thorndyke resumed, “we have considered the aspect of the crime
problem taken by itself, as it appeared to an experienced
investigator. From the first there was a suspicion that the clues were
counterfeit, and with each new clue this suspicion deepened. And you
will notice an important corollary. If the case was a fraud, that
fraud was being worked by someone on the spot. Keep that point in
mind, for it has a most significant bearing on the other problem, that
of the personation, to which we will now turn our attention. But
before we go into details, there are certain general considerations
that we ought to note, in order that we may understand more clearly
how the deception became possible.

“The subject of personation and disguise is often misunderstood. It is
apt to be supposed that a disguise effects a complete transformation
resulting in a complete resemblance to the individual personated--or,
as in this case, a complete disappearance of the identity of the
disguised person. But no such transformation is possible. All disguise
is a form of bluff. It acts by suggestion. And the suggestion is
effected by a set of misleading circumstances which produce in the
dupe a state of mind in which a very imperfect disguise serves to
produce conviction. That is the psychology of personation, and I can
only express my admiration of the way in which Angelina had grasped
it. Her conduct of this delicate deception was really masterly. Let us
consider it in more detail.

“Mr. Bundy was ostensibly a man. But if he had been put in a room with
a dozen moderately intelligent persons, and those persons had been
asked, ‘Is this individual a man? or is he a woman with short hair and
dressed in man’s clothing?’ they would probably have decided
unanimously that he was a woman. But the question never was asked. The
issue was never raised. He was Mr. Bundy. One doesn’t look at young
men to see if they are women in disguise.

“Then consider the position of Strangeways--the chosen victim. He
comes to a strange town to transact business with a firm of land
agents. He goes into the office, and finds the partners--whose names
are on the plate outside, and to whom he has been sent by his London
agent--engaged in their normal avocations. He transacts his business
with them in a normal way, and Mr. Bundy seems to be an ordinary,
capable young man. He goes back later and interviews Mr. Bundy, who is
just on the point of taking him to introduce him to Mrs. Frood, when
he is called away. Then, within a few minutes, he is taken to Mrs.
Frood’s house, where he finds that lady calmly engaged in needlework.
Supposing Mrs. Frood had been extremely like Bundy, could it possibly
have entered Strangeways’s head that they might be one and the same
person? Remember that he had left Bundy in another place only a few
minutes before; and here was Mrs. Frood in her own apartments, with
the appearance of having been there for hours. Obviously no such
thought could have occurred to any man. There was nothing to suggest
it.

“But, in fact, Angelina was not perceptibly like Bundy on cursory
inspection. They were markedly different in size. A woman always looks
bigger than a man of the same height. Bundy was a little man and
looked smaller than he was by reason of his very low heels; Angelina
was a biggish woman and looked taller than she was by reason of her
high heels and her hair. Disregarding her hair, she was fully two
inches taller than Bundy.

“Then the facial resemblance must have been slight. Angelina had a
mass of hair and wore it low down on her brows and temples; Bundy’s
hair was short and was brushed back from his forehead. Angelina had
strong, black eyebrows; Bundy’s eyebrows were thin, or rather, cut off
short. Angelina was pale, careworn, dark under the eyes, with drooping
mouth, melancholy expression and depressed in manner; Bundy was
fresh-coloured, smiling, gay and sprightly in manner and he wore an
eye-glass--which has a surprising effect on facial expression. Their
voices and intonation were strikingly different. Finally, Strangeways
never saw Angelina excepting in a very subdued light in which any
small resemblances in features would be unnoticeable.

“And now observe another effect of suggestion. Strangeways had made
the acquaintance of Mr. Bundy. Then he had made the acquaintance of
Mrs. Frood. They were two separate persons; they were practically
strangers to one another; they belonged to different sets of
surroundings. He would never think of them in connexion with one
another. They were two of his friends, mutually unacquainted. In this
condition of separateness they would become established in his mind,
and the conception of them as different persons would become confirmed
by habit. It would be a permanent suggestion that would offer an
obstacle to any future suggestion that they were the same. That was
the advantage of introducing Bundy first, for if he had appeared only
after Angelina had disappeared, there would have been no such opposing
suggestion. The resemblances might have been noticed, and he might
have been detected.

“In passing I may remark upon the tact and judgment that were shown in
the disguise. The troublesome make-up, the wig, the false eyebrows,
the grease-paint, the false voice, all were concentrated on the
temporary Mrs. Frood, who was to disappear. Bundy was not disguised at
all, excepting for the eye-glass. He was simply Angelina with her hair
cut short and dressed as a man. He hadn’t even an assumed voice; for
as Angelina is a contralto, and habitually speaks in the lower
register, her voice would pass quite well as a light tenor, so long as
she kept off the ‘head notes.’

“So much for the general aspects of the case. And now as to my own
position. As I had never seen Angelina, I naturally should not
perceive any resemblance to her in Bundy; but, equally with
Strangeways, I was subject to the suggestion that Bundy was a man. The
personal equation, however, was different. It is my professional habit
to reject all mental suggestion so far as is possible; to sift out the
facts and consider them with an open mind regardless of what they
appear to suggest. And then you are to remember that when I first met
Mr. Bundy, there was already in my mind a faint suspicion that this
was not a genuine crime; that things were not quite what they
appeared; and that if this were the case, the clues were being
manipulated by somebody on the spot.

“When I met Mr. Bundy, I looked him over as I look over every person
whom I meet for the first time; and that inspection yielded one or two
rather remarkable facts. I noticed that he wore exceptionally low
heels and that he had several physical characteristics that were
distinctively feminine. The very low heels puzzled me somewhat. If
they had been exceptionally high there would have been nothing in it.
But why should a noticeably short man wear almost abnormally low
heels? I could think of no reason, unless he wore them for greater
comfort, but I noted the fact and reserved it for further
consideration.

“Of his physical peculiarities, the first that attracted my attention
was the shape of his hands. They were quite of the feminine type. Of
course, hands vary, but still it was a fact to be noted, and the
observation caused me to look him over a little more critically; and
then I discovered a number of other feminine characteristics.

“Perhaps it may be useful to consider briefly the less obvious
differences between the sexes--the more obvious ones would, of course,
be provided for by the disguise. There are two principal groups of
such differences; the one has reference to the distribution of bulk,
the other to the direction of certain lines. Let us take the
distribution of bulk. This exhibits opposite tendencies in the two
sexes. In the female, the great mass is central--the hip region; and
from this the form diminishes in both directions. The whole figure,
including the arms, is contained in an elongated ellipse. And the
tendency affects the individual members. The limbs are bulky where
they join the trunk, they taper pretty regularly towards the
extremities, and they terminate in relatively small hands and feet.
The hands themselves taper as a whole, and the individual fingers
taper markedly from a comparatively thick base to a pointed tip.

“In the male figure the opposite condition prevails; it tends to be
acromegalous. The central mass is relatively small, the peripheral
masses is relatively large. The hip region is narrow, and there is a
great widening towards the shoulders. The limbs taper much less
towards the extremities, and they terminate in relatively large hands
and feet. So, too, with the hands; they tend to be square in shape,
and the individual fingers--excepting the index finger--are nearly as
broad at the tips as at the base.

“Of the second group of differences we need consider only one or two
instances. The general rule is that certain contour lines tend in the
male to be vertical or horizontal in direction and in the female to be
oblique. A man’s neck, at the back, is nearly straight and vertical; a
woman’s shows a sweeping oblique curve. The angle of a man’s lower jaw
is nearly a right angle; there is a vertical and a horizontal ramus. A
woman’s lower jaw has an open angle and its contour forms an oblique
line from the ear to the chin. But the most distinctive difference is
in the ear itself. A man’s ear has its long diameter vertical; a
woman’s has the long diameter oblique; and the obliquity is usually
very marked.

“Bearing these differences in mind, and remembering that they are
subject to variation in individual cases, let us now return to Mr.
Bundy. His hands, as I have said, had the feminine character. His feet
were small even for a small man; his ears were set obliquely and the
line of his jaw was oblique with an open angle. His shoulders had
evidently been made up by the tailor, and he seemed rather wide across
the hips for a man. In short, all those bodily characteristics which
were not concealed or disguised by the clothing were feminine. It was
a rather remarkable fact; so much so that I began to ask myself if it
were possible that he might actually be a woman in disguise.

“I watched him narrowly. There was nothing distinctive in his walk,
but there was in the movements of the arms. He flourished his stick
jauntily enough, but he had not that ‘nice conduct of a clouded cane’
that is as much a social cachet in our day as it was in the days of
good Queen Anne. It needs a skill born of years of practice to manage
a stick properly, as one realizes when one sees the working man taking
his Malacca for its Sunday morning walk. Mr. Bundy had not that skill.
His stick was a thing consciously carried; it was not a part of
himself. Then the movement of the free arm was feminine. When a woman
swings her arm she swings it through a large arc, especially in the
backward direction--probably to avoid her hip--and the palm of the
hand tends to be turned backward. A man’s free arm either hangs
motionless or swings slightly, unless he is walking very fast; it
swings principally forward, and the palm of his hand inclines inwards.
These are small matters, but their cumulative significance is great.

“Further, there was the mental habit. Bundy was jocose and playfully
ironic. But a gentleman of twenty-five doesn’t ‘pull the leg’ of a
gentleman of fifty whom he knows but slightly; whereas a lady of
twenty-five does. And very properly,” he added, seeing that Angelina
had turned rather pink. “That is a compliment in a young lady which
would be an impertinence in a young man. No doubt, when the equality
of the sexes is an accomplished fact, things will be different.”

“It will never be an accomplished fact,” said Angelina. “The equality
of the sexes is like the equality of the classes. The people who roar
for social equality are the under-dogs; and the women who shout for
sex equality are the under-cats. Normal women are satisfied with
things as they are.”

“Hearken unto the wisdom of Angelina,” said Thorndyke, with a smile.
“But perhaps she is right. It may be that the women who are so eager
to compete with men are those who can’t compete with women. I can’t
say. I have never been a woman: whereas Angelina has the advantage of
being able to view the question from both sides.

“The _prima facie_ evidence, then, suggested that Mr. Bundy was a
woman. But as this was a _prima facie_ improbability, the matter had
to be gone into further. On Mr. Bundy’s cheeks and chin was a faint
blue colouration, suggestive of such a growth of whiskers and beard as
would be appropriate to his age. Now if those whiskers and that beard
were genuine, the other signs were fallacious. Mr. Bundy must be a
man. But his cheeks looked perfectly smooth and clean; and it was
about seven o’clock in the evening. My own cheeks and Strangeways’
were by this time visibly prickly; and as he had been with us all day,
Mr. Bundy could not have shaved since the morning. I tried vainly to
get a closer view, and was considering how it could be managed when
Providence intervened.”

“I know,” said Angelina. “It was that beastly mosquito.”

“Yes,” agreed Thorndyke. “But even then I could not get a chance to
look at the skin closely. But when we got Mr. Bundy into the surgery,
and examined the bite through a lens, the murder was out.”

“You could see there were no whiskers?” said Angelina.

“It wasn’t that,” replied Thorndyke. “It was something much more
conclusive. You may know that the whole of the human body excepting
the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, and the eyelids, is
covered with a fine down, technically called the lanugo. It consists
of minute, nearly colourless hairs set quite closely together, and may
be seen as a sort of halo on the face of a woman or child when the
edge of the contour is against the light. On the face of a
clean-shaved man it is, of course, absent, as it is shaved off with
the whiskers. Now on Mr. Bundy’s face the lanugo was intact all over
the blue area. It followed that he had never been shaved. It further
followed that the blue colouration was an artificial stain. But this
made it practically a certainty that Mr. Bundy was a woman.

“The question now was: If Mr. Bundy was a woman, what woman was he?
The obvious answer seemed to be, Angelina Frood. She was missing; but
if the disappearance was an imposture, someone on the spot was
planting the clues. That someone would most probably be Mrs. Frood,
herself. But if she were lurking in the neighbourhood, she must be
disguised; and here was a disguised woman. Nevertheless, obvious as
the suggestion was, the thing suggested seemed to be impossible.
Strangeways knew both Angelina and Bundy and he had not recognized the
latter; and I had a vague impression that he had seen them together,
which, of course, would absolutely exclude their identity. A little
judicious conversation with him, however, showed that neither
objection had any weight. He had never seen them both at one time; and
his description of Mrs. Frood made it clear that she had appeared to
him totally unlike Bundy.

“The next thing was to ascertain definitely if this woman really was
Mrs. Frood, and fortunately I had the means of making a very simple
test. Strangeways had given me a photograph of Angelina bearing the
address of a theatrical photographer, and from him I obtained seven
different photographs in various poses. Then I received from
Strangeways the group-photograph that was taken of us by the city
wall, which contained an excellent portrait of Mr. Bundy. Out of this
photograph I cut a small square containing Bundy’s head, soaked it in
oil of bergamot, and mounted it in Canada balsam on a glass plate.
This made the paper quite transparent, so I now had a transparent
positive. I selected from the photographs of Angelina one that was in
a pose exactly similar to the portrait of Bundy--practically full
face--and treated it in the same way. Then I handed the two
transparencies to my assistant, and he, by means of our big copying
camera, produced two life-sized negatives, exactly alike in
dimensions. With prints from these negatives we were able to perform
some experiments. From Angelina’s portrait I carefully cut out the
face, leaving the hair and neck, and slipped Bundy’s portrait behind
it, so that his face appeared through the hole. We could now see how
Bundy looked with Angelina’s hair, and, on putting it beside an
untouched portrait of Angelina, it was obvious, in spite of the
eye-glass, that it was the same face. For you must remember that the
Angelina that we had was the real person, not the made-up Angelina
whom Strangeways had seen.

“This success encouraged us to take a little more trouble. My man,
Polton, made some black paper masks, with the aid of which he produced
two composite photographs, one of which had Bundy’s face and
Angelina’s hair, neck, and bust, while the other had Angelina’s face
and Bundy’s hair, forehead, neck, and bust. The eye-glass was the
disturbing factor, though it showed very little, and Bundy managed it
so skilfully that it hardly affected the shape of the eye and the set
of the brow. Still, it was necessary to eliminate it, and as painting
was out of our province, we invoked the aid of Mrs. Anstey, who is a
very talented portrait painter and miniaturist. She touched out the
joins in the composites, painted out the eye-glass in the one and
painted an eye-glass into the other. And now the identity was
complete. The Bundy-Angelina portrait was identical with the
photographer’s portrait, and the Angelina-Bundy photograph was Mr.
Bundy to the life.

“However, we made a final test. Polton reduced the Bundy-Angelina
portrait to cabinet size, and made a couple of carbon prints, which I
brought down here and exhibited; and as Strangeways accepted them as
portraits of Angelina, I considered the proof complete.”

Here Angelina interrupted: “But what about that brooch? I never had a
brooch like that.”

Thorndyke smiled a grim smile. “I asked Mrs. Anstey to paint in a
brooch of a characteristic design.”

“What for?” asked Angelina.

“Ah!” said Thorndyke, “thereby hangs a tale.”

“Oh! a serpent’s tail, I suppose,” said Angelina.

“You will be able to judge presently,” he replied. “The brooch had its
uses. Well, to continue: The identity of Mr. Bundy was now established
as a moral certainty. But it was not certain enough for legal
purposes. I wanted conclusive evidence; and I wanted to ascertain
exactly how the transformation effects were worked. I had noted that
Bundy and Angelina occupied adjoining houses which were virtually the
two moieties of a double house with a common covered passageway. I
assumed that the two houses communicated, but it was necessary to
ascertain if they really did. The only way to establish the facts was
to inspect the house in which Angelina had lived, and this I
determined to do, in the very faint hope that I might be able, at the
same time, to get one or more of Angelina’s finger-prints. I made a
pretext for visiting the house with Strangeways, and we had the
extraordinary good luck to find Mrs. Gillow just going out, so we had
the house to ourselves. But this was not the only piece of luck, for
we found that Angelina had taken a drink from the bedroom tumbler and
water-bottle before going out, and had left on them a complete set of
beautiful finger-prints, of which I secured a number of admirable
photographs.

“Examination of the basement showed that I was right as to the
communication. Both houses had a side door opening into the
passage-way, and both doors were fitted with Yale latches which looked
as if they were opened with the same key. The passage was little used,
but the gravel between the two doors was a good deal trodden, and
there were numerous finger-prints on Angelina’s side-door. In the
kitchen was a large cupboard fitted with a Yale lock on the door and
pegs inside. I assumed that when Angelina was at home that cupboard
contained a suit of Mr. Bundy’s clothes, and that when Mr. Bundy was
in the office it contained a wig and a dress and a pair of lady’s
shoes.

“Well, that made the evidence fairly complete with one exception. We
had to get a set of Bundy’s finger-prints to compare with Angelina’s.
That was where the brooch came in. I knew that when Mr. Bundy saw a
portrait of his former self with a brooch that he had never possessed,
his curiosity would be aroused, and he would examine that portrait
closely. And so he did. And on my asking him to compare the two
prints, he took the opportunity to pick them both up, one in each
hand, to scrutinize them more minutely, and find out who the
photographer was. When he put them down, they bore a complete, though
invisible, set of his finger-prints. Later, Mr. Bundy went home,
escorted by Strangeways. As soon as they were gone, I took the
photographs up to my room, developed up the finger-prints with powder,
and compared them minutely, line by line, with the photographs of
those on the tumbler and bottle. They were identical. The
finger-prints of Bundy were the finger-prints of Angelina Frood.

“That completed the case; and if I had known what Angelina’s
intentions were I should have notified Bundy that ‘the game was up.’
But I was in the dark. I could do nothing until I knew whether she was
going to produce a body, and if so, whose body it would be. The city
wall was in my mind as a possibility, since I had noted the curious
disappearance of the gate-key on that significant date and I had heard
of the story of Bill the bargee and knew that Bundy had heard it, and
apparently taken it seriously. But one can’t act on conjecture. I
could only watch Angelina play her game and try to follow the moves.
When the paper-chase turned up Black Boy-lane, I knew that the
wall-burial was intended to be discovered. But I didn’t know what was
in the wall, and I may say that I was rather alarmed. For if Angelina
had taken the story of Bill as a reliable precedent and had buried a
real body in quicklime, there was going to be a catastrophe. It was an
immense relief to me when I got Strangeways’ report that only a
skeleton had been found; for I knew then that only a skeleton had been
buried and that no crime had been committed. That is all I have to
tell; and now it is Angelina’s turn to enter the confessional.”

“You haven’t left me much to tell,” said Angelina. “I feel as if I had
been doing the thimble and pea trick with glass thimbles. However, I
will fill in a few details. This scheme first occurred to me when I
came down here to take over the property that had been left to me. I
put it confidentially to Uncle Japp, but he was so shocked that he has
never been able to get his hair to lie down since. He wouldn’t hear of
it. So I asked him to lunch with poor Nicholas; and after that he was
ready to agree to anything. Accordingly I made my preparations. I got
a theatrical wig-maker to cut off my hair and make it into a wig (I
told him I had a man’s part and it was expected to be a long run), got
a suit made by a theatrical costumier, and down I came as Mr. Bundy.
Uncle J. had already had the new plate put up. The next door offices
and basement were empty, so we got them furnished for Angelina, and as
soon as the wig was ready, down she came and took possession.

“Up to this time the third act was a bit sketchy. I had arranged the
disappearance, and the recovery of the clues from the river, and I had
a plan of buying a mummy, dressing it in my clothes, and burying it in
the marshes close to the shore, where I could discover it when it had
matured sufficiently. But I didn’t much like the plan. I didn’t know
enough about mummies, and some other people might know too much. It
looked as if I should have to do without a body, and leave my death to
mere rumour; which would be unsatisfactory. I did want a tombstone.

“About this time an angel of the name of Turcival--he lives in Adam
and Eve-street, Adelphi, bless him!--sent a Dr. Strangeways down here.
He was a regular windfall--a new doctor--and I gave him my entire
attention. I took him to his own proposed premises, and kept him in
conversation, to let my personality soak well in. That evening I
interviewed him in the office, and let him suppose that I was going to
take him to Mrs. Frood’s house and introduce him to her. Then, when I
suddenly remembered an engagement elsewhere, I went out, and as soon
as the office door was shut, down I darted into our basement, out at
the side door, in at the other side door, and into Mrs. Frood’s
kitchen. There I did a lightning change; slipped on my dress and wig,
stuck on my eyebrows, and made up my complexion; flew up the stairs,
lighted the lamp in the sitting-room, and spread myself out with my
needle-work. But I hadn’t been settled more than two or three minutes
when Uncle Japp arrived, leading the lamb to the slaughter.

“Then it turned out that I had struck a bit of luck that I hadn’t
bargained for. John had attended me in London and knew something of my
affairs; so I appointed him my physician in ordinary on the spot. It
was rare sport. The concern poor old John showed for my grease-paint
was quite touching. I sat there squeaking complaints to him and
receiving his sympathy until I was ready to screech with laughter. But
I felt rather a pig all the same, for John was so sweet, and he was
such a man and such a gentleman. However, I had to go on when once I
had begun.

“But it was a troublesome business, worse than any stage job I ever
had, to keep these two people going. I had to rush through from the
office into the kitchen and cook things that I didn’t want, just to
make a noise and a smell of cooking, and listen to Mrs. Gillow so that
I could pop up the stairs at the psychological moment and remind her
that I lived there; and then to fly down and change and dart through
into the office, so that people could see that I was occupied there.
It was frightfully hard work, and anxious, too. I can tell you, it was
a relief when I heard from Miss Cumbers that Nicholas was starting for
Brighton, and that I could disappear without implicating him. However,
there is no need for me to go into any more details. Your imaginations
can fill those in.”

“The man with the mole, I take it,” said Thorndyke, “was----”

“Yes. I got a suit of slops in the Minories. The mole, of course, was
built up, with toupee-paste.”

“By the way,” said Thorndyke, “was there any necessity for Bundy at
all?”

“Well, I had to be somebody, you know, and I had to stay on the spot
to work the clues and keep an eye on the developments. I couldn’t be a
woman because that would have required a heavy make-up that would
almost certainly have been spotted, and would have been an intolerable
bore; whereas Bundy, as you have pointed out, was not a disguise at
all. When once I had got my hair cut and had provided myself with the
clothes and eye-glass, there was no further trouble. I could have
lived comfortably as Bundy for the rest of my life.

“So that is my story,” Angelina concluded; “and,” she added, with a
sudden change of manner, “I am your grateful debtor for ever. You have
done far more for me even than you know. Only this morning, poor Peter
Bundy was a forlorn little wretch, miserably anxious about the present
and looking to a future that had nothing but empty freedom to offer.
And now I am the happiest of women--for I should be a hypocrite if I
pretended to have any regrets for poor Nicholas. I will say good-bye
to him in his coffin and give him a decent funeral, and try to think
of him as he was before he sank into the depths. But I am frankly glad
that he is gone; out of his own miserable life and out of mine. And
his going, which would never have been known but for the wisdom of the
benevolent serpent, has left me free, with a promise of a happiness
that even he does not guess.”

“I am not so sure of that,” said Thorndyke, with a sly smile.

“Well, neither am I, now you come to mention it,” said she, smiling at
him in return. “He is an inquiring and observant serpent, with a way
of nosing out all sorts of things that he is not supposed to be aware
of. And after all, perhaps he has a right to know. It is proper that
the giver should have the satisfaction of realizing the preciousness
of that which he has given.”



Here endeth the Mystery of Angelina Frood. And yet it is not quite the
end. Indeed, the end is not yet; for the blessed consequences still
continue to develop like the growth of a fair tree. The story has
dwindled to a legend whose harmless whispers call but a mischievous
smile to that face that, like the dial in our garden, acknowledges
only the sunshine. Mrs. Dunk, it is true, still wages public war, but
it is tempered by private adoration; and almost daily baskets of
flowers, and even tomatoes and summer cabbages, arrive at our house,
accompanied by the beaming smile and portly person of Inspector
Cobbledick.
