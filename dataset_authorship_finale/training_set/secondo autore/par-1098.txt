NOTE. _An asterisk before a title indicates distinction. This list includes single short stories, collections of short stories, textbooks, and a few continuous narratives based on short stories previously published in magazines. Volumes announced for publication in the autumn of 1919 are listed here, though in some cases they had not yet appeared at the time this book went to press._
