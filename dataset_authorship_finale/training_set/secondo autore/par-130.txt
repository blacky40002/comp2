"A year ago is dead and buried. Let it alone. Think of the live things; think of the Now! There 's a big, strong world all around you, pulsating with life; there 's sunshine in the morning and stars at night--and they are alive; there are flowers, and birds, and grasses--all alive; there are live men and women, live questions, and there is your sister. The world would be alive--would be worth while if you had only her. She 's a world in herself."
