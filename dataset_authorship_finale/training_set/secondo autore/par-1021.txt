I used to wonder about Moira, too, when she'd have these quiet spells--like she was _listening_, but not to any sounds. Then next you'd feel as if she was gladder than anything you'd ever known, sitting there so still with that listening look on her face--only now like I told you, as if she'd _heard_. She'd be so happy inside that you'd like to be near her, as if there was a light in her heart so you could warm yourself by it.
