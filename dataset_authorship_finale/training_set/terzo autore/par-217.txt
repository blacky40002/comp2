By the time the duel was over, the long, northern twilight was drawing to a close. The decks of the _Cristobal_ were cleared of the dead bodies and the wreckage of guns and spars. The torn rigging was partially repaired; a few sails were set; and the shattered tiller was replaced. The prisoners (wounded and bound together, they did not number a dozen) were divided between the ships. A prize-crew of seven, under the first mate's command, went aboard the _Cristobal_. Then the boarding-irons were cast loose, and the vessels fell away from each other to a safe distance.
