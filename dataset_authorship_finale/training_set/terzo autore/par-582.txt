On their way through to Dan’l Evans’s farm behind the long-gaited strawberry mare, the deputy-sheriff and Young Dan bought as much food as two good men could pack a day’s journey from Amos Bissing at the Bend. Mr. Bissing was deeply impressed by Young Dan’s company and appearance. He asked a great many questions and received a good many answers—but not a single answer to his questions as to the deputy-sheriff’s reasons for touring the country in Young Dan’s company. He could see easily enough by the manners of the two that their relations were entirely friendly.
