The magician ate very little for a hungry youth, and yet the stew was excellent. Before he touched the food, he was seen to cast aside from his waist a girdle of white leather painted with many wonderful figures of gods and men and beasts.

Opening his eyes, he beheld her busy at the cooking-fire, singing as she worked.
