Spotted Seal felt like a man in the clutches of an awful dream, during the first few minutes of his flight. The world--river, forest, and hill--sped backward beneath him with sickening velocity. The air sang in his ears, and his breath seemed beaten back against mouth and nostrils. The glory of the morning and the rushing air upon his eyeballs, almost blinded him, and the fear of falling to earth was so strong in him that he continued, for some time, to exert every muscle, like a runner in a race.
