Just then Ouenwa pointed northward to the wooded bluff that cut into the white valley and hid the settlement from the lower reaches of the river. From beyond the point, moving slowly and unsteadily, appeared a solitary human figure.

It approached uncertainly, as if without a definite goal, and, when within a few hundred yards of the fort, staggered and fell prone.
