It was now time to start. Hastily cutting off a length of string from his string-box--for Silas was an orderly man and despised the oddments of string with which many people make shift--he tied it to the dead man’s bag and umbrella and slung them from his shoulder. Then he folded up the paper of broken glass, and, slipping it and the spectacles into his pocket, picked up the body and threw it over his shoulder. Brodski was a small, spare man, weighing not more than nine stone; not a very formidable burden for a big, athletic man like Silas.
