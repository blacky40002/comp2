“Dr. Strangeways? My name is Anstey. I do most of the court work in connexion with Thorndyke’s cases, and I am representing him here to-day. He had hoped to come down, himself, but he had to go into the country on some important business, so I have to come to keep the nest warm--to watch the proceedings and make a summary of the evidence. You mentioned to him that the case would take more than one day.”
