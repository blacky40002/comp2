This was pleasant hearing. A half an hour each way and a half an hour at the patient's house. At that rate it would be half-past ten before I was home again, and then it was quite probable that I should find some other untimely messenger waiting on the doorstep.

Instantly the coachman slammed the door and turned the key, leaving me in total darkness.
