Barnes threw himself down flat and elbows on the ground rested his chin in his hands. Below him in shadow lay all that vast unexplored country upon which only yesterday he had gazed with her by his side. To-night it was boundless--limitless.

The pictures a man would bring back with him--Ah, they would be pictures of Hell.
