“Be sensible. This man is not anything in particular to you, and even if he is your guest there is nothing you can do to relieve his plight. He is only a figure in real life and you know you are not greatly concerned about such. They are merely shadows. Come with me and I will show you the substance--men who are men. I will reveal to you the raw, crude inwardness of men. You will be wiser--and safer.”
