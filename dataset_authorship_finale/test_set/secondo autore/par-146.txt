Allston had fallen. The curtain had been rung down. For all he knew it was final. And yet in the course of time the curtain began to rise again. Light--the emblem of life--filtered through his eyes and made itself a conscious fact in his half-paralyzed brain. That was all he was aware of at first--just light; a pale, cold light like that of dawn. It was quite meaningless and without warmth. It roused no emotions in him; little interest. It just was; nothing more.
