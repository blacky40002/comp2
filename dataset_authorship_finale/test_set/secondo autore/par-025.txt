She received no answer. The man who had been here yesterday--who would have responded to her lightest whisper--did not count. And if he could have answered as of yesterday, that would not have counted. It was to-day--now--that she wanted him. It was this minute--this second. She wanted him to come to her and place his arms about her and hold her tight; she wanted the feel of his lips and the sound of his voice. She wanted him in the flesh with all his tousled light hair. She was empty without him--as empty as a mother with an unweighted arm.
