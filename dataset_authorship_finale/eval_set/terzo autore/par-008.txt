It was dinner time when Jim Hammond awoke from his sleep of physical and nervous exhaustion. He was puzzled to know where he was at first, but the memory of the night's adventure came to him, bringing both shame and relief. He had no watch to tell him the time, and there was no clock in the room. He had brought nothing with him--not a watch, or a dollar, or a shirt--nothing except his guilt and his shame. He flinched at the thought of meeting Mrs. Starkley and the girls.
