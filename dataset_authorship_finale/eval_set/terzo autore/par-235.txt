Now when I was Cock o' the River, afore the rheumatiz put a crimp into me, I allers sized a stranger up--meanin' a man from outside--afore I give 'im the dare to fight. Cuffin' logs an' the like o' that's different, for there's ony one best way at that game an' that's the way we do right here on Racket River--but there's a dozen ways o' fightin'. Yes, a dozen ways an' maybe more, an' a man wants to be danged careful how he jumps into a scrap with a stranger."
