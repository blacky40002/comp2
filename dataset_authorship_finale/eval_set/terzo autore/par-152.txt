Dave had intended to sleep that afternoon, but the excitement caused by the news of his promotion made it impossible. He who had never missed a minute's slumber through fear of death was set fluttering at heart and nerves by the two worsted "pips" on each sleeve of his borrowed jacket. The coat was borrowed--but the right to wear the stars was his, his very own, earned in Flanders. He toured the trenches--fire, communication and support--feeling that his stars were as big as pie plates.
