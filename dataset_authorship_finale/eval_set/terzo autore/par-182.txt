Jim reached the thicket from which a thin plume of smoke arose straight into the still air. He freed the floundering dogs of their burdens, dragged the girl through the tangle and deposited her in the den and sank on his face beside her.

Her eyes were open and their green gaze was fixed anxiously and wonderingly upon him.
