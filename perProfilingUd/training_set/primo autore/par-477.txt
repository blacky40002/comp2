“We were never very intimate. I liked the man and I think he liked me. But he was not very approachable; a self-contained, aloof, undemonstrative man, and an inveterate book-worm. But he was a good man and I respected him profoundly, though I could never understand why Barbara married him, or why he married Barbara. I couldn’t imagine him in love. On the other hand I cannot conceive any motive that any one could have had for doing him any harm. He seemed to me to be universally liked in a rather lukewarm fashion.”
