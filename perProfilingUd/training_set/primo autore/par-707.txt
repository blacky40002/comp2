He evidently did not recognize me--naturally, since my appearance was so much changed; but I recognized him instantly. He was “Mr. ----, her husband.” And his appearance was not improved since I had last seen him. Inspecting him from the front, I observed that he was sordidly shabby and none too clean, and that his large, rough boots were white with dust as if from a long tramp on the chalky Kentish roads.
