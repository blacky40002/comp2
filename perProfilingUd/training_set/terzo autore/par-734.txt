"There was Major Anderson,--he talked a great deal of you one night, after some one had mentioned wars, and that sort of thing,---and there was an old chap who argued about you with an old dame, the same evening. Really, your memory seemed to bulk large in their eyes." He paused, and smiled at his companions. "Oh, I forgot," he added; "there was a lady--very pretty, too--who stopped playing ping-pong with me to listen to what they were saying about Captain Hemming. Of course she didn't give that for a reason."
