The lieutenant looked both ashamed and sulky. He was handsome in a weak sort of way, with a baby face and a thread of black moustache. "We want not to kill," he began, in stilted English, then in his own tongue he continued, "We swore long ago to stick together and hold to our plans,--all except Captain Santosa. We are poor, and one way of making money seemed as good as another. We have our pride and our honour,--we officers. You insulted our colonel. You have called us robbers. Now we will humble your arrogance,--and get our pay."
