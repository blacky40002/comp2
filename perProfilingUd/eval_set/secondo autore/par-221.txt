Howe attended to his business inside and went back home frankly disturbed. It was clear enough that this group, while not actually hostile to Allston, looked forward with considerable pleasant anticipation to a second run-in between him and Bud. They intended to go even further--as far as it was possible by innuendo and goading they would spur Bud on. There was both amusement and excitement in the situation--just as in a cock or a dog fight. They were no more apt to consider consequences than Bud was--less, in view of the fact that they themselves were not in danger.
