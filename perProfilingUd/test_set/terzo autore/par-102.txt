He had a very good reason for wanting to be in that particular platoon, and there were men already in it who had no particular reason for remaining in it instead of going to some other platoon; so--as Sill very justly remarked to Dick, to Sacobie, to Sergt.

Scammell were the reasons he gave for wanting to be in that platoon.
