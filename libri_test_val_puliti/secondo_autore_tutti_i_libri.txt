CHAPTER I

BARNES--THE PREPOSTEROUS


If Barnes had been asked to define the one thing lacking in the scene
before him, he would probably have answered sentimentally, “A woman--a
young and very fair woman,” not that he had any definite figure in
mind, but simply because from an artist’s view point the picture,
wonderful as it was, seemed now like a marvelous setting without its
jewel.

A light breeze from the West, heavy with summer incense, wafted through
a golden-moted silence and across a turquoise sky with cotton-blossom
clouds. Dense, yet of gossamer fineness; massive, yet light as
thistledown, they took their course placidly without disturbing the
perfect serenity of their background. In their constant changing,
they appeared at times like Spanish galleons with every full-bellied
sail straining at its ropes. But they cut no churning path; they left
no oily wake. They only cast calm shadows which in their turn swept
majestically over the green valley below them. The heavy-leaved trees,
the fat grasses, the daisies and roadside ferns found themselves first
in the stark sunlight, then in the quiet shade, then in the brazen sun
again.

If Barnes had not been in tune with it all, he would have felt out of
place here on the top of the long hill up which he had just climbed by
the saffron road. As it was, he surveyed the scene with an air of easy
content. To a passer-by he might have given the impression of being a
large proprietor. In his heavy walking-boots, his belted trousers, his
flannel shirt gathered in at the throat with a light tie, his checked
English cap, and his walking-stick, he looked as though he might be
making a walking tour of his landed estates. He had a comfortable air
of princely sovereignty. His even features, his tall erect frame, his
gray-blue eyes, and above all his thin, straight nose carried out the
illusion. He had an air more of Bavaria than New England. But his firm
lips, surmounted by a bristling blonde mustache, trimmed short and in
a straight line, together with his Saxon hair, marked him of a hardier
race. He might have been a Dane, but his cheek bones were too high for
that, and there was too much good humor written large about the mouth.
As a matter of fact he was from New York state and his ancestors had
fought under Schuyler. His great grandfather was quoted as having said,
“I’d rather be killed as a private under Schuyler than live, a captain,
under Gates.” A sentiment his father had paraphrased when he raged at
the walking delegate who tried to unionize his shops, “I’ll go broke by
myself before I’ll get rich under you.” From that day Barnes, Sr., had
moved from one apartment house to another in New York city in a steady
crescendo of advancing rentals until now he needed a secretary to look
after the tipping alone. And “The Acme Manufacturing Co.” was wrought
in iron scrolls across the oven doors of half the cook-stoves in the
United States.

This fact, however, had less to do with Barnes to-day than the more
romantic one that his father in the days of beginnings, married his
book-keeper, a fine-souled English girl, niece of the late Lord
Dunnington. Her father, a younger son, came to America to make his
fortune, died soon after, and left the girl penniless. To-day the one
romantic spot left in Barnes, Sr., was his ambition to accumulate a
fortune so vast that it might overawe his caddish English relatives. It
was the mother in Barnes, Jr., and not the father who now stood upon
the top of the hills dreaming into the cotton-blossom clouds.

His pose was misleading. Barnes was proprietor of nothing but himself.
That was much or little as you happened to feel about it. To himself it
was enough to make him glad that he stood here to-day even with only a
trifle over ten round dollars to his name. The position was of his own
choosing. He might have been secretary to the Acme Manufacturing Co.
had he wished, instead of a painter of very good water-colors which as
yet, however, had not found so ready a market as the cook-stoves.

The father put it bluntly when he declared, “People must eat to live;
they can worry along without pictures.” Perhaps. But he couldn’t. He
could worry along better without cook-stoves, as he was proving.

But when a gay shaded patch of blue seen through the straggling
cloud-mist made him think of his mother’s wet eyes as they were when
in something of a temper he had quit the gorgeous apartment house
for good, it occurred to him that his father might have been less
irascible about the matter. The man had some grounds for temper to be
sure. In college Barnes had devoted himself to Fine Arts and similar
subjects when the elder, not recognizing the courses as expressed
in the University cipher code, had thought him working assiduously
at economics and other useful branches of manufacturing. Then, too,
instead of studying the market conditions of Europe when abroad, he
had used the opportunity for living a bit in the Latin quarter and
visiting the galleries. He reported home that so far as he could see,
people over there had to have pictures; they could worry along without
cook-stoves. But even so, he couldn’t stand being browbeaten like an
errant schoolboy, and therefore when matters came to a crisis he packed
up his sketch-book and started on a jaunt through the Catskills, where
Rip Van Winkle had found surcease before him.

Below him stretched acre after acre of farm lands made rich by three
generations of toilers. Gray stone walls told bluntly what the task
had been. They gave the scene a history such as crumbling castle walls
lend to English landscapes. The farms swept down a valley cut by a lazy
lowland stream, which looked as though it might furnish good trout
fishing. He turned to the left and saw through the birches bordering
the road what he had not before noticed--a red brick house half hidden
behind a row of elms. Just above, a wagon track led to it. He took a
position where he could see the house more in detail. He caught a
glimpse of a white-pillared porch and a Dutch door, the upper part
swung open. The brass handle shone brightly in the sunshine. To the
left there was a capacious barn with chickens scratching industriously
before the open door. From somewhere came the coppery tinkle of homing
cows. It looked like a place where for the asking one could get milk
and honey and good rye bread.

The rural free delivery carrier jogged up the hill and, stopping to
drop some mail in a letter-box out of sight behind the hedge, nodded
a cheery “Howdy” to Barnes and jogged on again. This man in his
officious Federal uniform destroyed something of the sleepy atmosphere
of the place. “Here I am,” he seemed to declare as boisterously as the
circular letters of the Acme Manufacturing Co. “Here I am, dear sir or
madame, and beg to remain most respectfully yours, the United States of
America.”

Barnes, who had opened his portfolio with an idea of sketching the
spot, closed it again, tying it in one of those hard knots which
invariably in the end he had to cut. But he was checked by a sound
from the direction of the letter-box. At first he thought it was a
distant whip-poor-will. It was low and had the same note of subdued
pathos. Then he concluded that it was a straggling brook running with
gentle sobbing among the ferns. But the peculiar sound soon became more
individualized. It took on a human note; then a feminine. Finally he
awoke to the fact that it was nothing else but the sobbing of a woman.
He strode up the grass-grown road to the hidden stretch beyond the
fringe of trees. There he found himself confronting a young woman who
was kneeling upon the grass, bowed above an open letter in her lap.

She was not over twenty, but tall and lithe. Her heavy hair, black and
silken, lay coiled about her head in heavy braids. She was dressed
in white with a collar of exquisite lace fastened at her throat with
a turquoise pendant. A great orange-colored cat arched its back in
apparent sympathy against her skirt. The soft grass had muffled his
approach so that for a moment she was unaware that she was not alone.

“I beg your pardon,” he apologized, hat in hand, now not at all sure
that he ought to be here.

She was upon her feet in an instant. She looked as though about to run.
The cat challenged him with a little spit.

“I didn’t know,” he hastened to explain, “but what you had met with an
accident.”

She looked whole enough. He surmised that the letter was the cause of
her agitation. If so, he certainly was intruding. Her black eyes, full,
Italian, swept by long lashes, seemed to tell him so.

“No,” she murmured, “it is nothing; just bad news. It came so
unexpectedly.”

Her lips moved rhythmically to the music of a sweetly lyrical voice.
Her teeth were as white as those of the orange-colored cat. She fitted
marvelously well into the scene above the valley. Consequently he
parried a little to prolong an interview to which he knew he had no
right.

“Luckily, bad news generally does come unexpectedly,” he said.

She flashed a look at him as though to fathom his intent. Then she
glanced swiftly towards the brick house and seemed instantly in her
grief to forget that he was there.

“It will kill him,” she exclaimed below her breath.

Still he hesitated, impressed by the weight of her sorrow.

“If I may be of any service,” he ventured, “I’m on my way to the next
village. Any letter or wire--”

She looked up.

“No! No! Such news travels only too quickly,” she answered. Her brows
contracted. She went on more to herself than to him, “If I could only
check it before it reaches him.”

“He,” mused Barnes, is at once the most personal and impersonal of
pronouns. Next to “She” it is the most pregnant with possibilities of
all human utterances.

He wondered, too, how it would be possible to paint a black that had
gold in it; an ivory that had rose in it; a pure white that had blue in
it. It was not possible. And yet there they were in her hair, her brow,
and the setting of her pupils. The tawny cat pressed close to her skirt.

“Then I fear,” he said half in apology, half in hope, as he prepared to
leave, “that I can’t help you. And yet,” he reflected aloud, “it seems
as though when ill fortune hits hard at anyone the rest of the world
ought to club in to help. There ought to be a bad news insurance.”

Her face brightened. But instantly it clouded again as she turned half
away.

“But instead of that,” he went on, “the world only raises barriers.”

She recognized his implied offer of help. If her instinct bade her
turn from it, there was something in his sturdy presence, above all
in his frank eyes, which made him seem to stand for just some such
kind-hearted insurance as he had whimsically suggested. It was
possible that he from his impersonal point of view might be able to see
more clearly than she just what in such a crisis as hers was wisest. At
any rate, she said,

“It’s about my brother. He won’t come home.”

Barnes suppressed a smile. He had been prepared for sudden death. He
shifted his eyes from her to the brick house now growing more mellow in
the softening twilight.

“That is his home?” he asked.

She nodded, watching him curiously.

“I should think a man ought to be eager to return to such a home as
that,” he said.

“He ran away,” she explained with some embarrassment at expressing the
more intimate details. “He is somewhere in Alaska.”

Barnes acknowledged her confidence with a sympathetic nod of his head.

“If he is in Alaska,” he suggested, “it will be only a matter of time.”

“That is just the trouble,” she exclaimed impulsively. “That is the
pity of it. It will be too late!”

He saw that the boy himself was a mere episode in some more poignant
grief. He waited for her to proceed. She said,

“I don’t know why I should tell you this--except that it’s a relief to
tell anyone. Father is up there waiting for him--with not long to live.
If he hears this--his heart--”

Her fingers closed convulsively over the letter.

“That _is_ tough,” he murmured. “Your father expected to see the boy
himself to-day?”

“Not to see him, but to hear him, to feel him. Father is blind.”

“That’s still worse. The boy knows of his trouble?”

She nodded.

“Then why won’t he come?”

“Because of a quarrel. He wrote this.”

She handed the letter to Barnes with a quick motion as though in sudden
hope that he might be able to gather from it something she herself had
missed. He glanced it through. It was a thoughtless letter. Its whole
tone was one of boyish bravado. Barnes flushed as he read it.

“What the boy seems to need,” he commented, “is a cowhiding.”

“I’m afraid he has fallen into bad company,” she apologized for him,
but none too heartily.

He checked his own opinion.

“Joe seems almost like a stranger to me,” she confided further. “He has
been gone five years now. And the last few years he _was_ at home, I
was away at school.”

Barnes refrained from congratulating her. He realized how really
serious an affair she had upon her hands.

“And you--you must tell your father this yourself?” he asked.

“Yes,” she answered, “and it’s like being ordered to kill him.”

She drew in a deep breath that was half a gasp.

Barnes thought a moment.

“The first thing I should do,” he advised, “would be to tear up the
letter.”

“You mean--?”

“I should never let him see that.”

She hesitated a moment and then still half dazed tore it into little
bits. She tossed the fragments to the ground. They were harried about
the greensward by a light sunset breeze. The yellow cat began to play
with them.

“Now,” he advised, “I shouldn’t tell your father anything.”

“But he expected Joe to-day! That would leave him to wait.”

“Isn’t that better?” he asked.

“Ah,” she exclaimed, “the blind wait so hard. There is nothing else for
them.”

“But they suffer hard, too. While waiting he could at least--hope.”

She shook her head quickly.

“He would guess.”

“A guess is never a certainty,” he persisted.

“It would be certainty enough to break down his poor heart. Dr.
Merriweather said that Joe alone could keep him with us another week.”

Barnes glanced again at the brick house. It scarcely seemed possible
that so grim a crisis as this could center there. The situation struck
home. In some way he felt the responsibility of this unknown young
man’s action resting upon his own shoulders. He, too, in a fit of anger
had left a father behind him.

At that moment Barnes was inspired by an idea--a preposterous idea to
be sure, but the present situation was preposterous and so was Barnes
himself if his father was to be believed. Furthermore most inspired
ideas _are_ preposterous. It depends a good deal on how they turn out
whether or not that adjective clings to them forever. But this one made
even Barnes catch his breath. He had to look again at the blue sky, at
the gold in her hair, at her eyes now misted like Loch Lomond at dawn.

“There is just one other course for us,” he announced deliberately. “We
might deceive him.”

She started back.

“I don’t understand.”

“How many up there must know of this?” he inquired.

“There is only Aunt Philomela,” she managed to answer.

“The servants?”

“They have heard of Joe but never seen him.”

“The neighborhood?”

“We moved here after Joe left.”

She answered his questions mechanically with no suspicion as to what he
was leading.

“The boy was young? You say this was five years ago?”

“Yes. Yes.”

“A lad changes a good deal in that time. Do I resemble him--even
remotely?”

“You?”

She studied him again as though for the first time she had seen him.

“Joe,” she faltered, “must be now--about your height.”

“That’s enough. A grown man may change in every way except in height.”

“But--”

“There is only a week or so. I am free. Why couldn’t I play the son?
Why,” he smiled at the odd whirligig, “why couldn’t I play the
prodigal?”

She started back, her hands clasped to her breast, her eyes grown big.

“How impossible!” she exclaimed.

“And humane,” he suggested.

The word caught her attention.

“It would be almost that,” she admitted reluctantly.

He waited. He did not care to press the point by argument. It was
merely a suggestion born of the moment--born of the acute necessity of
doing something at once. But she must decide for herself. He had done
his best, and however it turned this picture was worth remembering.

At first it did not seem to her even a possibility, but once she
recovered a little from the shock of her surprise, once she had
stripped it of its novelty, and, gazing into his honest eyes,
considered it merely as an heroic measure for easing the sick, blind
man to his end, she found herself forgetting everything else but the
peace it might bring. She, better than he, knew that it _was_ possible.

“But,” she exclaimed, “it is such a bit of trickery.”

“Nothing else,” he assured her, “or diplomacy if you wish to dignify
it.”

“If--if we succeeded it would make his last days very pleasant.”

“I would do my best.”

“But it is such an obligation--”

“Let me represent the world at its finest. Let me found the bad news
insurance company.”

“Surely you can’t afford to sacrifice so much time.”

“I’ll paint a picture or two. I shall be more than repaid.”

“You’re an artist!” she exclaimed as though that might account for many
hitherto inexplicable matters.

“I’m striving to deserve that title,” he admitted.

Her head was awhirl with the quick sequence of unexpected events. But
in the midst of it she still grasped at this hope.

“Would you,” she gasped, “be good enough to meet my aunt?”

“It will be a pleasure.”

“She is very quick-tempered,” she explained, “so you needn’t pay much
attention to her.”

“That is the distinct advantage of quick-tempered relatives,” he
affirmed.

“You will come now?”

“Yes,” he agreed readily. “And--it may be helpful--my name is Barnes.”

She shot a swift half-frightened smile at him. “And I am Miss Van
Patten.”

He bowed.

She led the way to the house, the yellow cat by her side.




CHAPTER II

THE COURTESY OF THE ROAD


The little old lady sitting by the window in the big living-room, as
serene as Whistler’s portrait of his mother, may have had a temper
but if so, thought Barnes as he entered at the girl’s heels, it was
concealed somewhere about her person other than in her face. She was
in black with a white cap sitting as daintily light on her gray hair
as the first flick of snow on a silver fir. She was a tiny body with
shrewd black eyes and a firm thin mouth. Her wrinkled cheeks still had
color. She was busy with a wisp of lace.

“Aunt Philomela, this is Mr. Barnes.”

The girl spoke the sentence as though it were one word. Aunt Philomela
snapped up her head and leveled her astonished black eyes upon a young
and decidedly good-looking stranger who was bowing low. Then she
shot them at the girl who had turned towards him she had so abruptly
introduced.

“I have been thrust so rather forcibly into the honor of your
acquaintance,” murmured Barnes, “in the hope that I may be of some
service.”

As he observed the lightning flashes beginning to cut the dark of her
eyes, Barnes suspected that she had already found in the hidden depths
of them, the missing temper. The formal courtliness of his introductory
speech baffled her for a moment, but now she observed in a sharp
staccato,

“Perhaps my niece will explain where she had the honor of meeting Mr.
Barnes.”

“By the hedge,” answered Barnes, assuming the burden of the reply,
“just by the letter-box.”

“And she is indebted--”

“To Chance and the courtesy of the road.”

“And the service you propose?” continued the little old lady, clearly
still bewildered. “A set of books, perhaps?”

It was evident that her wits were still keen.

“No,” answered Barnes, unruffled. He could blame his portfolio for that
accusation. “No, though it’s a matter requiring equal tact if that is
possible.”

The aunt, with a queenly nod of her white head towards a chair,
graciously gave him permission to be seated, though the red in her
cheeks was heightening ominously. Barnes surmising that she was
struggling hard not to sacrifice her present advantageous position to
a quick tongue, resolved to put the matter bluntly while yet there was
time.

“Your niece has just received a letter from your nephew. He writes that
he will not come home.”

“My niece confided this personal affair in you?”

He bowed.

“Eleanor,” she demanded, “is this true?”

“That Joe refuses to come home? It is brutally true, Aunt.”

The girl had turned her aunt’s hasty slur neatly. Barnes met her eyes
with understanding. As in Miss Van Patten’s case, the grim fact was
sufficient to divert the aunt’s attention from everything else.

“He refuses to come back at such a time?” she repeated. “This is
terrible!”

There was silence for a moment, and then she added,

“But this will break his heart!”

She glanced excitedly from one to the other of them. The girl crept to
her side.

“It will. It will if he learns of it. But he mustn’t.”

“Mustn’t, Eleanor? What other way is there?”

“Mr. Barnes--” began the girl.

The aunt glanced swiftly at the stranger again. He met her eyes
steadily--with perhaps the slightest, the very slightest, gallant
lowering of them in respectful deference to her age.

“I fail to see how a stranger may assist in so personal a matter,” she
observed icily.

“If you will let me explain,” said Barnes. “It seems to me that no one
but a stranger can help. I’ve ventured to suggest that I be allowed to
ward off the blow; that I be allowed to do this in the only possible
way now open--by impersonating the boy.”

The girl straightened herself and waited. Barnes put down his portfolio
and accepted the chair which had lately been offered him. Aunt
Philomela sat up as stiffly as though suddenly galvanized.

“You--you actually seriously propose such--such base trickery?” she
stammered.

“With the most honest intentions in the world,” nodded Barnes.

“You are bold and impertinent, sir!”

“Still with the best intentions in the world.”

“That does not excuse such knavery,” she protested.

The girl broke in,

“Aunt, if you’ll calm yourself and listen a moment. You are unkind to
one who has made so generous an offer--”

“Bah,” interrupted Aunt Philomela, “it is too generous.”

Barnes made no reply.

“I must ask Mr.--”

“Barnes,” he supplied as she hesitated.

“To withdraw at once.”

Barnes accepted the decision with equanimity. He reached for his
portfolio. But he was beginning to like this little old lady.

The girl checked him with a spirit that was authoritative.

“Would you be good enough to wait a moment,” she requested,
“until--until aunt goes upstairs and tells father?”

She turned to her aunt.

“Aunty,” she went on, “you must tell father that Joe refuses to come.
You must tell him that Joe is brutal about it. You may tell him that
there is no longer any need of his waiting.”

Aunt Philomela quailed.

“Where is the letter?” she demanded feebly.

“I tore it up. It wasn’t suitable for you to read.”

Barnes leaned forward towards the little form which had settled back
wearily into the chair. His eyes were tender and sympathetic but there
was nothing obtrusive in his attitude.

“Believe me,” he said gently, “I am sorry for you and would do what I
can. If what I proposed sounds absurd at first, you see that the only
other alternative is cruel. If we can make the end come peacefully and
quietly, won’t it justify us somewhat?”

“But why should you, a stranger--” Aunt Philomela began suspiciously.

“I don’t blame you for your doubts,” he answered. “But at such moments
as these, who are the strangers? I would help an old man who was
bruised by the roadside; why not an old man who lies bruised in his
bed?”

“Who are you?” she demanded.

Barnes smiled.

“Ask your cook. I’m the son of the Acme Manufacturing Co.”

The aunt for a moment doubted his sanity.

“Also,” he added, “I paint water-colors--some of them good, some of
them indifferent, all of them as well done as I know how to make them.”

“And you came here?” stammered Aunt Philomela, still confused.

“To escape New York. Also for a bit of walking trip to make sketches.
For what else--God knows. Perhaps for this.”

Aunt Philomela studied him shrewdly and in spite of herself his mouth
started a twinkle in her eyes.

“The whole idea,” she declared, “is absurd.”

“The whole situation,” he returned, “is pitiful.”

“Oh,” moaned Miss Van Patten, “it is. We have no right to stop at
anything which shall bring him relief.”

“We have no right to shirk our duty,” returned the aunt with conviction.

“Duty?” queried the girl. “Is it our duty to let father suffer?”

“It is our duty to bear our own burdens and not shift them upon
strangers.”

“I see no burden whatever in the undertaking,” corrected Barnes.

“Why don’t you?” challenged the aunt.

That _was_ a question. Why was he willing to leave the pleasant
freedom of the open road for a task which could not be called in
itself pleasurable? The question was even more involved than the
shrewd aunt suspected, when the fact was taken into account that he
was even willing to act the prodigal--a character for which he had a
particular aversion. To his mind the only decent way for the prodigal
to return was with the fatted calf over his own shoulders. He must
return triumphant, even if repentant. Otherwise it behooved him to stay
away in the far country he had chosen and take his medicine like a man.
To be sure the present case justified itself, but even so he did not
altogether like the flavor of it. Then why was this no burden? It was
clearly simply a case of atmosphere. The house itself had something
to do with it, the gold in the girl’s hair had something, so did the
little old aunt herself with the pink in her crinkly cheeks. He turned
from the aunt to the niece. Decidedly, he thought, she should be
painted on ivory.

“Why don’t you?” repeated the aunt, pressing home her point.

He glanced out of the window. The West was donning her jewels; pearl,
opal, and amethyst.

“Because,” he answered, “the day is very fair.”

“We are indebted then to the sun?”

He avoided the obvious pun and nodded.

“To the sun, the month, the time of day, and--a slight matter of
temperament.”

The girl lifted her eyes to his with a smile. The aunt did not repeat
again her salient question; instead she frowned.

“I have my two eyes,” she answered enigmatically.

“The world is your debtor,” murmured Barnes, chivalrously.

“Aunty, you ought to think of nothing but father,” broke in the girl.
“He will soon wake up in the dark with the old question on his lips.”

There came to them even then the silvery tinkle of a bell from
upstairs.

“Oh, dear,” gasped Aunt Philomela.

Her niece stood squarely before her.

“There’s no more time for argument,” she said. “We must decide now at
once. Either we must accept Mr. Barnes’ offer or--you must go up to
father.”

“Oh, dear,” gasped Aunt Philomela.

“Are you going to him, Aunt?” demanded the girl.

“Oh, dear no,” she trembled. “It quite puts me out of breath to think
of it.”

“Then--?”

“Do you think it possible that he can be deceived like this?” she asked.

Barnes arose.

“We can only try. It looks in our favor.”

There was a pause.

“Then?” inquired Barnes, directly.

“Go,” she replied. “Go quickly.”

Which, though ambiguous, decided the matter. Barnes left the room,
following the girl who, quite as out of breath as her aunt, led the
way.




CHAPTER III

DREAMS OF THE OLD


They had no sooner reached the head of the stairs than a second tinkle
came rippling fairy-like the length of the white-finished hall from
a room at the end facing the West. Miss Van Patten paused. But the
orange-colored cat preceded them and stepped daintily over the sill.

“Shall we follow her Highness?” whispered Barnes.

The girl shrank back a little.

“If we fail?” she gasped.

“Then,” answered Barnes, “there’ll be nothing left but to explain.”

“Would he ever forgive us? Would he ever trust us again?”

“That comes later,” he reminded her. “We haven’t failed yet.”

“So much depends upon you!”

“Much more depends upon him. If his hunger for the boy is great enough,
he will forget everything but the fact that he has at last something
tangible--something to grasp.”

Again her eyes grew big as she studied him with the feeling that not
until this very moment had she ever seen him before. Here in the
intimacy of the upper chambers the boldness of the act oppressed her.
Before, it had seemed only a theory, but now it became an actuality. He
himself felt it. It would have taken little to have turned him back.
But at this moment the orange-colored cat returned for them. Then the
father called. Time was pressing. She took the lead but Barnes with a
quicker pace stepped ahead of her.

At the door, he paused. He saw a large room bathed in the glow of the
setting sun. In one corner stood a large four-posted bed. The white
counterpane stood out like a snow-sheeted pool among evergreens.
Bolstered up with fat pillows he saw a face that would have served
for a model of a saint’s. He had but a second to study it and make
his decision, but that was time enough. It was a child’s face grown
old. White-bearded though it was, it was still a child’s face. All
the man-fret was smoothed out of it, all the world marks rubbed away.
He seemed more like a son lying there than a father. His eyes were
closed and one thin arm lay outside the clothes by his side. His face
was turned towards the door. The cat leaped upon the counterpane and
instantly the father raised his head.

“Eleanor?” he called.

Barnes strode to his side as the cry escaped. He placed a strong hand
upon the thin arm. The eyes though they remained closed seemed to
strain in that direction. The lips moved.

“My son!” he trembled.

Barnes bowed his head. That was a cry to go to a man’s heart. He could
not answer it. He felt the gentle fingers play up his arm to his hair.
He felt them flutter over his forehead, his cheeks, his chin. Then,
kneeling, he waited for the second cry. It came charged with such
feeling as to bring a strain to his throat.

“My son!”

There was no doubt in it. It was a wild, glad, embracing sob. It was
the utterance of an empty heart suddenly filled. He was breathing
rapidly from the excitement, but he freed his other hand and with the
two clung almost fiercely to the boy’s arm.

“You’ve come back,” he whispered.

“Yes,” answered Barnes, finding his voice, “I’ve come back.”

The voice for a second seemed to startle the old man. His hold relaxed.
The girl who had crept to the other side of him raised her head with
her eyes fixed on Barnes, scarcely breathing. The old man’s eyelids
fluttered as though he were straining to force them open.

“I’ve come back,” repeated Barnes.

“I can feel you, but your voice--Oh, it’s enough now that I can feel
you! I’ve often heard your voice, lying here but--but my hands were
always empty.”

The girl breathed again. Barnes met her eyes. He nodded encouragement.
It was as he had thought; the fact of a living tangible presence here
was enough to dispel all minor doubts.

“You’ve been gone so long,” faltered the father, “I--I had forgotten. I
expected to see you as you were when you left.”

“I was a boy when I left,” answered Barnes.

“Yes, yes, and I was not boy enough. You--you forgive, Joe?”

“It is for you to forgive, father.”

“Your voice has grown kinder. Eleanor--you are my eyes. Help me to see
him as he is to-day. He is taller?”

“Yes,” she answered.

“He is tanned?”

“Yes, Daddy.”

“I can see him! I can see him! He has grown handsome, my boy, eh?”

She met Barnes’ eyes steadily.

“Yes,” she answered, “I think you could say that.”

“Where is Philomela?” he demanded suddenly. “She should be here to see
my boy.”

“She is downstairs, Daddy. She--she was a bit overcome.”

“What wonder? This goes to one’s head.”

He lay back upon the pillows, his breath coming brokenly. Barnes feared
for him.

“I must not stay long, father,” he ventured. “You must rest a little.
I’ll come up later.”

He felt the sudden grip of Van Patten’s fingers upon his arm.

“There is so much for you to tell. I’ve lost five years out of your
life.”

“There are all the days to come.”

“There must be many--many to make up for the days that have gone.”

“I will try to bring back those days to you.”

“You are glad to be home again, eh?”

“Yes,” Barnes answered truthfully. “You make me glad to be here.”

“There are so many things,” he faltered. “But your aunt must see you.
She is not as strong as I am. I--I am afraid she is failing a little.”

“You will rest now?”

“Yes, I can rest now. Boy, you have brought _me_ home.”

Barnes pressed the feeble hand and rose.

“Shall I send John to you?” asked the daughter. “Do you need anything?”

“Nothing more,” he answered, as he sank back wearily among the pillows.
He looked like a man who had come to the end of a long journey.

Barnes started out.

“You’ll be downstairs? You’ll be where I can call you?”

“Yes,” answered Barnes.

The girl stopped and kissed her father’s thin lips. He reached up his
hand and smoothed her hair a moment. Then his arm fell and he seemed to
sleep, dropping off quickly as a child does.

Aunt Philomela had not moved. When the two came in again, she glanced
up swiftly.

“Well?” she asked eagerly.

“Yes,” answered Barnes. “It is well.”

“Then you were successful in your deception?”

Miss Van Patten crossed to her aunt’s side and kissed her gray hair.
She kept her face hidden there for a moment.

“Aunt! Aunt!” she choked. “If you could have seen!”

Between anger, shame, and relief Aunt Philomela’s lips trembled. But
she answered sharply,

“Thank the Lord I was saved from all active participation.”

“If you could have heard his glad cry!”

“I should have been ashamed.”

But in spite of her answer the corners of her mouth grew less tense and
the little patches of rose upon her cheeks returned again. Barnes felt
glad of that. With her spirit up, she seemed less formidable.

“He accepted you without suspicion?” she inquired of Barnes as though
she could not yet believe it.

“In such blind heart-hunger as his,” he answered, “there is little room
for suspicion.”

“Truly,” she answered tartly, “my brother must be quite blind.”

As a relief from the tension of the last few minutes, Aunt Philomela’s
sharp tongue came as a relish to Barnes. He had never in his life
passed a more uncomfortable quarter of an hour.

“There are worse things in the world than blindness,” he suggested.

Miss Van Patten raised her head.

“I was afraid--almost afraid that father’s eyes would open and he would
see again.”

“Only a guilty conscience could inspire such a fear,” snapped Aunt
Philomela.

“Don’t you want to have him happy?” challenged her niece. “He is
sleeping now--the first time for two days.”

“He is sleeping?”

“We used to give him powders to make him sleep and forget. Isn’t this a
better way?”

“Sleeping powders, my dear, do not operate upon the whole family!”

Barnes smiled.

“Am I so dull?” he asked.

“I was referring to their dream properties rather than their
soporific,” Aunt Philomela answered with some magnanimity and yet with
suspicious point, too.

“There is a distinction between dreaming and sleeping,” he admitted.

“A clear distinction.”

“It might mark all the difference between a poet and a bore.”

“There is little harm in bores,” declared Aunt Philomela.

“You flatter me.”

“You have drawn a wrong deduction.”

“Then you flatter me still more. I had never thought of myself as a
poet. However, if you fear the dreams--an old man’s dreams--it is not
too late to withdraw.”

“I should call it a great deal too late.”

“No,” he answered decidedly. “I’ll frame some sort of an excuse for
returning to Alaska to-morrow. It may be a bit clumsy but I can make it
answer.”

“You’re an adept at that sort of thing.”

“It is for you to decide what we shall do,” he insisted.

The little old lady hesitated. She disliked very much being cornered in
such fashion. But Barnes had caught the worry in the girl’s eyes and
realized the necessity of having this settled at once.

“It is already decided,” she fenced.

“Only as far as this. He has his dreams for to-day. That is something.
To-morrow is not decided.”

Miss Van Patten started. Barnes waited relentlessly.

“I--I don’t know,” faltered Aunt Philomela.

Still he waited. Miss Van Patten started to interpose but he checked
her with a glance. The silence grew oppressive.

“You have no right,” squirmed Aunt Philomela.

“Exactly,” he interposed. “You alone have the right.”

“Then,” she snapped. “I suppose we must.”

“I think it’s the only way,” he agreed quietly.

Miss Van Patten embraced her aunt excitedly.

“I knew you’d approve,” she cried.

“Upon compulsion,” interjected Aunt Philomela.

“No,” warned Barnes, “I refuse to have it so.”

“Of circumstances,” added the aunt quickly.

“Which prompt us to every act,” threw in Barnes.

“Wise and unwise,” commented the aunt grimly.

Barnes allowed the matter to drop leaving Aunt Philomela with the last
word which she accepted in an unmistakable spirit of victory.

The girl was all activity at once.

“We must show Mr. Barnes to Joe’s room and then supper will be ready,”
she exclaimed.

As she met her aunt’s eyes she blushed with pretty embarrassment but
she immediately tripped out of the room and soon returned with John.

“John,” she ordered. “You will make Mr. Joe’s room ready at once. You
will follow him?” she asked, turning to Barnes.

It was neatly done. With a bow to Aunt Philomela, Barnes made his exit.

The room to which he was led had been prepared for weeks. It faced the
East. It was large and was furnished with a huge black walnut bed,
a cool matting of green, a great high-boy with brass handles, and a
bureau with drawers two feet deep. White dimity curtains fluttered
at the windows. But for the moment John interested him more than the
homely furnishings.

John was as stoical as an English butler. He was short, stout, and
of that non-committal middle age which ranges between twenty-five and
forty. He met one’s eyes with a sort of timid stare and a suggestion
that he knew and he would tell. There was a nodding mystery about
him. He made Barnes feel like searching the room to see what it was
that the man silently hinted might be concealed. John was a piquer of
curiosity--a caballer with the unknown.

“John,” suggested Barnes after the man had thrown back the spread,
shown him his bath, and glanced about significantly for his baggage.
“John, I think you’d better look under the bed.”

John obeyed and stared so long into a dark corner there, that Barnes
took a position on his knees beside him.

“Did you see anything move?” he inquired.

“Move? Where, sir?” John gasped.

“Over there. A sort of--Thing.”

“Good Lord, sir!”

“I may have been mistaken,” Barnes admitted, “but perhaps we’d better
examine the closets.”

John crossed the room with some hesitation and with many backward
glances. He opened the closet door the matter of a foot and peered in.
Barnes coughed. John darted back.

“Anything there, John?”

“What--what did you expect, sir?”

“A sort of--Thing.”

“No, sir,” answered John eagerly and with conviction, moving deeper
into the room. “There’s nothing of that sort there, sir.”

“You see,” explained Barnes. “I’ve just come from the frozen North.
There are many strange things there--very strange things.”

“Yes, sir.”

“You may go.”

John accepted his dismissal with alacrity.

“If there are to be mysteries here,” commented Barnes to himself. “We
may as well have them picturesque.”




CHAPTER IV

QUESTIONS OF DIPLOMACY


At the round table covered with sun-bleached napery and silver that
caught the candle light until it seemed ablaze, Aunt Philomela, with
a diplomacy equaled only by that of King Arthur, had so arranged
the places that no one could tell who sat opposite who. She herself
presided at the quaint old silver tea urn, so that naturally marked
the head of the board. But Barnes and Miss Van Patten were placed
equi-distant from her on either side so that they did not face one
another.

On the table were damson preserves, a clear crimson as of molten
rubies; milk-white bread; a bowl of crisp salad fresh from the garden;
and a pitcher of milk so heavy with cream that it poured the lightest
possible shade of coffee-color.

Aunt Philomela had freshened herself in a purple gown relieved
by spider thread lace. Her niece was in a gossamer white China
silk sprinkled with blue polka dots. In her black hair she wore a
tortoise-shell comb surmounted with old gold scroll of the finest
Venetian workmanship. It was just the touch needed to bring out the
Italian richness of her features. She might now have been presiding
at some old Patrician board with the chanties of the gondoliers
floating in at the open windows, except for Aunt Philomela, stern as
a Puritan conscience--and the damson preserves. On the whole Barnes
liked her better in her present setting. To them all came the song of
a whip-poor-will mourning to his mate beneath the purple sky in the
orchard just outside.

“How will you have your tea?” asked Aunt Philomela.

“With cream, Aunt Philomela, no sugar if you please.”

Miss Van Patten held her breath. Aunt Philomela sat fixed with the
tongs poised over the square sugar bowl.

“Such audacity!” she choked.

“I was only speaking my line,” he hastened to explain. “The servants,
you know.”

“I think it quite necessary,” put in the girl, hastily bringing up
reënforcements at the sight of her aunt’s snapping eyes.

“It will take me some time to get used to it,” added Barnes. “You see I
haven’t the good fortune to have a real aunt.”

“It is an unpardonable liberty,” protested Aunt Philomela,
unreasonably.

“And you must call me Joe,” he hurried on, “and I must address your
niece as Eleanor.”

Barnes himself was a little breathless after that. He found himself
studying the damson preserves. Had he looked up he would have found
them a good match for Miss Van Patten’s cheeks.

“I see no help for it,” agreed the latter.

“Eleanor,” trembled the aunt.

“Well, is there?” she demanded. “How else can he address me before the
servants?”

“He can at least refrain, when the servants are _not_ in the room.”

She dropped two lumps of sugar into Barnes’ cup.

“If you please,” murmured Barnes, “no sugar, Aunt Philomela.”

Aunt Philomela corrected her mistake by adding another lump. Barnes
accepted it with a murmur of thanks.

“You see,” he continued more at ease, “John already has his suspicions.”

“He has?” exclaimed the aunt uneasily. “But he has never seen Joe! He
has been with us only since we came here.”

“All I know,” Barnes answered, “is that John looked under the bed and
in the closets before he left me.”

The aunt did not disclose the fact that this was one of John’s nightly
duties in the modest room she occupied next to her niece’s, but the
latter’s eyes warmed into a smile.

“Perhaps that was mere force of habit,” hinted Miss Van Patten.

Aunt Philomela turned a warning glance upon her niece--her cheeks
coloring daintily.

“It made me realize that I ought to know more about myself,” Barnes
continued.

“You were precious little good,” vouchsafed the aunt.

“Must I act up to my reputation?” he asked solicitously.

Miss Van Patten put in kindly,

“I think you will have no difficulty in living up to the Joe my father
found to-day.”

“I think it wise to idealize the boy as far as possible,” he said.

Miss Van Patten served him with salad and a portion of the damson
preserves.

“But there are certain details,” he persisted.

“If you’re going to idealize Joe, you’d better leave out the details,”
advised Aunt Philomela.

“I referred more particularly to the historical details,” he answered.
“There is for instance the question of my age.”

“You will be twenty-three next October,” Aunt Philomela condescended to
inform him.

“Thank you. Then I suppose I ought to know the ages of--my relatives.”

“Which matches well with your other presumptions,” answered the aunt
with heat.

But here Miss Van Patten took the matter into her own hands and
sketched for him as delicately as possible the brief career of this
only son. She told first a little something of the mother who had been
dead ten years now and of the blow this was to the father. Mr. Van
Patten had practically retired, when this occurred, from the bank where
he had for so long been president. For a few years they lived on in
New York, with Aunt Philomela, her mother’s sister, filling the gap as
best she could. Joe even as a child had been hard to handle and when
he grew up became very willful. He did not like school and so Mr. Van
Patten, when the boy was sixteen, found a position for him in the bank.
But he was restless there and did not stay long. He tried one thing
after another without success and finally when rebuked by his father,
left home altogether. During these years she herself had been away at
school and so had seen little of her brother. After the boy left, her
father broke down and upon the advice of the doctors came back here
in the hills. They had been here now five years living very much
to themselves. From time to time they had heard from the boy in his
wanderings, locating him a few months ago in Alaska.

It was an undramatic narrative and yet as it fell from her lips Barnes
listened with keen absorption. Or was it merely to the melody of her
voice? After she had ceased, he found himself still listening.

“May I serve you to more tea?” interrupted Aunt Philomela.

Barnes thoughtfully stirred the thick syrup in his cup.

“I think not, thank you,” he answered.

“So you see,” added Miss Van Patten, “there is not very much for you to
learn.”

“No,” he smiled, “I’m not so black as I was painted. But there are
still some other things I must post myself on. I would like--”

“I positively refuse to surrender my private papers,” objected Aunt
Philomela.

“An atlas,” Barnes finished.

“An atlas!” gasped Aunt Philomela, taken by surprise.

“An atlas. I must study my geography. The most I know of Alaska at
present is that it’s the home of polar bears. Are you familiar with the
habits of polar bears, Aunt Philomela?”

The girl smiled. That was what Barnes had wished.

“No. I fear I can’t assist you in that fabrication,” Aunt Philomela
answered curtly.

“There is a bear in the park,” he informed her. “I’ve often watched
him. Upon that subject at least I may speak with some authority. But
there are many other things in Alaska. Eskimos, for instance. I’m
a little weak on Eskimos. In the pictures they look much like the
bears except that they carry harpoons. There are also the details of
mining--have you ever been interested in mines?”

“Yes,” scowled Aunt Philomela. “In a weak moment Joe persuaded me by
letter.”

Clearly that was a delicate subject. He swerved away from it.

“I must post myself on names. I recall only Nome, White Horse, and
Dawson.”

The girl smiled again.

“That _is_ a complication,” she exclaimed. “Father is sure to question
you. He is interested in travel.”

“I’ll do my best to instruct him.”

“I don’t think you’re justified in imposing upon a helpless old man,”
declared Aunt Philomela, severely.

“My dear aunt,” returned Barnes, amiably, “all of us stay-at-homes are
imposed upon by our traveling brothers. I have a friend who has been
to India whom I have often confuted with the aid of an encyclopedia.
Unless I’m mistaken, my stories will compare favorably with any Joe
himself might tell.”

“They couldn’t be much more untruthful,” the aunt admitted, thinking of
her mine.

“That gives me a pleasant margin.”

“Of one fact I can assure you,” she further volunteered, “gold does
_not_ lie around the hills in chunks--at least not in the vicinity of
‘The Lucky Find.’”

“I’ll make a note of that.”

“Which I hope will prove more valuable than my nephew’s notes.”

John stole in at the door.

“He is calling for Mr. Van Patten, Miss Schuyler.”

Schuyler? Barnes received a pleasant surprise at the name. His
ancestors had fought under Schuyler and now fortune had decreed that he
himself should enter an engagement with one of that hero’s descendants.

Aunt Philomela glanced towards Barnes with something like reliance.

“Very well, John,” he answered, “I’ll be right up.”

He turned to his hostess.

“May I hope that the ladies will not have retired before I return?”

“You may be assured of that fact,” answered Aunt Philomela with
decision.

He had no sooner left the room than she confronted her niece.

“Well?” she demanded, indicating clearly that she still held the girl
accountable for the whole situation.

Miss Van Patten lowered her eyes.

“You make it very hard,” she murmured.

“I?” snorted the aunt. “What have I to do with it? I wash my hands of
the whole affair.”

“You can’t do that,” she exclaimed, “after you asked him to remain!”

“I asked him to remain? I? When that great tall man stood over me--”

In her indignation she could go no further.

“Why he wouldn’t hurt you. He wouldn’t hurt--anything.”

“What do you know about him?”

“Can’t you _see_?”

“Yes,” answered the aunt, “I can see.”

“One need only look at his eyes.”

She stopped. Her aunt had a most embarrassing way at times.

“I suppose he means well enough,” admitted the aunt more kindly.

“How can he mean anything else? What has he to gain by giving his time
to us?”

“It is not easy to understand men--especially young men,” affirmed Aunt
Philomela.

“There isn’t anything to understand, when one is just kind.”

“A great deal more sometimes than when one is merely unkind.”

Miss Van Patten met her aunt’s eyes.

“Aunt,” she declared, “if you could have seen the joy in Daddy’s face
you wouldn’t bother yourself with suspicions. We haven’t any right to
consider ourselves at all in this matter. We’ve saved father a great
grief. Isn’t that enough?”

The aunt shook her head slowly.

“My dear,” she answered, “you’ve been swept on by your emotions. You
don’t realize the seriousness of what we’ve done. We’ve taken into the
intimacy of our family a stranger--a young stranger, about whom we know
nothing. Supposing any of our relatives should swoop down on us from
New York? What would they say? What will our friends about here say?
What will Dr. Merriweather say?”

The girl answered quietly,

“What does all that matter when you think of what we’ve saved Daddy?”

“Matter? It would mean nothing short of a scandal.”

Miss Van Patten flushed. But she answered still quietly,

“I think you’re mistaken, Aunty. But even that--what would that matter?”

“Bah. You aren’t out of your swaddling-clothes as far as the world
goes.”

The girl crept closer to her aunt. She placed her hand upon the thin
shoulder.

“Aunty dear, if you found an old man bruised by the road, would you
hesitate? Do we need a stranger to show us how just to be kind? That
isn’t the way you’ve helped the poor with Dr. Merriweather.”

Aunt Philomela looked steadily into the young girl’s face.

“My dear,” she answered, “I’m seventy-two and you’re twenty-two.”

“Must I wait until I am your age before I’m human?”

“Perhaps--before you learn that you _are_ human.”

Then the aunt asked an apparently irrelevant question,

“Is Carl coming over to practice with you to-night?”

Miss Van Patten turned away.

“I haven’t been thinking of Carl.”

“How are you going to introduce him to this stranger?”

Miss Van Patten did not answer.

“You see,” observed Aunt Philomela as she rose from the table, “there
are more complications here than you think of.”

The two made their way into the sitting-room. The aunt took a chair
near the window. Miss Van Patten remained standing, looking out into
the dark.

“I shall send a note to Carl telling him I’m engaged for this evening,”
she concluded. She gave the letter to John and then returned. Aunt
Philomela remained staring at the door. It was a full half hour before
Barnes came down.

“Alaska,” he announced, sinking into a chair in the ark, “Alaska is
said to be a cold country, but at times it gets most uncomfortably hot
there.”




CHAPTER V

THREE-FINGERED BILL


Barnes noted that Miss Van Patten had a personality which asserted
itself even in the dark. Though he could see nothing of her more than
an outline, he was able to follow every expression. This made it easier
to understand how the blind father gave himself up completely to that
other illusion.

“Will you ring for a light, Eleanor?” requested Aunt Philomela.

“The dark is very restful,” hazarded Barnes.

He rather enjoyed the situation. It gave his imagination freer play.

“The dark may keep us all in better countenance,” assented the aunt
tartly.

“You left him happy? He suspected nothing?” inquired Miss Van Patten,
eagerly.

“I left him asleep,” answered Barnes.

“Oh, that’s good. He hasn’t slept at night.”

“He has worried a great deal?”

“It’s been enough to break one’s heart to hear him call for Joe night
after night in the dark.”

“If ever I meet the boy,” observed Barnes with impressive
deliberateness, “I shall try to make him live for himself the hour I’ve
just lived for him. I listened to a saint, feeling like the Devil.”

“I don’t understand how Joe had the heart to hurt him,” choked the girl.

“He didn’t _have_ the heart--that’s the trouble,” answered Barnes. “No
one in the world will venture so far to give us pain as our own.”

Aunt Philomela stirred uneasily.

“For sheer mercilessness,” added Barnes, “give me a relative. It made
me squirm to have to save the boy from the shame he deserves.”

“How can we ever thank you for this!” exclaimed Miss Van Patten.

“By letting me stand face to face with the boy sometime.”

Aunt Philomela broke in.

“This act is not like Joe. He was never brutal. I don’t think he
understood.”

“No. He probably didn’t understand. That’s the brutal part of it. It’s
the brutes who don’t understand.”

He spoke with some heat--more than he intended, but he was still fresh
from that interview. The old man’s grip was still on his arm; those
sightless eyes were still straining into his. He still heard the
irregular breathing and the panting questions--childish questions,
trivial questions made great by the love back of them. And to these
he had been forced to give lying answers which would never have been
accepted save for this same great love and trust. He needed now to
be diverted from the memory of it. He was eager to stir up Aunt
Philomela--to turn to the lighter side of it though even the comedy of
it was tragical.

“If we’re going to be consistent travelers, Aunt Philomela,” he began,
“it will be necessary for me to repeat my story to you.”

“Is travelers the word?” she snapped back.

“The more polite word at any rate,” answered Barnes.

“I believe in calling a spade a spade.”

“But that isn’t any reason for calling everything a spade,” he ventured
to suggest. “What I was forced to tell him didn’t have sufficient truth
in it to make it a lie. It was pure fiction. I am sorry I didn’t have
more time for preparation. My effort was necessarily in the nature
of an inspiration. It was crude. It made me sorry that when a boy I
neglected physical geography.”

Aunt Philomela groaned.

“I’m sure you did the best you could,” declared Miss Van Patten. “It
was a very awkward position for you.”

“It was to say the least humiliating. He asked a great many questions.”

“Poor Daddy.”

“He will probably ask still more of Aunt Philomela,” he remarked.

“If he does!” she exploded.

“If he does?” he inquired.

“Why--this is disgraceful! We’re getting in deeper and deeper.”

“And he?”

Aunt Philomela did not answer.

“Well,” Barnes finished, “we will hold him high out of the water as
long as we can. Shall I repeat to you what I told him?”

“Yes, yes,” broke in the girl, “our stories must agree.”

“The best I could do was to paint a picture,” he half apologized.

“Picture making is your profession, I believe?” questioned Aunt
Philomela.

“Yes,” he answered slowly. “But _my_ public has eyes. There are some
advantages in painting for the blind. But, for that matter, many
supposedly good eyes _are_ blind.”

“And many supposedly weak ones are sound.”

“Exactly. The soul is the vision. I remembered the heading of the boy’s
letter--‘The Last Chance’--and so had a starting-point. Given, too,
the mystical white name ‘Alaska’ and what setting ought we to furnish
a penniless young man with more spirit than heart? It was only a guess
but I chose this: a green-blue sky, brittle, stinging; a panorama of
white undulating to a horizon shrouded in virgin snow; in the middle
distance a few slab huts; in the foreground a closer huddling of camps
with the gaudy sign of the ‘Nugget’ saloon conspicuous. In the single
street, bearded men as ungainly as bears in their heavy clothing,
glancing with fevered eyes now towards the ‘Nugget,’ now towards the
rugged banker mountains. Lean mongrels attached to sleds, passing from
time to time, but no other animals; no birds, no felines, no wasted
brute life.”

The Princess stole across the room and sprang into the girl’s lap. She
passed her hand over the silken hair.

“The notable other buildings,” continued Barnes, dreamily, “are
the post-office, the bank, the assayer’s offices, all of which
are distinguished by their signs. In the bank the sheriff has
diplomatically taken up quarters. So much for the stage.

“In a shanty on the outskirts of the settlement, sits Joe--sits myself.
I am in heavy trousers tucked into cowhide boots and wear a bearskin
coat. I am studying a batch of papers. They are the giddily-printed
stock certificates of ‘The Lucky Find.’”

“I know them,” nodded Aunt Philomela, now quite lost in the narrative.

“I’m indebted to you for that suggestion,” answered Barnes. “I pore
over the papers for a minute and then go to a corner where there’s
a stout wooden chest marked ‘Joe Van Patten, His box,’ I take out a
package of letters from home. I place them on the table and my eyes
grow moist.”

“I never saw the boy blubber in my life,” objected Aunt Philomela.

“You mustn’t interrupt,” protested Miss Van Patten.

“While I’m thus sentimentalizing,” Barnes hurried on,
“enter--three-fingered Bill.”

“Bah,” interrupted the aunt again.

“The name isn’t mine,” he explained, “I stole it from a magazine story.
Besides, Bill was falsely so called--they neglected to count his thumb.
Bill is a rough dog with whiskers like an anarchist but with a kindly
heart beating beneath his faded pink sweater. This was a relic of the
days when he served as a rubber down at prize fights.”

“A pleasant companion,” snorted Aunt Philomela.

“A useful one, at any rate. He greets me with a cheery ‘Hello, pard,
back in the home camp?’ I guiltily thrust the packet aside and we come
down to business on how most advantageously to use our relatives in the
matter of the gorgeous stock certificates.”

“So Bill was responsible for that!” exclaimed the aunt.

“Responsible?”

“For disposing of that worthless paper.”

She checked herself quickly.

“I hope,” she added, “that you didn’t hint to Mr. Van Patten what I
inadvertently let drop about ‘The Lucky Find.’”

“I was very cautious about particularizing in any matter capable of
substantiation.”

“I wouldn’t for the world have him know. The loss--er the loss was
slight.”

Barnes felt his heart warm towards Aunt Philomela. It would have warmed
still more had he known that this investment involved half her scant
property.

“I mentioned the fact that Bill with his wider experience held out
very bright prospects for the mine.”

“It was thoughtful of you to lay it to Bill.”

Mr. Van Patten instantly offered to assist me to the limits of his
means.

“If you dare allow him to invest--”

“I haven’t even any gilded certificates,” he reminded her.

“Of course not. I forgot.”

“This is merely a picture. As you see picture making can be the most
harmless of occupations. We artists produce the effect, without the
danger; we present the rose, without the thorns; we develop our mines,
without certificates. I assured Mr. Van Patten that this was no time to
invest.”

“You did very well,” Aunt Philomela complimented him.

“Thank you. Following this I went into the details of the cold weather,
but--you know all about that. I assured him that I was warm and that I
had plenty to eat.”

“Daddy hasn’t been able to take food at all without wondering if Joe
were hungry.”

“I was well supplied, I assure you. He wished to know more about my
friends and so I introduced him to Sam Foss, a most likeable fellow;
Ranston, an old college friend of mine out there somewhere; and Bart
Stanton, a Massachusetts Technology graduate. So you see my friends
averaged up pretty well.”

“They certainly were an improvement on one fingered Bill.”

“_Three_ fingered Bill,” he corrected, “you must be careful of your
details.”

“I shall venture to repeat nothing,” she asserted. “And you think he
believed all that nonsense?”

“As an eager child believes.”

“I suppose,” she mused sadly, “he _has_ become a bit childlike.”

“He was a child when listening,” Barnes continued, “but when he talked
to me it was the father who talked. I’m sorry the real child who wrote
the childish letter didn’t hear what he said to me.”

He paused. Aunt Philomela waited expectantly and so, too, did her
niece. But he told them nothing more. That which was not part of the
dream--that which was sober reality, he had no heart to repeat.

“That concludes my report,” he said as the silence remained unbroken.

Again a silence. Then Miss Van Patten spoke.

“You’ve been most kind to us. It’s hard to know how to thank you.”

“It isn’t necessary. I’ve been well repaid--if that were essential.”

Somewhere about the house an old clock chimed nine.

Aunt Philomela rose.

“We retire early in the country,” she said wearily, “I’ll call John.”

“Thank you. I trust your dreams will be pleasant.”

“They will be of Alaska. I feel it in my bones.”

“They might be worse located--on a summer evening,” he hazarded.

She swept like a royal dowager towards the door. The girl followed but
stopped a moment before him.

“Thank you again,” she murmured. “Good night.”

Then, with the Princess close behind her, she too swept queen like from
the room.

As with something of a sigh Barnes half turned, he found John beside
him as though he had come up through a trap in the floor.

“Ah, you?” he exclaimed.

“Yes, sir,” faltered John, wondering what else his master’s son had
expected, “will you follow me, sir?”

Lighting a candle, the man escorted him to the room where the dimity
curtains were bulging in from a brisk night breeze. As he placed the
flickering light upon the dresser, Barnes inquired,

“You haven’t seen--”

“Good Lord, sir. No, sir.”

“Very well, John. You may go.”

He went, leaving Barnes to the fragrance of the night. The dark of the
orchard made him think of her hair.




CHAPTER VI

THE MYSTERY OF A VISION


Barnes awoke in the morning to the reveille of robins and thrushes.
With chirp and whistle and flute note, they sang him from his hearty
sleep to a still heartier realization of a new-born day. For a moment,
from the motherly lap of his broad bed, he blinked at the dimity
curtains and the age-ripened hautboy. What strange caravanserai was
this? It was always a pleasure to wake to the memory of the long tramp
of the preceding day--to trace his path from the brisk setting out of
the previous morning to the final lagging steps at dusk. To-day he
traced his course as far as the letter-box and then came to himself as
though fresh from a plunge in a mountain brook. But he had no time to
think about it before there was a timid knock at the door.

“Yes?” called Barnes.

“Your warm water, sir?”

“Come in.”

John stepped over the threshold. His stride was confident. He was bold
enough in the daytime whatever he might be at night.

“Miss Schuyler’s compliments, sir, and we breakfast at eight.”

“What time is it now?”

“Seven, sir.”

“Very well. My compliments in return to Eleanor and I will be ready at
eight.”

John betrayed wonder. Barnes reviewed his speech. Then he himself
betrayed even more wonder.

“Did you hear, John?” he demanded sternly, in a clumsy attempt to
retrieve himself. “My compliments to my aunt,” he paused, “and I will
be ready at eight.”

“Yes, sir.”

Barnes unconsciously looked about for his dress-suit case. Then he
remembered that he had checked it to the next village, thinking at
first to ride through. He did not have so much as a razor. He glanced
at John’s smooth-shaven face, hesitated, and then asked,

“John--didn’t I leave a razor behind me? Seems to me I remember a
black-handled one. If you could find it--”

Now John was in many respects an admirable man in his calling. If he
was positive no razor had been left, he had at least a razor of his own.

“I will see if I can find it, sir,” he said.

He was back in five minutes with the entire outfit which he placed
upon the dresser without a word. Barnes was immensely pleased with his
cleverness, while John, who had been the really clever one, remained
impassive. Furthermore, being in high good humor at the success of the
ruse which had saved him from the humiliation of borrowing from the
man, Barnes leaped from his bed so suddenly that John jumped half way
to the door.

“What’s the trouble?” inquired Barnes.

“You came so suddenly, sir.”

“Perhaps I _was_ a bit abrupt. The morning gets into your blood.”

“It’s the Arctic weather I presume, sir.”

“Yes. Ah, yes, that is probably it.”

He began to lather his face but John still delayed, shuffling a bit
nervously.

“You left ‘The Lucky Find’ well, sir?” he ventured with an apologetic
cough. It was as though he spoke of a lady. It was as though he spoke
of an intimate friend in whom he took great interest.

“Pretty well, thank you,” answered Barnes in some surprise.

“I reads as how you brought twenty million in gold out of the country
last year, sir.”

“I?”

“Oh, not you alone, sir, but all the mines together. I didn’t know but
what ‘The Lucky Find’ had a share in it, as the sayin’ goes.”

Barnes caught his breath. Then he carefully lathered one ear. It
didn’t need lathering any more than his shoes. It was something of an
automatic movement.

“Let me see,” he asked quietly, “how much stock did you have?”

“Not much, sir. I haven’t saved as much as I might. But when I saw the
papers you sent on to the mistress, I mailed what I had. It was only a
thousand, sir.”

“Yes, I remember now. A thousand dollars.”

Barnes turned back to the mirror. He wiped the lather from his ear.

“Bring my trousers, John.”

The man obeyed.

“Reach in the right hand side pocket.”

John brought out two five-dollar bills.

“Put one of them back.”

John obeyed and held the other one in his hand uncertainly.

“That,” said Barnes, “is our first annual dividend. It should have been
sent to you before.”

“Thank you, sir. I didn’t hope for so much, but--”

“You may go,” said Barnes, picking up his razor.

Barnes completed his dressing with dispatch. It occurred to him that if
he hurried he might possibly beat out Aunt Philomela, and so have a few
words with the girl before she came down.

As he stepped into the living-room, Aunt Philomela greeted him with a
curt nod.

“I trust three-fingered Bill didn’t disturb your dreams,” he observed
with polite interest.

The girl was nowhere to be seen.

“Bah. Something worse,” snapped Aunt Philomela as though she held him
directly responsible for it. “It was half a walrus.”

“Perhaps that is the Thing John was looking for,” he suggested.

He turned towards the window in the hope that he might discover Miss
Van Patten in the flower-gardens. They blossomed just beyond--a medley
of sweet alyssum, mignonette, heliotrope, cosmos, and marigolds. She
was not there.

“To what do you refer by the Thing?” demanded Aunt Philomela.

“The Thing he looked for under the bed.”

The color stole into her cheeks making them look more than ever like
cameos.

“In these days, with so many strangers on the road, one cannot be too
careful,” she avowed.

“No,” he admitted, “I understand that many estimable persons even in
New York make it a habit to look under their beds.”

At length Miss Van Patten came in. She was in white again with a loose
crimson tie at her throat. She looked as though she might have been in
the garden after all--growing there like the other flowers for she had
a freshness that only the dew can give. She greeted him with a smile
that brightened the room like the sun.

“Daddy is in better spirits than I’ve seen him for a year,” she
exclaimed. “He asked for you as soon as he woke up.”

“Perhaps then I had better step up there for a minute before breakfast.”

“Would you? He’s waiting so impatiently.”

“I’ll go at once.”

“He repeated to me what you told him. You didn’t tell us all.”

She blushed prettily, timid at sharing with him a secret in which her
aunt for the moment was not included.

“Most everything,” he replied uneasily.

“You don’t mind because he told me?”

She feared that he might consider it in the light of a confidence
betrayed.

“No,” he answered sincerely.

But lest she go further into the subject he turned abruptly and made
his way again to the room of shadows.

Aunt Philomela at once faced her niece.

“What is this great secret?” she demanded somewhat piqued.

“I’m not sure that I ought to tell you,” replied the girl with a
tinkling laugh which was like the ripple of water over pebbles.

“Pardon my presumption,” snapped the aunt cuttingly, as she assumed her
state dignity.

This consisted of standing so erect that she crinkled, drawing her chin
the slightest bit in, and folding her hands at the level of her waist.
The girl promptly stepped forward and kissed her.

“It was partly of you he spoke.”

Aunt Philomela drew back with a more genuine emotion.

“What an impertinence!” she exclaimed.

“Daddy evidently asked him if he saw any change in you.”

“Of all--”

“And Mr. Barnes told him he thought you had grown younger.”

“I shall thank William not to discuss me in the future.”

“Oh, but your ears would have burned if you’d heard the rest.”

“What wonder! To allow a stranger to discuss such intimate matters
is--is almost indecent.”

“Remember it was as Joe that Mr. Barnes spoke. But,” she added
thoughtfully, “I’m not sure Joe himself would have spoken so
beautifully.”

“The bold, young fellow.”

“The most wonderful thing of all,” continued the girl, her eyes growing
wistful, “was the way he talked to Daddy about mother. How was he able
to do that when he never knew her--never saw her?”

“Your mother,” replied Aunt Philomela, soberly, “would never forgive me
if she knew I countenanced such goings on.”

“How was he able to do it?” repeated Eleanor, her thoughts spanning a
decade.

Aunt Philomela scanned the girl’s face anxiously, lovingly.

“La, dear,” she murmured.

“He spoke of her eyes--describing them as woodland pools at twilight.
You remember mother’s eyes were just like that.”

“Yes, dear. They were like that--like your eyes.”

“He spoke of the tender sweetness of her face--of her black hair with
the gold in it. You remember the gold in mother’s hair?”

“Yes, dear. Your hair is much the same.”

“He even described her skin. He said it was like ivory with rose in it.”

“Yes,” answered Aunt Philomela, noting the rose now in the ivory of her
niece’s cheeks.

“That sounded almost as though he were standing in front of mother,
didn’t it? It is as though he saw a vision!”

Aunt Philomela pressed her lips firmly together. When, a moment later
Barnes himself came in, she kept her eyes fixed upon her niece.

“Eleanor,” she announced, “I shall ask Carl to come over this morning.”




CHAPTER VII

THE CALL OF THE ROAD


As soon as Mr. Van Patten dropped to sleep for his morning nap, Barnes
determined to suggest to the girl a plan he had conceived during
breakfast. That it would impress Aunt Philomela as audacious he had no
doubt; that it would meet with kindlier interest from Miss Van Patten,
he dared hope. With the decided improvement in the old gentleman’s
condition the spirit of the whole household rose high. Not only had
he slept well during the night, but he had partaken of a fairly good
breakfast.

The morning hour had also been easier for Barnes. Mr. Van Patten had
clung to the young boy--the boy before he had become himself and was
still merely his father’s boy. Barnes had scarcely more to do than
listen. Alaska had been forgotten.

The morning itself, too, gave courage. The sun, now in supreme
authority, held in the bondage of shadows every unsightly thing and
marshaled forth to the front its legions of the beautiful. Everywhere
it put youth in command; chief of all on the saffron road which ran
before the brick house and later connected with other roads which in
turn connected with still other roads until a path was made clear
across the continent.

The road summoned forth. It beckoned. The wonder was, thought Barnes as
from his window he caught glimpses of it winding in and out among the
trees up the hill and so on, either way, until it ran straight into an
ocean--the wonder was how these young fellows hereabouts resisted its
call. If a man but followed it in its intricacies he would pass, on the
way, every palace and hovel in the land. Rich man, poor man, beggar
man, thief, a traveler would come upon them every one. These tawny
ribbons drained every spring of human life. They demanded their toll
of time from all the world. And in the end, when the legs failed, all
the world was finally borne over this same road and lowered to one side
of it. The wonder was, then, that instead of a few dreaming poets and
a few lawless vagabonds that all the young men in the world were not
caught by the spell of the highway and the pageant it promised.

But what of the spell of the houses by the side of the highway? They
cried halt to the young men. Ah, there lay the explanation--the road
after all was subservient to the houses by its side.

But there were many houses by the side of the road; how did each house
choose its own? By the eyes of the women who dwelt in the houses.
Clearly then, the houses themselves were subservient.

Were the eyes of the women then the final masters? Here was a problem
for a philosopher. He knew only that he himself had been stopped, with
the road beckoning him on.

Miss Van Patten was busy for an hour with her household tasks before
she returned to where Barnes had stationed himself at the foot of the
Dutch door. A snow-white apron made her look very business-like. Aunt
Philomela was for the moment carelessly absent. Here was Opportunity.

“I had in mind,” he said, “going to the next village for my suit-case.
I checked it there thinking at first to ride through but the station
below here tempted me and I got off.”

“I’ll send John for it,” she replied, wondering that she herself had
not anticipated his need. The reason was, though her modesty made
her refrain from offering the explanation, that she never associated
baggage with men folk. To her they were always as untrammeled and
unburdened as her saddle horse Aladdin.

“But I looked forward to the walk,” he said.

“Oh!”

“I thought that perhaps you--”

“Oh,” she exclaimed again. But this time it was an entirely different
sort of an “Oh.” It was a shy, fluttering monosyllable--resembling
a bird who, flushed from its nest, flies but a little way. Her eyes
reflected a certain eagerness--her quick glance towards the door a
certain timidity. Her cheeks assumed a compromise.

“It would be just an easy turn, down and back, wouldn’t it? The sun is
calling.”

Now Aladdin had been chafing three days in his stall unheeded by his
mistress, whinnying an answer to the bugle call of this same sun as it
sifted in through the chinks. But the most satisfaction he had found
was in her whispered solace, “To-morrow, perhaps.” Yet of all living
things outside the house, she loved him best.

“It would be very pleasant,” she confessed.

“Then--?”

“I think I may go,” she determined.

Which proved--what? It is very difficult to prove anything at all
but this at least would seem to prove that Aunt Philomela was not as
vigilant as she might have been. She came in just as the girl was
adjusting her hat of brown Leghorn--in fact at the moment that Barnes
was engrossed in watching the bewitching operation of the tying of a
pert bow of damson-colored ribbon beneath an ear which looked of too
delicate workmanship to be of any actual use. But that it was seemed
evident from the fact that it detected Aunt Philomela’s steps long
before his own of coarser fiber heard anything at all.

“It’s an art,” declared Barnes to the little old lady as she stood in
the doorway, a living human question mark. “It’s an art to be able
to tie a bow-knot. I’ve practiced twenty years and succeeded only in
developing an affair with dropping ends which won’t come untied.”

Aunt Philomela did not display as much interest as she might in this
statement. She was one to go to the heart of things. She was not to be
decoyed from the nub of a situation. Very well, then, he decided, she
should have it.

“Eleanor and I,” he informed her, “thought of taking to the road.” He
added immediately not so bold as he had determined to be,

“I must get my bag.”

“John is at your service,” snapped Aunt Philomela, instantly.

“But John isn’t able to exercise for me; John isn’t able to drink in
the sun for me. There are many things that John couldn’t do for me.”

It was clear these considerations had little weight with her.

“Perhaps you’ll come along too?” he ventured.

If it had been within the realm of possibility for her to make her
feeble limbs wag over those four miles she would have taken him up
just to foil the childlike innocence with which he veiled his sense of
confident security. Even as it was, she contrived to frighten him.

“I will order the carriage.”

But here Miss Van Patten herself interposed.

“It’s too fine a day to drive,” she declared sensibly. “We’ll be back
by the time father wakes. Do you want anything at the village?”

“I wouldn’t for the world burden you,” Aunt Philomela answered, coldly.

Which, on the whole, thought Barnes, was a reply unworthy of her.

So it happened that within less than twenty-four hours, Barnes took up
the trail again--with a difference. In the first place he no longer
carried his portfolio. Moreover he did not miss it. And yet he had not
proceeded a hundred yards before he passed material enough to fill it.
He gave scarcely a glance at the old patriarchs of apple-trees looking
like muscle-knotted dwarfs engaged in the absurd task of supporting
green apples no larger than marbles; at the sturdy pines whispering
Norwegian sagas, the lithe birches, and the shivering poplars.

“Daddy and I have taken this road so many times. He loves it,”
exclaimed Miss Van Patten.

“Of course he does!” he nodded.

She turned her eyes towards him in some amazement at his assurance.

“You understand Daddy so well,” she said.

“The big emotions,” he declared thoughtfully, “make us all of kin.
Man-sorrows draw men together as women-sorrows draw women together.
Sound us deep enough and all men are brothers, all women sisters. Sound
us still deeper and even sex vanishes; we become just comrades.”

“Aunt Philomela proves the rule? I wish she were in better humor.”

“I wouldn’t for a fortune have her change,” he returned quickly.

“You don’t mind her sharp tongue?”

“It relieves me of a great responsibility.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Aunt Philomela,” he declared, “is attorney for the world. There’s
nothing like a stiff prosecution to stiffen one’s own defense--if it’s
a fair one.”

“Oh, I see.”

That was doubtful but she thought she saw, which is quite as
satisfactory.

“In a way your aunt’s opposition is the old case of Art versus
Reality,” he continued, “the Academy versus the Acme. But Lord forgive
us, the controversy is a purely scholastic one. If we only get deep
enough in our thoughts, as in our emotions, we find ourselves again
all one. Aunt Philomela isn’t so suspicious of me as she is of my
portfolio.”

“She isn’t really ferocious,” she assured him. “And she _does_
appreciate your kindness.”

“That, at any rate, doesn’t matter.”

“The change in father this morning is marvelous. It made me know that
we’re doing right--however strange it seems.”

“Does it seem strange to you?”

“It certainly is--unusual.”

“Yes, I suppose it is and yet it isn’t anything more than the road led
me to expect.”

“That’s what it is to be a man,” she smiled. “Women are allowed to
expect so little.”

He was studying her mouth. It was so simply and yet so marvelously
drawn. He had decided it was a child’s mouth, but at this he glanced up
quickly.

“And yet,” he said, “women are the mothers of expectancy.”

She turned away her head without replying. She was a bit shy of his
loose generalizing. She brought him back again to her father. She made
vivid to him the days of close comradeship she had passed with the old
gentleman during these last two years. After this he led her out to
tell him more of the neighbors and of her life among them. He listened
for the names and made it a point to fix them in his mind. Among them
as she rambled on there was one Carl Langdon, he noted, who stood out
a bit more than the others. Langdon it seemed, played a violin and she
herself was musical. He refused to satisfy his curiosity by pressing
any further along this line than she of her own accord led him. Yet, as
it was, there were several little things about Langdon which excited
his interest.

Before they knew it, they reached the beginning of the descent which
led into the village of white houses huddled at the foot of the
surrounding hills, like sheep pressing warm sides together against a
blizzard. At the glimpse of the steel path of the railroad, Barnes
impulsively turned away.

“Shall we go back?” he asked.

“Yes,” she answered absent-mindedly.

So they retraced their steps over the same road, which yet seemed
to him a new road. On the return he found himself reciprocating
her confidence by telling something of his own life. It seemed an
uninteresting enough tale and yet he found her listening with apparent
eagerness. In fact before he knew it she had led him a great deal
further than he had intended to go. He had proposed covering only the
blunt facts of his life such as their present relations gave her a
right to know, but before he realized it he had gone into a great many
more intimate details.

It was not until they were within sight of the house, that he awoke to
what her eyes had enticed from him. Then he drew himself up short, a
bit startled by the phenomenon. He was usually reticent about himself.

“I beg your pardon,” he apologized, “I must have bored you.”

“You haven’t,” she answered frankly.

“At any rate,” he said, “I had no idea of going into those matters.”

She smiled again and this time he saw that her mouth was after all not
a child’s mouth.

Aunt Philomela met them at the door, as though she had been some
time waiting for them. She fixed her eyes upon the girl as though to
discover at a glance what this morning contained. Then she turned to
Barnes, raising her scant eyebrows a trifle.

“You gave your bag to the marketman to bring back?” she asked blandly.

Bag? Bag, to be sure. It was a blow straight from the shoulder. It was
another case of where he had not carried out his original intentions.

“I have decided,” stammered Barnes, “that if you will be so good, you
may send John for it.”

“And the other things you mentioned?”

“I’ve been able to attend to myself.”

The girl was trying to edge by into the house. Aunt Philomela stopped
her.

“Carl is waiting in the sitting-room for you,” she announced. “He is
anxious to meet--your brother.”




CHAPTER VIII

AN ESTIMABLE YOUNG MAN


Barnes found himself shaking hands with a pleasant looking young fellow
of twenty-two or three who had a thin, earnest face and curly brown
hair.

“This _is_ a surprise,” exclaimed Langdon, “I didn’t know Miss Van
Patten had a brother.”

“I did come as a bit of surprise,” admitted Barnes, “but so did you for
that matter.”

“I?”

Miss Van Patten was taking as long a time as possible to remove her
hat. Her cheeks were decidedly scarlet. But she did not run as Barnes
half expected her to do. She returned and dropped into a chair before
the two men.

“This is as good as a story-book, Miss Van Patten,” exclaimed Langdon.

“It’s better than a story-book,” she laughed.

“When I received your note last night I thought you must be ill or
something. Miss Schuyler said this morning that you had gone to walk.”

“Yes,” she murmured uneasily.

“We went after my baggage,” explained Barnes.

“So Miss Schuyler said. She tells me you’ve had lots of interesting
experience in Alaska. I tried to get her to repeat some of your
adventures but she told me I’d have to wait until I saw you.”

“So?” grinned Barnes, “but she knows almost as much about them now, as
I do myself.”

“Nothing like getting them first hand,” said Langdon.

He turned to Miss Van Patten.

“I was afraid we’d have to give up our duets if you had a guest. But we
can go on with them now--mayn’t we? Unless Mr. Van Patten needs quiet.”

“Oh, he’s much improved,” the girl assured him.

Langdon entered into a rhapsody over some new music which had just been
sent him from New York. Manifestly Barnes was not needed here. He made
his apologies.

“But I say,” exclaimed Langdon as Barnes was leaving, “I want to hear
something about that country.”

“Whenever you wish,” answered Barnes.

He retreated to the library and finding paper there sat down to write
home. He headed his letter “Schuyler headquarters.”

“Dear Mother,” he began, “I saw your eyes yesterday in the straggling
mist of some cotton-blossom clouds and they brought you very near to
me. This is a wonderful country. I know that enough of you has survived
the apartment houses and the Acme to allow you to enjoy it if you were
here. The hawthorn in your blood would respond to the glad sunshine and
the unsmirched sky. And the quiet too is such as you would like. You
remember the walks we used to take in the Park on clear mornings when
it seemed like a fairy island? It is like that here. I want to thank
you right now for the times you took me to the Zoo. I didn’t think then
that the information I picked up would prove so valuable. I don’t know
what I should have done here without my knowledge of polar bears. One
of the great delights of Art is that sooner or later every tittle of
information one picks up is used. Art wastes nothing except time.

“My exercise has kept me in the best of condition. This morning I made
only four miles but before that I have consistently covered fifteen.
I think I shall linger a little here. I’ve found material for a big
picture. The subject is different from anything you’ve ever seen of
mine. I think even father might appreciate this. I’ve about decided
to attempt it in oils; a sort of study in black and gold and damson
preserves.” He scratched out damson preserves and substituted crimson.
“I’m uncertain about the size of the canvas. Sometimes I think it
ought to be heroic, like the Santa Barbara at Venice, and at other
times I feel as though I can convey the impression of its fineness only
in a miniature. Then again I feel as though it ought to be swept in
with bold color strokes, and at other times as though it ought to be
just suggested in grays. You see--”

Someone came to the door.

“Pardon me,” apologized Miss Van Patten, “I didn’t know you were here.”

He rose instantly.

“Won’t you come in for a moment?” he pleaded. “Has Mr. Langdon gone?”

“He has returned for his music.”

“Oh, I see.”

“He plays very well.”

“On the flute?”

“The violin. He has studied abroad. He’s here for the summer visiting
Dr. Merriweather.”

“And you--you play?”

“On the ’cello--but only a very little. I’m afraid this--this new
complication is going to be rather embarrassing. I don’t like to tell
Carl untruths.”

“You needn’t. Leave that to me. Won’t you come in?”

She hesitated and then stepped in resolutely. She settled comfortably
into a big chair on the opposite side of the library table.

“At first,” she said, “I thought only of Daddy and Aunt Philomela. But
now that others are brought in, it doesn’t seem quite right to them,
does it?”

“It seems inevitable and what is inevitable is right.”

She shook her head,

“I’m afraid you’re mistaken. But at any rate what is inevitable is
inevitable. There seems nothing to do now but make the best of it.”

She appeared genuinely worried. He tried to change the subject.

“I was writing home,” he explained.

“Then,” she declared, “I shouldn’t disturb you. When one is writing
home one needs absolute quiet.”

He was still standing. She thought he had a very soldier-like
appearance. He really looked more like a soldier than an artist as
she had conceived artists. Even his blond mustache had an aggressive
military air. It was trimmed so short and cut so straight that it
challenged the suggestion that it was there merely for ornament.

He returned quickly to the first subject.

“I myself did not by chance have anything of a musical education?” he
asked.

“You?”

“Joe.”

She laughed.

“No,” she answered. “You refused to practice.”

“It is just as well. Yet I remember the story of a French prisoner who
to save his life, learned to play upon a trumpet in a single night.”

“Luckily you won’t need to do that but I think you could.”

“Luckily for Mr. Langdon. Otherwise we should have a trio.”

She had risen and was now nearing the door.

“Will you come in and listen to us?” she asked.

He reflected a moment to keep her longer by the door.

“No,” he decided, “I think I’ll not, thank you.”

“Carl seemed quite anxious to see more of you.”

“I’m afraid he will--the best I can do.”

“I must run up and see if father is awake,” she said and vanished.

With a sigh Barnes returned to his letter.

“I might paint her in an open doorway,” he wrote, “upon the point of
leaving. She would be half turned, posed in so light a fashion that the
onlooker would be half afraid she was about to vanish from the canvas.
She should appear startled as though hearing the approach of--”

He glanced up. Aunt Philomela stood in the doorway. He rose again. She
paused uncertainly.

“Won’t you come in?” he welcomed her bravely though she looked
suspiciously as though loaded for bear.

“I thought Eleanor might be here,” she observed, as though she expected
him to feel guilty.

“She left only a moment ago,” he answered frankly.

She appeared to be taking aim.

“I was writing home,” he took her into his confidence to ward off as
long as possible whatever might be coming.

“I thought artists had no homes.”

“On the contrary they have more homes than anyone else.”

“I suppose that depends upon your definition of a home,” she suggested.

“Doubtless,” he agreed.

“To my mind it is where one is brought up.”

“Lord forbid,” he gasped, thinking of the apartment houses.

“And where one’s own kith and kin are.”

“Then if one got married--”

“That is quite another matter,” she snapped so decisively as to forbid
further argument along this line.

But one must have a subject, thought Barnes, or one could not tell what
subject Chance might introduce. Aunt Philomela had the self-conscious
air of one who has approached with a mission.

“I was writing home about a piece of work I have in mind.”

“Work?” she asked with some scorn.

“A picture,” he explained amiably, “there’s a lot of work in one.”

“I’m afraid you’ll have little time for it here.”

“On the contrary, the inspiration for it came from here.”

“I’ve seen inspiration for nothing but deceit. I refused to tell him
anything whatever about Alaska.”

“Mr. Langdon, you mean?”

“Who else? I was left here alone an hour with him.”

“It did make a bit of a complication, but it’s all adjusted now. I
suppose I’ll have to tell all over again about three-fingered Bill.”

“This is disgraceful,” she exploded, “I’ve a good mind to confess the
whole matter and have it done with.”

“But it wouldn’t be done with even if you did that. It would be almost
sure to reach Mr. Van Patten’s ears.”

“It would be better if it did. It’s the first time a Schuyler has not
faced things squarely.”

“Pardon me, but can’t we just as well face the present situation
squarely? We are working to save a father’s mind--isn’t that a
situation to face squarely?”

“We’re forced into the position of deceiving him and not only him but a
most estimable young man.”

“Ah, a most estimable young man!”

“I should die of shame if ever Carl discovered our trickery.”

“And your brother would die of grief if ever _he_ discovered it. But he
won’t.”

He turned upon her a bit nettled.

“Aunt Philomela,” he said, “now that we have begun, we must play the
game for all it’s worth. That is another thing the Schuylers have
always done, haven’t they? You and I and the estimable young man count
for nothing in this. Do you think I would play it for myself alone?”

Aunt Philomela looked a bit chagrined.

“No,” she said, “I suppose--I suppose we do owe you a great debt.”

[Illustration: The soft grass had muffled his approach so that for a
moment she was unaware that she was not alone.

                                                          _See page 19_]

“You owe me nothing. I’m well repaid by my inspirations and by a
certain easing of my conscience in a little family affair of my own.
But even without those things I should still be repaid. And even if I
were not repaid at all, I’d again gladly undertake it. Only we must
pull together, Aunt Philomela, and we must stick it out to the end.”

“But,” she trembled, “what is the end?”

“God knows,” he answered.

She was edging towards the door.

“I--I spoke rather hastily,” she half apologized.

“So did I.” He smiled. “Often times we most easily tell the truth that
way.”

She vanished. Barnes returned to his letter.

“So you see,” he wrote, “I have my hands full. I will write from time
to time, but I’m so uncertain in my movements that I can give no
address. You may always know that I am busy and in good spirits.

                                                        Your son, Dick.”

The second letter was more easily accomplished.

  “DEAR FATHER,--I’m head over heels in work and know that you are the
  same. I trust your work is counting for as much as mine. Hoping this
  will find you in your usual good health, I beg to remain,

                                                  Your prodigal son,

                                                               RICHARD.”

As he scrawled the addresses, he heard the tuning of instruments in the
sitting-room. He hastily sealed the envelopes and hurried out. The sun
was just setting. The old brick house looked very mellow.

He walked to the tin mail-box and dropped in his letters.




CHAPTER IX

A LULLABY


As it happened, it was this very night that Barnes almost got a fair
start upon his picture--almost found the inspiration to do it, as he
expressed it, in a sort of gasp. One can no more foretell inspiration
than one can Opportunity. Both come silently, unheralded, like angels
and like angels stand dimly but a moment at the elbow and then vanish.

Barnes was sitting with Mr. Van Patten in the twilight. He had passed a
pleasant and peaceful hour with the old gentleman while the latter had
recalled a dozen little episodes of Joe’s childhood. Barnes had nothing
to do but remember. Did Barnes remember that time he had been taken
down town and had his hair clipped? Did Barnes remember that time when
they visited the circus and saw the elephant which he had thought wrong
end to? Did Barnes remember that glad day and the other? He remembered
them every one with no more effort than to review his own boyhood with
his own father. It struck him as curious how much alike they were.

So with smile and chuckle and warm pressure of the hand, the father
himself became a boy again and rambled on over many a tale of his own
youth which in turn was again marvelously like that of Barnes’ own
youth. The mellow light hallowed the old man’s white-bearded face;
the homing birds twittered sleepily without; the drowsy chirp of the
tree-toads and the warm chittering of the crickets led him into a
content like that of the valley of shadows, though the sun still burned
at the flamboyant horizon line.

From time to time the father napped only to awake if Barnes stirred a
muscle. Then he would feel about until he found the boy’s hand again
and settle back into a content born of utter trust. It gave a sober
turn to Barnes’ thoughts.

It was at this point that Mr. Van Patten awoke and called for Eleanor.

“Tell her I’d like to have her play a little to me, Joe.”

Glad of the relief, still gladder of this opportunity to bring her
again upon the canvas, Barnes joyfully went below for her. The father
had hit upon just what was needed at this hour. Nothing but music could
harmonize the abrupt contrast of the aggressive beauty outside and
the somber spectacle of this recumbent figure within. Never yet has
there been a sect so austere as to bar the sensuous strains of music
even when serenest in the confidence of their prayers. Though they may
modulate it to a hymn, though they may deaden it to a dirge, though
they may refine it to a mere chant, still they cling to some wordless
cadence to wing their prayerful words. Music was needed here though an
almost religious peace prevailed.

Barnes found the girl seated beside her aunt in the sitting-room. If
anyone could play to such an hour, to such a mood, he thought as he
entered the room, it was she. She carried him back to some of the big
unexplained moments of his life. One Sunday night in London he had
come upon a group of Welshmen in Hyde Park who had gathered there to
hold in the big city’s vastest cathedral--the blue night sky above the
Marble Arch--their homely services. Stubborn, angular men-shadows they
were, grouped in close, with the burdened women-shadows hovering upon
the outskirts. Without accompaniment of anything but their beating
hearts, they lifted their sturdy voices in rough chorus--the gypsy
melodies going back to Druid times when so their ancestors had stood
half terrified by the unknown power they invoked among the wiser trees.
At the sound of it, Barnes had felt himself a part of all the centuries
that had ever been and had risen to a dignity of emotion which he had
never felt since save at this moment he stood upon the threshold here
to summon her to make music for the man above.

Wherein lay the connection? He could not say, save that it had
something to do with her black hair; something with the vagueness of
her outline in the shadows; something with the solemnity of that common
human love which gropes for companionship with that common higher love.
Emotions, like religions, gain something in power by remaining part
mystery.

“Your father,” Barnes announced, “wishes you to play for him.”

She rose at once.

“Very well,” she answered.

“And I may listen, too?” he asked.

“If you wish,” she replied without embarrassment, “the things he likes
are simple.”

“The things I like are simple,” he answered.

“Oh, dear,” murmured Aunt Philomela, a note of fear in her voice. “They
say it’s a bad sign when the sick call for music.”

“I should say it was a good sign,” said Barnes. “It proves them to be
at peace.”

“But isn’t that a bad sign?”

“It depends upon your theory of life.”

“It doesn’t seem normal, somehow,” she answered with a little sigh.

“Why, Aunty,” exclaimed the girl, “what has come over you? You know
Daddy often asks me to play for him.”

“But at this time of day! It’s sort of creepy.”

“You’ve sat too long in the dark,” the girl declared, “I’ll have a
candle brought unless you wish to join us.”

“Oh, dear no. I couldn’t stand it. He always insists upon the dark and
it is quite too--funereal.”

“You mustn’t get morbid, Aunty.”

Miss Van Patten stooped and kissed the cameo forehead and then rose and
smoothed back the silken gray hair a moment.

“It isn’t that. It is--”

Aunt Philomela did not finish. Whatever it was, Barnes found himself
feeling uncomfortable for a moment. He knew that the old have certain
senses which mercifully are denied the young.

Miss Van Patten stepped into the next room and returned with her
’cello. He reached to take it from her but she smiled a refusal and
bore it up the stairs by her side as lightly as though it had no
weight. It was as though she would trust it in no other hands but her
own. This promised well.

“Come over here near me, Joe,” the father requested as soon as they
entered the room, “You haven’t heard her since she was a little girl.
She plays wonderfully.”

So Barnes sat by the bedside while the daughter took a position near
the open window. It was now quite dark. The twilight noises were
hushed. One could imagine oneself anywhere and Barnes chose to go back
to that still Spring night in Hyde Park when he had looked up at the
stars and heard, for the first time, their music partly expressed.

There was no preliminary tuning to mar the first perfect note she drew
from the instrument. There was scarcely a motion of the bow. It came
deep-chested as though summoned by the mere caressing of the hand.
She played first a serenade as graceful and as full of color as the
doves darting about St. Marks; then a lighter Spanish air, and then
Rath’s “Leonore,” and then swung off into a group of negro melodies
which she herself had arranged. But neither to the older man nor to
the younger man did the theme itself much matter--it served only to
wing their thoughts. The underlying baritone voice of the ’cello lent
to Barnes’ imaginings eagle wings. He rode the winds with a sure power
that lifted him above the heads of the huddled group of Welshmen--above
the greater huddled group called London, even to that brighter upper
region where men and cities and nations count in the prospect not so
much as the unpeopled mountains. There he beat the ether with his
strong new-fledged wings and soared into some vague halcyon future.
So he rose and fell and rose again among the clouds with the gentle
undulations of the ’cello notes which swayed as rhythmically as
heavy-leaved tree limbs to a breeze. But never did he rise so high that
he was not conscious of the girl’s figure in the dark. Always she was
there; always she was the inspiration. He realized that it was from
some such height as this that he must paint her. It seemed as though he
could do it here now--in the dark. How would he do it? He smiled at his
conceit. He would paint a canvas with such wizardry that to all those
whose hearts were not in tune with it, it should appear to be only a
rich purple background without figures. But to those who soared in the
upper ether it should, as they looked, take form. First as their warm
eyes rested upon it a shadow should emerge and gently materialize into
the likeness of her. Then out of this her radiant face should appear.
Then her white arm holding the bow, and then the scarcely perceptible
outline of the ’cello and finally her black hair with gold in it. And
if one were big enough of heart, one would know that she was playing a
barcarole and that another was listening.

If only he had his paints--if only he had his paints! One had only to
hold one’s breath and--

As he straightened, the father stirred uneasily. The girl had stopped
and without speaking rested her cheek against the strings. He had lost
his moment. His hand was unsteady when the old man found it.

“You are moved,” murmured the father. “No wonder.”

“No,” answered Barnes below his breath, “it’s no wonder.”

But now she took her bow again. She began a Southern lullaby--a lullaby
with more of plaintive mother love in it than even the masters have
ever caught. This time she added her voice--just breathing the words
so that it was scarcely possible to tell whether it was she who was
singing or the untongued instrument itself.

  “H’m--H’m,” she crooned, “H’m--H’m.
    When I was a little baby
  I remember long ago
    Daddy would sit all ebnin’
  An’ play de ole banjo
    Mammy den would call me ‘Honey’
  Take me upon her knee
    An’ foldin’ me to her bosom
  Would sing dis song to me.”

As she began the chorus Barnes’ own voice stole in to join her,
whereupon she improvised an alto and left him to carry the air.

  “Doan ye cry, ma honey
  Doan ye weep no mo’
  Mammy’s gwine to hold her baby
  All de udder black trash sleepin’ on de flo’
  Mammy only lubs her boy.”

When they had finished and while the ’cello still hummed on, she
whispered,

“He’s asleep. That song always lulls him to sleep.”

She rose and beckoned him to follow. He turned to the old man. He was
breathing regularly. He loosened his fingers and crept across the room,
closing the door behind him. Miss Van Patten had waited for him at the
head of the stairs.

“I shall never forget this hour,” he said.

“I played the things he enjoys.”

“What did the songs themselves matter?” he burst out.

“You two must be much alike,” she smiled.

“No. If he went where you took me, he wouldn’t be asleep.”

She moved down the stairs. He checked her.

“I wish we could sit here--a moment. It seems wicked to go down into
the light right off.”

She glanced up a bit startled. He could see her eyes by the glow which
came up from the sitting room.

“We must go down right away,” she answered quickly. “Aunt Philomela is
waiting for us.”

He dared not insist further. Before he reached the bottom of the stairs
he was sorry that he had ventured that far. It was to the lady of his
picture he had spoken and she, this girl by his side, well she was not
the lady of his picture.

They found Aunt Philomela asleep by the candle. Her hands were folded
in her lap and her head was bowed.

“You see,” whispered Miss Van Patten. “The music made her drowse too in
spite of herself.”

“What did you say?” inquired Aunt Philomela suddenly sitting up with
the exaggerated look of wide awakeness of one who endeavors thereby to
prove she has been wide awake all the time.

“I thought you were asleep,” answered the girl, stepping into the room.

“Asleep?” she answered tartly, “with that thing buzzing in one’s ears.”

“I quite agree with you,” smiled Barnes. “The ’cello is the last thing
in the world to inspire sleep in the young.”

“It makes the most melancholic of sounds,” she sighed.

“There I _cannot_ agree with you,” returned Barnes. “It sings most
optimistically to me.”

“I prefer my music in the daytime,” she affirmed.

“Perhaps your taste runs to duets,” Barnes suggested.

Miss Van Patten had placed her instrument in the corner and was now
returning.

“I think my niece plays very prettily with Carl,” agreed Aunt Philomela.

Barnes tried to reach the girl’s eyes. He couldn’t. He frowned.

“I heard them tuning up,” he remarked. “They seemed to do that very
well.”

Aunt Philomela arose with that decisiveness which brooked no argument.
It was disgracefully early to retire and yet he knew she had that in
mind. And she would bear off the girl with her.

Which, with a curt good-night, she promptly did.




CHAPTER X

ON TROUT FISHING AND BOW-KNOTS


With what seemed to Barnes an inspired appetite, Mr. Van Patten
expressed a wish for brook-trout.

“Eleanor knows the stream,” he said. “And perhaps you yourself would
enjoy a little fishing.”

“I’d like nothing better,” Barnes responded heartily. “I’ll see if she
will go this afternoon.”

Accordingly he began a still hunt for her and surprised her from ambush
as she was passing through the living-room.

“Your father wishes us to go fishing,” he informed her bluntly lest she
should disappear before he had time to announce the glad news.

“Oh dear, I have so much to do,” she exclaimed.

“Are the duets on again this morning?” he inquired.

“No, it isn’t that.”

“Then?”

“Aunt Philomela is at her accounts. She becomes so confused when
adding.”

“I sympathize with her.”

“In making up her column,” she explained. “Aunt insists upon putting
down what each item is for; then she tries to add the items as well as
the figures. Like adding parsnips and butter.”

“They are very good when added in a frying-pan,” he averred.

“But you can’t add them in a column. She only does it towards the end.”

“But your father’s fish,” he reminded her.

“Perhaps you would go alone?”

“I enjoy fishing,” he answered with a sinking heart, “but that wouldn’t
bring your father a fish. I never have any luck. To-day we must be pot
hunters and work for results.”

“Well, if Daddy wishes a trout he ought to have one I suppose,” she
thought aloud.

“Undoubtedly,” he declared.

“Then I’ll be ready in twenty minutes.”

“May I dig the bait while you’re gone?” he inquired.

“The trout rise very well to flies,” she informed him.

For which he was glad. He was not prudishly sensitive about such things
but still he would not enjoy watching her impale a worm. It was a
wriggling function that he himself did not particularly relish, less
from humanitarian than æsthetic scruples.

She returned dressed in a short khaki skirt of hunting green, a
wide-brimmed boy’s straw hat and with a wicker fish-basket slung over
her shoulder. Her feet were encased in high oiled boots. She stepped
to the closet and brought out two rod cases, a book of flies, and two
reels.

“Have you any choice of weight?” she asked holding out both rods.

“You’d better give me the heavier one,” he suggested off hand.

The most of his fishing had been done from a flat boat with a bamboo
pole. Still he did not intend to admit to her such unsportsmanlike
conduct. He knew nothing of fly fishing but he was determined to
observe her closely and follow her example in every detail. When
in college he had gone South with some friends for a week of bird
shooting and had acquitted himself creditably by this method, though
he had never before held a gun. In the same way, by his quickness and
determination, he had ridden fifteen miles the first time he was ever
upon a horse.

They left the house without seeing Aunt Philomela, though as he went
down the path Barnes felt her eyes burning into his back. They crossed
the road and pushed through the fields to the meadow-brook. They
followed the banks for the matter of half a mile before she finally
stopped to put together the poles.

She glanced at the sky, at the water, and then ran her pink finger tips
over the gorgeous medley of brightly-feathered flies. She selected one
for herself and handed the book to him.

“I’m trying a Silver Moth,” she announced.

It took him longer to decide because there were no more Silver Moths,
but he finally drew out a gay scarlet fly with a body of mottled brown.
Its coloring was as daintily bright as that of a butterfly. He went
upon the simple theory that if _he_ were a trout it would be with some
such fastidious temptation that he himself would coquet. He adjusted it
slowly with one eye upon her.

She poised herself upon the edge of the bank with her figure erect,
alert, every fine line pulsating with life. With a full, free arm
movement she swung the lithe pole back, then forward. The Silver Moth
circled her head, paused a moment ten yards behind her, and then
following the swishing line darted straight out over the stream, swift
as a homing bee and kissed the water with scarcely a ripple. She drew
it back and this time sent it even farther. Then once again, until the
long line reached almost to the opposite bank.

What a picture that would make! Diana with her hounds was not half the
subject. What gentle strength there was in every movement--what rhythm,
and above the beautiful body, what a head. The wonder of those features
was that they lived up to any part you wished to assume for them. A
short while ago they had consistently upheld the traditions of Venice;
still later they had blended into dusk dreams; now they expressed the
elemental beauty of the Indian.

As the Silver Moth rippled against the current, she turned to see what
he was about. She saw and turned back again to the Silver Moth.

“What fly are you using?” she inquired.

“A butterfly,” he answered with an intake of breath.

Then he roused himself and contrived to get the bit of feather into the
water, though he was glad she did not observe the process.

He offered up a silent invocation:

“Oh, trout, king of all your fellows come to my hook and I will hallow
your death with prayers of thanksgiving. Set me well before her eyes
and I vow never to disturb your finny kingdom again.”

Had he only anticipated such an emergency as this he would have given
over the hours he had wasted so idly in dreams all these years, to the
perfecting himself in the art of casting a fly. There were those days
in London; he saw now that he could have used the Thames to much better
advantage than in merely gazing at its dull fogs; there was the Seine,
and he had stood lazily upon its banks for hours content in watching
the little barges puff up and down.

He felt a ferocious tug at his line. Before he recovered from his
surprise a speckled red body flung itself from the water and, striking
it again in a churning splash, cut an arrow-like course down stream.
He felt as though the line were knotted about his heart. He knew well
enough that now the thing to do was to keep the line taut.

“At any cost,” he muttered grimly.

“You’ve hooked him!” he heard her voice.

That was not quite accurate; the trout had hooked himself. But if there
was any grace in the strong will of a man he would keep him hooked.

She withdrew her line to give him plenty of room and to watch him.
There are few things a man cannot do if the right woman is watching
him. He fought the big trout back and forth, anticipating by instinct
every sudden turn, every inshore dart, every upstream flash. The line
did not slacken a quarter of an inch. Foot by foot he forced the
speckled beauty towards the bank. He was not even deceived when for
a second the fish lay passive a second and then darted towards the
shelter of a group of bowlders. He checked him within the very shadow
of this hiding-place. Then inch by inch he reeled again, dragging him
in relentlessly towards his hand.

“Oh!” she exclaimed. “We should have brought the landing-net. But we
don’t often have use for it in these waters.”

He drew the line still closer towards his itching fingers. He grasped
it. He gave it a tug and in another second had tossed upon the grass
the largest trout ever taken from Schuyler brook.

She clapped her hands in applause.

“He’s a beauty,” she cried enthusiastically.

“Pretty fair,” he confessed modestly.

“And you handled him so well!” she praised.

“Thank you.”

“And to think you captured him with a Scarlet Beauty. I have never been
able to get a rise with that fly.”

“On a bright day,” he replied sagely, “and in slow waters, they seem to
work very well.”

“Your judgment was sound,” she admitted.

“It was the judgment of the gods.”

“Then the gods are certainly with you.”

“They are,” he confessed brazenly.

“I think I shall change my fly,” she determined. “What should you
advise?”

He picked out for her a pretty tasseled thing which contained a touch
of crimson such as was on his.

“I’d try this,” he counseled. “And I shall stand by and see how it
works.”

“But you’re going to fish too?”

“No. I’ve discharged my filial duties. Your father has his trout.”

“Then we must get one for Aunt Philomela.”

“I must refrain. I’m under certain obligations.”

“Obligations?” she questioned.

“To my prize. To the king,” he answered waving his hand airily towards
the gasping fish.

Acting upon this, he, to her wonder, packed up his rod, placed his
trout in the basket, and took a comfortable seat a little to the right
of her.

Truly the gods were with him. Had they not listened to his invocation?
Otherwise he must have stood upon the bank and given over his whole
thought to the matter of casting a bit of feather upon the waters. He
could have studied the sky only as it was reflected in the stream, and
only as much of her as he could catch from the corner of his eye. And
always there would have been the danger of an entangling alliance
between his hook and her gown with the consequent embarrassment of
showing ill before her. He must have been born under Pisces.

Again and again she cast her line for Aunt Philomela without success.
But what Aunt Philomela lost, he gained. He won a new memory of her
at every strong-limbed movement. He prayed for failure. Surely, he
thought, that estimable lady would cheerfully surrender the mere item
of a delectable morsel or two for such pictures as these.

But Miss Van Patten herself did not relish the position as much as she
might. She was conscious of being watched and this, unless a girl be
vain, is not pleasant no matter how delicately the watching is done. So
she slowly reeled in her line.

“Surely, you don’t mean to deprive Aunt Philomela of her fish?” he
hastened to protest.

“I think she would rather have me finish her accounts,” she affirmed.

“If we tried a few moments longer--”

“I have noticed,” she declared, continuing to reel in her line, “that
when at the beginning you land a big fish, the little fishes cease to
bite.”

He felt guilty, as though he had been the means of depriving her of
her sport. As she left the bank he took her pole and dismembered it
for her, prolonging the task as long as possible. He wished now that
he had not caught his fish so soon. The ideal way to fish with her,
he thought, would be to have a trout concealed in one’s pocket and so
with no responsibility dabble with the fly until the opportune moment
for going home arrived and then deftly hook the fish upon the line
and produce it. The pity of life was that no sooner had one prettily
solved some problem by experience than the opportunity for using it was
gone. It might well be that Mr. Van Patten would never have again so
convenient a taste for trout.

Barnes was in hope that perhaps she might seat herself, if he were long
enough about this business of packing up the rods, but she didn’t.
She watched him with interest but with no other thought in mind than
returning to the house as soon as he was ready. So with a little sigh,
he finally tied the cloth case at the top in a knot that no human being
could ever separate without the use of a knife.

“I never can untie that,” she protested.

“All you have to do,” he assured her with honest conviction, “is to
pull the loop string.”

“Don’t you know how to make a real bow-knot?” she asked.

“Isn’t that a bow-knot?”

“A bow-knot has two loops and comes untied,” she informed him.

“I thought the object of a knot was to remain tied. Mine have at least
that advantage.”

“But you want them to untie sometime.”

“You cut mine when you wish to undo them,” he explained.

“That is both wasteful and untidy. I will show you.”

Here was a lesson worth learning. He handed her the rod. She pulled
gingerly at the string but only succeeded in fixing the knot more
firmly than ever. She removed a pin from her hat and began to pick. It
was a long process but it gave him time to admire the nimbleness of her
fingers. The knot became loosened only too soon.

“There,” she exclaimed. “Now you take it so and you do like this.”

It was tied in the snap of a finger.

“Then, when you pull one end of either string, it becomes unfastened.”

She demonstrated. He took the rod and tried the same process clumsily.
She came nearer and guided his fingers. He caught the perfume of her
hair. It was like dying clover. He felt the electric thrill of her
fingers. It only made him the clumsier.

She gave up in despair.

“You will never learn,” she declared.

“I can always try.”

“You must practice by yourself.”

“I have done so for years.”

“Then,” she said, “you must never tie any but your own things.”

“Then,” he reflected, “anything that I wish to tie hard, I must first
own.”

But he didn’t own the rod, so she tied that herself. As they rose to go
Carl approached.

“Hello,” he called, “fishing?”

“No,” answered Barnes, “hunting.”




CHAPTER XI

ON ADVENTURING


Carl was asked to supper and Mr. Van Patten insisted that the prize
should be cooked for the guest. The king trout was avenged for his
fate. Yet there could be no denying that he made a pretty dish. Through
the crackling skin, thin as gold-leaf, the scarlet speckles still
showed, so that, garnished with parsley as he was, he looked as content
upon the platter as though he were still nosing through water-cress in
his native element.

Carl was placed opposite Miss Van Patten, and Barnes was thus left to
face Aunt Philomela.

“I trust your accounts balanced,” he ventured to inquire of her.

“Within a peck of potatoes,” answered Aunt Philomela indifferently.

“That I should say was doing very well.”

“For an artist, perhaps.”

“Accounts are an awful bother,” Carl chipped in.

“We waste so much time,” said Barnes. “We waste so much time in
details. When all is said and done what is a peck of potatoes?”

“Never cared for potatoes,” vouchsafed Carl.

“Where would our accounts be if we permitted such slipshod methods as
yours?” Aunt Philomela challenged Barnes.

“Lord, they’d be always as they are,” he replied lightly. “I’ve noticed
that if you’ll allow it, your creditors do all the figuring for you.”

“For themselves rather,” snapped Aunt Philomela.

“It comes to the same in the end,” he opined.

“Even so, it’s just as well to retard the process.”

“The sooner they get it, the less they trouble you.”

“Then where would you be?” she demanded.

“You’d be in the hole,” nodded Carl.

“Lord, you’d be just where you were to start with,” Barnes affirmed
grandly. “Creditors can’t disturb _you_. They can only get your money.”

“That may be all very well for an artist,” Aunt Philomela answered
darkly, as though at best artists were but jail-birds.

Carl was devouring his portion of the trout with evident relish.

“You’re a great fisherman, Joe,” he complimented.

“Thank you.”

Barnes turned back to Aunt Philomela.

“Artists are human,” he declared, “perhaps a little more human than
other humans.”

Miss Van Patten put in a word.

“I don’t see why artists are always placed in a class by themselves.”

“Quite right,” agreed Barnes. “The distinction is a purely arbitrary
one. If there is any class, it belongs to the others--to the
green-grocer and his peck of potatoes.”

“You’re an artist then?” inquired Carl in surprise.

Barnes himself was a bit surprised.

“All honest men are artists,” he replied vaguely.

“And all honest men keep their accounts,” stuck in Aunt Philomela.

“If they have any to keep. I doubt if strictly honest men have any.”

“Are you a Socialist?” inquired Carl.

“No. I keep an account with myself. If I don’t use figures, why I lie
awake longer at night.”

“And don’t care whether you come out right or not,” snapped Aunt
Philomela.

“Your true artist cares more than anyone else in the world how he comes
out,” he answered soberly.

“But the potatoes--”

“The potatoes. When all is said and done what is a peck of potatoes? I
am like Mr. Langdon, I don’t care for them.”

“But you aren’t like me about trout. You don’t seem to care for trout.”

“I enjoy catching them at least. Perhaps I’m like my sister in that.”

He turned to Miss Van Patten.

“Oh!” she exclaimed, “I’ve been hopelessly beaten in my own waters.”

“I suppose you had plenty of sport in Alaska,” broke in Carl.

“In Alaska?” answered Barnes absent-mindedly.

“With four fingered William,” Aunt Philomela hastily reminded him.

“Oh, yes. Of course.”

“Polar bear and--such things?” persisted Carl.

“Exactly. Polar bear and such things.”

There was a long pause. Barnes stubbornly refused to expound. Miss Van
Patten came to the rescue. She asked Carl about the new song he was
composing. That answered through the dessert, but with the cheese and
coffee Carl turned once more upon Barnes.

“I suppose you had a rough time of it where you came from. Nothing like
this, was it?”

“Where I came from--no.”

“Snow everywhere I suppose. Nothing green?”

“From the house where I lived, you couldn’t see a sprig of green,”
Barnes answered truthfully.

“Jove, it must be a desolate country.”

“Ghastly.”

“And everyone grubbing for gold, eh?”

“Every mother’s son doing nothing else. Night and day; day and night.
It’s all they think of--where I came from.”

“Must be depressing.”

“It’s killing.”

Aunt Philomela was following every word breathlessly. The girl, too,
held herself ready to rush into the breach should there be need.

“You didn’t like it then?” asked Carl.

“No. That’s why I left.”

“I suppose a lot of men don’t get much out of it even after putting up
with all the hardships.”

“Nothing. I know a man who has cleaned up two million dollars without
getting anything out of it.”

“Jove. A friend of yours?”

“A sort of friend,” answered Barnes.

He referred to his father. What _had_ he got out of it? He was tied
hand and foot in a gingerbread apartment house. His two million had
never given him an hour like that by the trout-brook.

“I suppose,” suggested Carl, “it’s the spell that makes them stand
it--a sort of mountain Lorelei.”

Barnes started.

“That wouldn’t make a bad theme for an opera,” mused Carl.

Barnes turned to him with renewed interest.

“Have you ever done anything in that line?” he asked.

A new light came into Langdon’s face at the question.

“Not yet.”

“You hope to?”

Langdon flushed boyishly.

“This summer has made me hope,” he answered quietly.

Aunt Philomela rose. Out of a full heart Barnes silently thanked her.

“I suppose you two will practice to-night?” she asked her niece.

Barnes waited for the answer. Miss Van Patten turned to Carl.

“I’d like to,” he answered, “but I promised Dr. Merriweather to play to
him after supper.”

Barnes no longer begrudged him the brook-trout. When shortly after Carl
took his departure Barnes felt actually glad that he had been the
humble means of furnishing him so good a supper.

“Let’s go out and see the after-glow,” he suggested as standing on the
door step with Miss Van Patten, he saw Carl turn the corner, by the
letter-box.

She was upon the point of hesitating when he led the way in so
determined a manner that after throwing a shawl about her shoulders,
she followed. He trampled a trail through the knee-deep grass to the
summit in the rear of the house. Below them lay a sweep of undulating
hills unbroken to the horizon line.

At the edge of the world a mass of clouds impersonated the
Alps--towering to an impressive height above the purple hills. Their
whiteness was tinted with pink and one of them burned with a ghostly
fire. Above these, in flat strips, lay ribbons of old-rose and
greenish-yellow, while still higher the sky was a golden haze. For a
moment they stared in silence at the gorgeous picture. Then he declared,

“That looks like Alaska.”

“It’s hard for me to realize that you haven’t really been in Alaska,”
she said. “You make it all so vivid.”

“I’m willing to let my proxy attend to the actuality,” he answered,
“but I thank him for transferring his dreams to me.”

“I’m afraid Joe never dreamed very beautifully. The dreams are all your
own.”

“He must have dreamed some,” he mused, “or he wouldn’t have undertaken
the journey.”

“He dreamed of gold, perhaps.”

“Well, a dream is always a dream. There’s some good in a man who will
go adventuring even for gold.”

“But the object of the quest makes some difference,” she insisted.

“Undoubtedly. Though not as much as you would think. It’s the way a man
handles the obstacles to his quest that counts.”

“Then for that matter a man might go adventuring in his own house,” she
suggested.

“Or along a country road.”

“Because,” she explained, “there are obstacles everywhere.”

“It would be a dull world without them. Your greatest adventurer after
all is a child. De Soto never ran the gauntlet of half the thrilling
hazards that confront an infant in his toddling course from the nursery
to the garden-gate. And if the gate is a-swing and he is successful in
reaching the saffron road, he has before him an open field that might
well make Pizarro pause and gasp.”

“You almost tempt one to start upon a quest,” she laughed.

“You’ve probably already started,” he affirmed. “Everyone starts as
soon as he finds his feet.”

“But the joy of it lies in the consciousness of it,” she suggested.

“Exactly.”

He was silent for a moment. Their eyes met at a focus point in the
fiery clouds at the edge of the earth.

“Next to children, lovers are your true adventurers,” he declared.

She offered no opinion upon this, but turned her head a little to the
right, away from him. The sunset appeared in her cheeks.

“Your true lover,” he went on, pursuing his own fancy, “when footing
the soft grass of a country lane is, in reality, blazing a trail
through the tangled everglades of Florida. He is in search of the
Fountain of Youth. He is on a voyage of discovery as momentous as that
of Columbus for he, too, is after a new world. Your lover, even at
home, is ever challenging the rugged heights of Alaska in search of
hidden gold.”

She kept her eyes fixed upon the burning West.

“And the dangers he faces?”

“My soul, the dangers!” exclaimed Barnes. “The dangers are innumerable
and terrifying. If he stumbles on so much as a phrase, he is plunged
into a chasm of despair a mile deep. On every side he is confronted by
icy glaciers of reserve that half hide the stars in his firmament. If
he swerve one whit from the straight path, he is involved in a tangle
of misunderstandings. Hostile Indians of the tribe Jaloux attack him
at every point. If he move too fast, he is torn to shreds by rebuking
thorns; if he go too slow, he perishes and no one mourns. Fever
and thirst and heart-hunger are his. In ambush lie shaggy bears of
prejudices, wild hyenas of relatives, and--”

“Don’t,” she laughed uneasily, “you quite frighten one.”

“This falling in love is no small matter,” he avowed.

“You would not think then that so many men would venture.”

“You would not think that so many men would go to sea in boats; you
would not think that so many men would go to wars; you would not think
that so many men would try to paint.”

The sky was like a burnished gold floor; was like the yellow sand
that lies below Indian waters. The world looked marvelously serene to
her. And yet she felt as though the West were calling her. It was as
though a soft hand had suddenly been put within hers and were tenderly
drawing her towards the sunset. When she turned back to the house, it
was as though she were turning away from something. The brick house
looming before her in the dusk gave less a promise of shelter than of
restriction. The walls which had always given her a peaceful sense of
security, now appeared more like those of a retaining castle. It is an
odd illusion which can turn a fortress into a prison. It is equaled
only by that which turns a prison into a fortress.

It is small wonder that it leaves a maiden thoughtful. It is small
wonder that so slight a matter as the closing of an old Dutch door
behind her, is enough to bring her heart up into her throat.




CHAPTER XII

STRATEGY AND GEOGRAPHY


Barnes’ position in the library was a strategic one. It gave him an
excuse for not venturing out on so fair a morning, after his usual hour
with Mr. Van Patten; it saved him from the necessity of lounging in the
sitting-room and so revealing too obviously his object in remaining
indoors; and it afforded him a point of vantage to intercept Miss
Van Patten from time to time as she passed up and downstairs on her
important housewifely missions. Incidentally it gave him time to muse
and still more incidentally to acquire a variety of statistics which he
hoped to use this evening as defense guns in the assault he anticipated
from Dr. Merriweather on his none too impregnable position. For Aunt
Philomela had astounded them both by announcing that she had asked the
doctor to dinner that evening. So far, Barnes had been successful in
evading the man, for from all he had heard he would find it no easy
matter to hoodwink this big-hearted country doctor.

He made his first sortie as Miss Van Patten passed the door on her
way with orders to the cook. She wore a small white apron as finely
embroidered as a muslin kerchief. In her hand she held a pad and
pencil. Any one could see with half a glance that she had no time to
waste.

“Oh, Eleanor,” he exclaimed, rushing out.

At sound of her name she grew confused and stopped as short as though
an emergency brake had been applied.

“I beg your pardon,” he stammered, not realizing until then the
impetuosity of his attack. “I beg your pardon, but Alaska contains five
hundred and eighty-six thousand square miles.”

“Really?”

“I thought you ought to know.”

“Perhaps I’d better write it down.”

She scribbled it on the top of her pad and later amazed the cook by
ordering five hundred and eighty-six thousand pounds of roast.

“It’s a surprising fact, isn’t it?” he exclaimed.

It certainly had surprised her if that is what he meant.

“I didn’t know Alaska was so large,” she admitted.

“Nor I. But it is. You can see it here on the map.”

He hurried back to the map and standing over it pointed
melodramatically in such a way that one could not help but examine
unless one wished to appear rude.

“It goes from here to here and here to here,” he explained as she came
nearer. “It was bought from Russia for seven million, two hundred
dollars. The deal proved that the nation had become essentially Yankee.
I think some of my ancestors must have been mixed up in it.”

“Your father is a business man?”

“The apotheosis of a business man. He reckons his age in fiscal years.
Business to his life is what the cook-stove is to the kitchen; it warms
and feeds him. Take it away and the world would contain nothing but
useless pots and kettles and a few raw materials. The only concession
he makes to Art is to put a scroll upon the cook-stove door. It was
from that scroll that I received my own humble inclination towards Art.”

“I’m afraid your father would think you wasting your time here,” she
said anxiously.

“My father thinks I waste all my time,” he assured her. “But that is
because he doesn’t know. I rather think he would give me credit for
doing a little better than usual at present.”

“I wish it were possible to return to him your kindness to my father.”

“Perhaps,” he faltered, “the opportunity will come.”

“If it would,” she cried eagerly.

“I’ll let you know if it does,” he replied.

She raised her eyes to his. Then she lowered them. For a fraction of a
second she felt as she had when the Dutch door closed upon her.

“I’m beginning to marvel,” he mused, “how often the little incidents
of life turn out to be the big ones. Every decision we make is like
drawing at straws held in the hand of Fate. The ends are all even and
we can’t tell until afterwards--years afterwards, perhaps--whether we
have drawn the short straw or the long straw.”

Without at all thinking what she was about, she wrote upon her pad,
“Long straw.”

“And we draw,” he concluded, “every minute of our lives.”

While her eyes were lowered upon the paper (she was working a scroll
about the sentence) he leaned forward a little. Three days ago Fate had
held out to him two straws; one was the road to the next village, the
other was the road to this house. He had drawn, he thought, the short
one, but was it so? Was it so?

“You make life seem such a breathless affair,” she was saying.

“It is such a wonderful affair,” he answered.

“It had always seemed to me here rather humdrum.”

“And now?”

“The sunsets,” she faltered, “the sunsets are such nesting-places of
fancies.”

“So is everywhere; so is this old library.”

“But the kitchen,” she put in quickly, “is a place of stern realities.
I must go at once.”

No one could leave more abruptly when her mind was upon it. Before he
had gathered his wits together she had gone.

“It is,” he determined with a sigh, “the curse of the cook-stove. The
Acme has worked its spell again.”

With the map before him, he settled himself to explore more in detail
this new country which lay immediately before him. In this the map
itself did not help him except to afford a convenient resting-place for
his elbows.

It was clear to him now that he had inadvertently stumbled upon
the center of the universe. It was rather odd that geographers had
neglected to point out so significant a feature. To the north lay the
North, to the south lay the South, to the east the East, to the west
the West. Start in any direction, continue in a straight line, and one
would come back here. It was a demonstrable fact. He had no doubt that
even if one pursued a circuitous and zigzag path, the result would be
the same. One could no more escape it than can the compass the magnetic
north. Had he himself not reached this point over that devious winding
course which started at his cradle?

He heard her footsteps and charged his guns with another fact.

“Do you know,” he announced as she approached the library door on her
way back upstairs, “do you know that Alaska is approximately as large
as all the United States east of the Mississippi river, if we subtract
the areas of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina,
and West Virginia?”

“Really?” she observed again.

“I suppose,” he reflected, “that if you subtracted some more, it would
then be twice as large as something else.”

“I suppose they wish to make it look as large as they can,” she
remarked.

“You can see it on the map,” he urged.

He crossed the room to the atlas and she had nothing to do again but
follow.

“All that pink space,” he announced as grandly as though he owned it.

“How interesting,” she murmured.

“There are a great many facts in a geography,” he declared, “which
aren’t generally known.”

“There are certainly a great many facts about Alaska which even
geographers don’t know,” she laughed.

“Also about this place. Geographers are very ignorant.”

“You didn’t expect to find Chester on the map.”

“But I _did_ find it,” he avowed.

“You did? May I see it?”

“Certainly. Take my place here.”

She seated herself in his chair and leaned forward expectantly.

“Now,” he instructed, “rest your elbows on the atlas and close your
eyes.”

“Oh,” she exclaimed in confusion at having fallen into his trap.

“One understands geography a great deal better with you in the room,”
he confessed.

“But I shouldn’t be in the room,” she cried. “I was on my way to Aunt.”

She rose at once, but this time he covered her retreat.

“Have you written down what I just told you?” he asked.

“I don’t think I shall write down any more,” she answered, remembering
the mistake she had made to the cook.

She was almost as tall as he and yet he could not see her eyes.

“Aunt is waiting for me,” she explained.

“That is a safe statement to make at any time, isn’t it?”

“But this is very important; I am to see about the dusting.”

“I don’t believe you can find any dust in the house.”

“But it is necessary to dust just the same.”

“Just as one prays when there isn’t anything to pray about,” he
suggested.

“Or talks when there isn’t anything to talk about,” she answered.

Whereupon he promptly stood aside and allowed her to pass.

At the door she turned.

“I didn’t mean that,” she apologized. “I’d stay if--”

He moved towards her. She ran upstairs.

It seemed an eternity before she appeared again. He hurried to the door.

“Alaska has a population of thirty-five thousand white people,” he
announced. “There are a lot of us up there.”

She was armed with a feather duster.

“I am to do the library,” she made the much more significant
announcement. “The servants are all busy.”

“There is nothing like giving the servants a great deal of work,” he
declared enthusiastically.

“While I’m doing this,” she remarked, “you may instruct me about
Alaska.”

She moved at once upon the book-case. Her arms were guarded by
sleeve-protectors of a pink and white apple-blossom design.

“You mustn’t think,” he made a beginning, “that gold is the only
interest there. In the fiscal year of 1908 the merchandise shipments
alone amounted to roughly twenty-six million, eight hundred and
seventy-five thousand, three hundred and seventy-three dollars.”

“What is a fiscal year?” she inquired.

“The sorriest of all years; the twelve month space between dollar
marks. I don’t remember that I ever had one.”

“I think Aunt Philomela must have them. I forgot to tell you that her
accounts came out right, in the end.”

“I had no doubt they would,” he said.

He watched her a moment.

“I wonder just what the economic value of stirring up dust is,” he
mused.

She turned upon him.

“You don’t want your library to look as though you never used it, do
you?”

“One might use a library,” he suggested, “without ever disturbing the
books.”

“It is a convenient place to practice in,” she admitted.

“Oh. Are you to practice your duets to-day?”

“I wrote Carl that I should be too busy. And he wished to play me his
new song.”

“At first I should have said it was impossible for him to write a song,
but now--I think I see how he does it.”

“He has a great deal of talent.”

“I liked the way his eyes lighted up at thought of a possible opera,”
he admitted frankly.

“He says he can’t think of you as a business man,” she laughed.

“Why not?”

“Because,” she faltered, “he says--you inspire him.”

“I?”

She nodded.

“But say--that’s odd. I wonder how _I_ inspire him?”

“He says you make him see the tragedy of those men up North. He says--”
she hesitated.

“Well?”

“He said he thought you must have had some big tragedy in your own
life.”

“Of what nature?” he inquired with interest.

“Some big disappointment.”

She appeared confused.

“Of what nature?” he persisted.

“Oh, I shouldn’t have told you. I don’t suppose I ought.”

He looked thoughtful.

“Some disappointment in love?” he questioned.

She nodded.

He drew a deep breath.

“Well,” he said, “he’s wrong.”

“Yes?” she asked indifferently.

“Absolutely. It may be in store for me, but it hasn’t come yet.”

“We can’t any of us tell what is in store for us,” she said quickly.

“No. It might be in store for him, too, mightn’t it?”

“For Carl?”

“I hope not,” he said soberly. “I think that must be the biggest
possible tragedy in anyone’s life.”

“So it isn’t very safe to go adventuring, is it?” she suggested.

“Safe? No. But it isn’t much of a man who won’t--for all that.”

“I have finished my dusting,” she announced, suddenly moving towards
the door.

“No,” he protested. “You oughtn’t to neglect those books in the corner.”

“You said they didn’t matter.”

“I have changed my mind.”

“Anyhow I can’t waste any more time.”

“Waste? Waste?” he exclaimed.

But she had gone.




CHAPTER XIII

A SURPRISE


Promptly at seven the candles were lighted upon the dinner-table where
they burned in sacrificial splendor in the midst of an offering fit
for Ceres. At seven one, Aunt Philomela swept in gowned in purple
silk, resplendent in the family jewels; at seven five Miss Van Patten
appeared and put the family jewels to shame. She was in something as
light as mist. It fell from her neck and hung like spray about her
ankles. At seven ten the doctor’s gig drove up and a hearty “Whoa”
announced the doctor himself like a bugle blast. At seven fifteen, the
preliminary embarrassment of the introduction was over and Barnes’ back
smarting under the gruff greeting. At seven twenty the doctor returned
from a brief visit upstairs and John produced himself in the majesty of
full regalia.

It was not until the soup was served that Barnes found himself in a
position to size up the genial enemy. Among other reasons he was too
elated over the necessity that had forced Aunt Philomela to seat him
opposite her niece. Barnes saw a heavy man of sixty with a round
tanned face, and hands of remarkable beauty. They were tender hands
backed by arms that might have been those of a Flemish warrior. In
a dozen ways the bluff doctor made him think of those who fought in
Flanders and secured immortality, not so much by their deeds, strangely
enough, as by the canvases of those who depicted them. The burly
physician might have been the result of some subtle blending of the
poet artist and his warrior model; of the brush and the sword. Give
him a rolling hat with a feather in it, and he could take his place
beside Porthos; put a brush in his hand and he would have passed
for Rembrandt. At the sick bed of children the women gave over,
unquestioning, the joy of their travail to those hands--recognizing
them as even more tender than their own.

It took but a glance to see what he must mean to the country-side. No
ice-laden wind which ever blew would be strong enough to stand between
him and a cry of pain or the moan of a fevered soul. It was enough if
he himself came; it did not so much matter whether he brought his vials
or no.

Barnes found the situation more disconcerting than he had anticipated.
His self-confidence deserted him. He had no heart to play upon this
big man’s credulity. Rather would he take him into his confidence;
rather would he speak fairly to those blue eyes resting in their nest
of wrinkles. Here was a man used to seeing the unshrouded souls of his
fellows. He was doctor, priest, and lawyer, and when these three get
together in one man there is a great dropping off of cloaking rags.
Such a man must see terrible things; at times beautiful things.

“Boy,” exclaimed the doctor, “you’ve done more for your father in three
days than I’ve been able to do in three months. You ought to have come
a year ago.”

“If I’d known what I now know I _would_ have come,” answered Barnes.

Aunt Philomela glanced up sharply. But she was not in her usual spirit.
Her heart was in her mouth.

“When a man gets old he clings to his own,” declared the doctor. “It is
as natural as for youth to reach for the new.”

“At any age,” opined Aunt Philomela, “there is nothing like one’s own
flesh and blood.”

“Not so,” objected the doctor, “if my son didn’t stand by his
sweetheart against me I’d disown him.”

Barnes felt his heart warming towards this man at once.

“There’s Carl,” pursued the doctor with a wink at Eleanor, “he’s
reaching out--reaching out.”

Barnes turned to his soup.

“That is different,” answered Aunt Philomela.

The doctor swallowed his soup red hot.

“Boy,” he broke out, “you have been where I would go if I were thirty
years younger. I’ve too many children here to look after or I might go
now. Tell me about the place.”

Barnes glanced up. John had stepped into the kitchen.

“You refer to Alaska?” he asked quietly.

“Alaska,” answered the doctor.

“I have never been there in my life,” was Barnes’ astounding reply.

For a moment there was that stillness which presages the hurricane; a
hush of such intensity that it seemed as though the inanimate objects
participated--a silence so close as to be stifling. Then Aunt Philomela
dropped her spoon. The girl started. The doctor’s brows contracted.
Barnes sipped his soup.

“Perhaps I did not understand you,” hazarded Dr. Merriweather.

“I said I have never been in Alaska in my life,” Barnes repeated in as
matter of fact a tone as he might have commented on the weather.

The doctor turned to Miss Schuyler. The latter could not have
pronounced her own name.

“Then,” inquired the doctor, “am I to understand that you’re an
impostor?”

“Nothing else,” admitted Barnes, “but,” he added, anxiously glancing
towards the buttery, “you mustn’t let the servants know.”

“Perhaps you’re not even Mr. Van Patten’s son?”

“I am no relation whatever,” confessed Barnes.

“Eleanor,” gasped Aunt Philomela weakly.

The girl turned and smiled upon her. After the first shock, she
strangely enough was the only composed one of the group. She was not
only composed but elated.

“Let me explain,” begged Barnes, facing the doctor squarely. “After
all, it’s a simple ruse; the boy Joe would not come, and so to save Mr.
Van Patten from the shock of this news, I volunteered. The deceit has
worked perfectly; he suspects nothing, and is, as you saw, a happy man.”

“Well,” muttered the doctor, “so that explains it.”

His face began to brighten and continued until it had expanded into a
broad grin. With this expression he again confronted Aunt Philomela,
whose cheeks had turned a fiery red.

“Aunty Schuyler,” he declared, “I didn’t think it was in you.”

“I know that it--it was contemptible, but I--I couldn’t help it,” she
faltered.

“Contemptible!” he exploded. “It’s great!”

He turned to Barnes and stretched out his big arm across the table.

“Boy, your hand upon it!”

Barnes seized the hand, and that firm grip, if nothing else, made it
seem all worth while.

“Aunt Philomela--” began Barnes, still anxious to absolve Miss Schuyler.

But the doctor interrupted him with a loud laugh. He threw back his
head and laughed as he had not laughed in twenty years.

“She told me a yarn that was pretty hard to swallow,” he roared, “but,
Lord, it was a good one.”

“Don’t,” she pleaded.

“She told me about Billy who had lost four fingers, and--”

“Le voilà,” interrupted Barnes, swinging upon Aunt Philomela, “I warned
you to be accurate.”

Miss Van Patten reached under the table and found Aunt Philomela’s
trembling hand.

“And you made it all up as you went along?” demanded the doctor, the
tears starting in his eyes. “You did it off hand?”

“No,” broke in Barnes. “Truly she must be exonerated. She only repeated
what I told her. She was quite forced into it.”

“Don’t spoil it,” pleaded the doctor, waving him back. “Don’t take her
laurels! I’ve told her often enough that the only thing she lacked was
imagination.”

But at this moment John entered, and Barnes raised a warning finger to
his lips.

“Don’t let John know. It might get upstairs.”

“Mum’s the word,” agreed the doctor, trying hard to stifle his chuckles.

He whispered across the table,

“Aunty Schuyler--after dinner--more! More!”

But Barnes saw that it was high time to check the merriment. The little
old lady looked to be upon the point of leaving. She took the situation
far too seriously. So he deftly turned the doctor away from the subject
to a theme he had long since discovered to be a vital one in the
country,--the rights of automobiles on country roads.

“If I had my way,” the doctor exploded, rising to the bait at once,
“I’d fine ’em a hundred dollars for going over four miles an hour.”

“But in your profession you find them useful?” inquired Barnes, though
he knew from the way the doctor had shouted “Whoa” as he entered the
yard that he was too loyal to his horse to admit such slander.

“Bah! D’ye think I’d risk my patient’s life to say nothing of my own
in one of the things? When I start I want to be sure of getting there.
What d’ye think I’d have done last night at Mrs. Van Dusen’s with only
a minute to spare?”

Aunt Philomela glanced up with interest.

“A boy,” he informed her.

Her eyes warmed.

Barnes drew him on further to tell of some of the cases in the
neighborhood in which Aunt Philomela was interested. This turned out
to be an inexhaustible theme and revealed the fact that in the work of
relief organization Aunt Philomela was the doctor’s good right arm.
The two of them were evidently a self-appointed board of charities
for the village. Aunt Philomela lost herself in the discussion, so
that her spirits soon revived again. In fact, with the weight of the
secret off her mind, she appeared even more vivacious than usual, which
left Barnes, although still obliged to listen attentively with his
eyes, free to follow his own thoughts. And Miss Van Patten, though she
apparently hung upon every word that was spoken, was no less free to
pursue the trend of her own thoughts. And both were conscious that
each was doing this.

There are blessed limits as to how far this matter of chaperonage may
be carried. Given two people well in tune with one another and it is
doubtful if it amounts to very much. There are instances of two who, at
opposite ends of a crowded church, have successfully found one another,
and in consequence heard but little of the sermon. There are those who,
in the midst of a vast crowd with the band playing and people huzzaing,
have felt themselves as secluded as in a country lane.

It is certain that Barnes found himself conversing quite freely with
her who, leaning forward, was giving such attention to her aunt. No
words were spoken, to be sure, for there was no need of words.

“You appear more beautiful to-night than I’ve ever seen you,” he began
boldly, if silently.

“What has that to do with the matter?” she answered without moving her
lips.

Barnes for the moment felt venturesome.

“As an artist,” was his reply, “it’s my duty to take such details into
account. Your eyes match marvelously well with the candle light.”

“Your calling doesn’t give you the privilege of being bold.”

“So long as the boldness is born of truth. Your hair, too, is as a
thousand candles burning in the night.”

“You are thinking of my mother’s hair.”

“Because I see your hair as your father saw your mother’s hair when the
two were young.”

“Father was pleased by the tender way you spoke to him of mother.”

“My heart was dangerously tender as through you I saw your mother.”

“You think of danger--ever?”

“I fear at times, but I cannot tell whether it is for myself or for
you.”

“What is there to fear for me?”

“I wish you would answer that yourself.”

“I cannot. You must answer all questions you ask of me.”

“Aye, and they must be answered before they are asked. But I will ask
one;--what makes your cheeks so red just now?”

“Because the blood mounts high in them.”

“Whence comes the blood?”

“From the heart, to be sure.”

“The heart must be over eager. Why is that?”

“That is a question for Dr. Merriweather.”

“He might know more about it than most doctors. But when all is said
and done what a pitiful little your surgeon knows about the heart.”

“What a pitiful little anyone knows,” she answered.

The hum of the doctor’s talk went on. Barnes, as he watched the girl,
caught her gaze.

“I wonder what sort of a picture you are painting of me?” he asked. “I
see you dipping the brush of your long lashes into the pigment of your
eyes.”

“You may be sure that whatever it is, it is not for exhibition.”

“I should be half afraid to view it, if it were.”

“Doubtless you would criticise it. But it is not half done.”

“Sometimes one best catches the truth in a half-finished work.”

“Not as a maid paints.”

“How does a maid paint?”

“Backwards. She paints her picture and then rubs out and out until
sometimes she has nothing left.”

“And if the likeness is good at the start?”

“Then it stands. But there are many mutilated pictures in a maid’s
gallery.”

“And how does mine progress?”

“So far as you may pierce the gallery windows you may see.”

“But your eyes are such loop-holes. One has to be within to see well
from them.”

“You must win your own position.”

“A soldier’s privilege is mine?”

“The soldier’s privilege is every man’s.”

“Then, by my soul, I’ll--”

Aunt Philomela was rising from the table. How was that? He had no
memory of the intermediate courses.

“You agree, boy?” demanded Dr. Merriweather.

“Oh, certainly,” faltered Barnes, “I agree heartily.”




CHAPTER XIV

OUTSIDE THE DUTCH DOOR


Before leaving, Dr. Merriweather found an opportunity to draw Barnes
one side.

“Boy,” he said, “I didn’t realize until to-night to how great an extent
Mr. Van Patten’s condition is due to his mental state. He is already
wonderfully improved.”

“You mean you think there is now hope for him?”

“I don’t want to put it too strongly--but there’s a chance.”

“You’ve told the others?”

“No. We’ll wait a while before we do that. But I wanted you to know and
to thank you.”

They were in the dark. The doctor struck a match for his cigar. As the
match flickered down, he smiled a little.

“You’ll reap your reward for this somewhere,” he concluded.

After the doctor had gone and the three were alone again, Aunt
Philomela confronted Barnes.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to confess the truth to Dr.
Merriweather?”

“Because I didn’t know it myself until I saw him.”

“You placed me in a very embarrassing position.”

“I thought to rescue you from one,” exclaimed Barnes with concern.

“After I had repeated to him that mess of stuff you told me!”

“But my wish was to save you from further committing yourself.”

“You had no business getting me into the pickle.”

“It was quite by accident.”

“That is always a young man’s plea. I saw these complications coming
from the first. Deceit never succeeds.”

“On the contrary, this has succeeded perfectly,” Barnes protested. “I’m
quite sure the doctor thinks none the worse of us.”

“He’ll never believe another word I say,” complained Aunt Philomela.

“And will trust you in delicate matters as never before,” affirmed
Barnes.

“To tell him was the only honorable thing to do,” broke in Miss Van
Patten.

“Then why don’t you tell Carl?” Aunt Philomela challenged.

And with this shot Aunt Philomela promptly withdrew before the enemy
could fire back, forgetting, however, that she was deserting her most
important outpost in so doing. Barnes could scarcely believe his good
fortune as he saw her skirts switch upstairs.

“Well,” he sighed in relief, “that is over.”

“Aunt really quite approves,” breathed the girl.

“Of course she does,” he agreed.

“But she is probably waiting for me,” she added.

“That gives me the strategical position,” he declared cheerfully.

“You should be in the army,” she commented with heightened color.

“What’s the use when you have given me the soldier’s privilege?”

“I?” she exclaimed in astonishment.

“At dinner,” he reminded her.

“I don’t remember,” she murmured, trying hard to recollect the
conversation.

“When I spoke of the picture you are painting.”

“You must have been talking to yourself,” she declared with sudden
light.

“So you were, too!” he challenged.

She appeared startled. He realized that this was a good guess.

“You said I looked more like a soldier than an artist,” he asserted,
making a still wilder guess.

She drew back a little now in genuine consternation.

“Oh, you shouldn’t read one’s thoughts,” she protested.

She looked very tall and dark and beautiful.

“That is as far as I can go,” he admitted reluctantly.

“It is as far as you have any right to go,” she said hurriedly.

“You see I talked to you all the while the doctor talked to Aunt
Philomela.”

“Really?” she asked.

The Princess stalked in and, glad of the relief, she picked up the
handsome cat. She herself looked like a princess out of a story-book.

“You answered all my questions very evasively,” he complained.

“Perhaps they were not proper questions,” she suggested as she stroked
the silken back of the other princess.

“They were somewhat direct,” he admitted.

“There are some things it is very much wiser to keep to oneself,” she
affirmed, looking up sharply at him.

Again he saw a resemblance between her eyes and the night sky over the
orchard.

“There are some things in which that matter of so-called wisdom does
not enter at all,” he returned.

“In that case caution should prompt us.”

“Caution is but a lame dog yelping at the heels of Wisdom. Shall I tell
you what we discussed?”

She hesitated. There was that about him to-night which bewildered her.
He was less a stranger. Perhaps it was the drowsy night; perhaps it was
the fact that they stood here for the first time alone, with the dark
closing about them. There seemed less to fear in him, more to fear in
herself. She answered:

“I think you had better not.”

“Well,” he submitted reluctantly, “perhaps my conversation _was_ in
the nature of a confidential communication to myself. Yet it is almost
impossible for me to believe you did not actually share it.”

It was still more difficult for her to resist the invitation to share
it now. The candle sputtering on its last quarter ate its course
voraciously as though in haste to blend this room with the rest of the
dark.

“There seems so much we cannot share with others,” she ventured.

“I never felt it as I do this moment,” he replied. “I think it must
be a wonderful experience to lead another through our own peculiar
treasure-house of memories. Out of the past we gather so many
things--alone; beautiful things, so precious and fine that we hide them
deep within ourselves lest the light of merely curious eyes should
fade them. Perhaps some of us have partly shared them with the world,
in pictures or in verse or in songs, but at best these are but feeble
copies. We haven’t done much but suggest their form and color or the
tune to which they are set. But some day along comes one--to share
them. Then we go back to the Thames, the Seine, and over the saffron
road to the Schuyler brook and take that other with us through all the
long galleries. So we know for the first time why we have stored them
all so carefully.”

Barnes paused. His eyes had grown distant. Her eyes had come nearer.
The cat purred contentedly.

“If I were to make a definition of happiness,” he concluded, “it would
be this; the privilege of sharing utterly.”

She knew. She had her own treasures--her own gallery. But it had never
occurred to her that any other should ever see them. These pictures
were to be kept tight locked forever. They were to be reviewed even by
her only when alone in the dark with the rest of the world tight asleep
around her. And now he had made her feel that after all her greatest
joy might come in showing them to another. She looked up to find his
eyes upon her. They were so brilliant and yet so gentle that they made
her fear lest even now they might pierce too deep.

“We may share most things,” she hastened to speak, “but always there
will be something left for ourselves alone, won’t there?”

“Most always,” he admitted.

They had remained standing. She leaned back now against the door frame.

“Won’t you sit down?” he pleaded.

“No! Oh, no!” she objected quickly.

But he brought a chair and with a smile placed it near the door, as
though to assure her of an easy line of retreat. She passed it, and
crossing the room sat near the window.

“When making definitions,” he continued, seating himself near the
other window, “we have for once an opportunity to speak without
equivocation. In reality, things go no further than ‘most always.’
We seldom attain the absolute. But,” he added, lowering his voice
a little, “I believe that it’s possible in that one thing which I
defined as ‘sharing utterly.’ I believe that once we may live up to our
definition. I believe it is within us all to share once--utterly and
without quibbling.”

“It doesn’t _seem_ possible,” she answered weakly.

“No. But it is.”

“I should think it would be quite confusing.”

“I should think it would be quite dizzily clarifying.”

“Isn’t that the same mental condition?” she laughed timidly.

“The difference is the difference in the effect produced by champagne
and the effect produced by mountain air,” he stated.

“I suppose some such freedom is what we all strive for,” she said
quickly, with broad generalization.

“There is but little striving in it,” he affirmed. “It is the one time
when the mountain comes to Mahomet.”

“But even then Mahomet must climb the mountain,” she suggested.

“He soars to the top, winged,” he answered.

The candle began to give warning. The unsnuffed wick leaned over
drunkenly and unfairly ate down its sides. But a candle may not be
criticised, however unjust its acts. Barnes saw that it was too late
to correct its knavish course though the evening was still young; in
two minutes it would unceremoniously snuff out the girl’s eyes. It gave
fair warning.

Miss Van Patten arose. He had nothing to do but to arise also.

“I shall emulate Mahomet,” he declared. “I shall soar to the top of the
stairs, winged.”

She answered only,

“Good-night.”

But the simple words set his pulse to beating faster. There was in them
something of the ’cello note.

He bowed as she passed before him. She hurried on to Aunt Philomela,
and he crossed to the candle and blew it out. He found that after all
the dark did not make so much difference.

Barnes made his way to the little Dutch door, opened it and stepped out
into the night. As he did so a man who was retreating down the path
turned and came back. It was Langdon.

“Hello!” he called. “I had hoped to catch you, but when I saw the light
go out, I thought you must have retired.”

“You wished to see me?” Barnes asked in surprise.

“You, Joe,” answered Langdon nervously. “You don’t mind if I call you
Joe?”

“Not at all,” answered Barnes, indifferently.

But the name instantly destroyed some beautiful dreams he had come out
there to dream.

He sat down on the stone step but Langdon remained standing.

“I thought,” Langdon began, “that as long as Mr. Van Patten is so ill
and you’re the man of the family now, I ought to come to you.”

“Yes,” answered Barnes in surprise.

Langdon faltered on.

“Since I’ve been down here this summer my music has meant more to me
than it ever did before. I’ve been able to express things through it.”

He paused.

“Your sister sort of makes a man understand,” he ventured.

Barnes drew a deep breath.

“What are you driving at?” he demanded.

“I’m trying to tell you,” answered Langdon, earnestly, “but I want you
to understand me first. I know how business men feel about music.”

“Business men?”

“They think music and such things are for women, don’t they? They
think Art doesn’t test you like gold hunting.”

“I suppose some do.”

“Well, it doesn’t--like gold hunting. It doesn’t make you muscular.
But for two years now I’ve stood in front of a mirror and drawn a bow
across a fiddle for eight hours, then stopped an hour, and done it
again. It isn’t easy to do that--all alone. It takes a sort of brawn,
doesn’t it?”

“I should think it might,” agreed Barnes.

“It’s been nothing but work up to now,” Langdon ran on. “I’ve just been
learning to play. I couldn’t see what it was leading to--until this
summer.”

“And now?” inquired Barnes.

“Now I’ve found out. Eleanor has made me see.”

Barnes ran his hand over his brow.

“Joe, she’s made me hope for big things; she’s filled my soul full of
big songs. Don’t you understand now?”

“You mean--you love her?”

Langdon came nearer and held out his hand.

“Yes,” he answered.

Barnes took his hand. The purple of the night sky turned to leaden
gray.

“Have you told her?” he asked.

“No. I--I thought I ought to tell you first. You know what a wonderful
creature she is.”

“Yes.”

“So--so I thought you ought to know something about the man who wants
to ask for her hand.”

“That’s very decent of you. But--I haven’t anything to say about it.”

“She thinks a great deal of you,” said Langdon.

Barnes did not answer.

“I don’t think she’d marry anyone you didn’t approve of,” Langdon
laughed nervously. “I never heard a sister admire her brother as she
does you.”

“Don’t!” gasped Barnes.

“Don’t?”

“You--you oughtn’t to repeat those things.”

“I’d almost be glad to be just her brother if she talked that way about
me.”

There was a long pause. Then Langdon resumed,

“Have I your permission to ask her?”

“_My_ permission?”

“If you’d rather, I’ll wait.”

Barnes took a long breath. Then he grasped Langdon’s hand again.

“No,” he said earnestly, “I don’t think I’d wait very long.”

“Thank you. And I may tell her I have your consent?”

Barnes smiled grimly.

“If you wish.”

Langdon gripped his hand once more. Barnes turned abruptly.

“You’ll excuse me? I’m going in now. Good-night.”

Barnes closed the little Dutch door behind him. And instead of soaring,
winged, to the top of the stairs, he plodded up as though he were
carrying a great weight upon his shoulders.




CHAPTER XV

PLAYING THE GAME


Barnes had said to Aunt Philomela when she demurred at certain things
running counter to her own convictions, “Now that we have begun this
game, we must play it for all it’s worth. We must stick it out to the
end.”

Lying there in his room on the little white bed, Barnes repeated that
again to himself. It meant just one thing; that in all fairness, he
must now play the brother in this household as well as the prodigal. He
had been admitted within these sacred precincts not as a friend, but as
an actor. Honor demanded that he must not presume further than this.
That was as clear as a June morning. To take advantage of his position
for any personal consideration would be to turn traitor to the old
gentleman, to Aunt Philomela, to the girl herself.

Well and good. There was no sense in arguing further along this line.
As a gentleman it did not behoove him to discuss it even with himself.
Looking then at Langdon’s suit impersonally, as a brother, how must he
consider it? Dr. Merriweather was a sufficient voucher for the man’s
social standing. What of the man himself? He had seen enough of him
to realize that he was clean-limbed, clean-hearted. He had also had a
glimpse into the man’s soul and had found there a brother artist.

Barnes sprang from the bed and taking a chair by the open window
inhaled the perfumed night breeze. He was tempted hard to throw this
whole matter from his mind, but he gripped himself. Langdon had said,
“She has filled my soul with song.”

And his own soul this same woman had filled with pictures. He saw down
the whole long gallery. There were the pictures by the Thames, by the
Seine, by the saffron road, and by the Schuyler brook. They waited but
the touch of her fingers upon his arm to spring into reality for all
the world to admire. Barnes was breathing rapidly. He checked himself.

There, too, in another heart were the songs. They waited but the
brush--of her lips--to be sung. It came hard to acknowledge that. His
ancestors, facing English guns, never did a harder thing.

Looking at the matter frankly then, as an artist as well as a brother,
there was no ground upon which he could contest Langdon’s right to
sue for this girl’s hand. There remained only his own man right to
fight for his life. But he could not avail himself of this except by
deserting this old gentleman--except by coming upon the field frankly
as an enemy. His thoughts continually went back to the army code; he
was here, as it were, upon parole. To abuse that position would be as
cowardly a thing as to fire upon a flag of truce.

It took Barnes four feverish hours to thresh out these manifest
truths, but when it was over he found himself in a state of curious
self-possession. He had never felt calmer in his life. But somehow this
room was not big enough for him; he felt the need of getting out where
there was nothing overhead between him and the stars, where to the
right and left he should be bounded only by the East and the West. He
had not undressed, so he stole out of the room, down the stairs and out
by the little Dutch door. It was odd how important a part, first and
last, this inanimate object had played in his life. It was this which
had first attracted him to the house; it was through this that he had
led her when they had gone to the hill-top together; hard by this that
Langdon had made his confession; and now it furnished him a temporary
means of escape from his prison.

Barnes made his way to the top of the hill. The air was cool, the sky
was deep, and below him, but the ghost of itself, lay the saffron
road. He studied it with grim interest. It was no longer a glad highway
through the King’s dominions and it no longer led on, but away. Even
the big atlas in the library had proven that in whatever direction he
might journey, it must always be away.

There was only one path now which offered him even a destination and
that was back to his mother. If it had been possible he would have
pushed on in the dark along this ghost road until he reached her. He
would like to sit in the park with her and talk over things. He strode
a half dozen steps down the hill. Then he came back. When the old
gentleman now sleeping so peacefully awoke, he would ask for his son.
The thin hands would fumble about for another hand and they must find
what they sought.

Barnes threw himself down flat and elbows on the ground rested his
chin in his hands. Below him in shadow lay all that vast unexplored
country upon which only yesterday he had gazed with her by his side.
To-night it was boundless--limitless. Where before it had seemed like a
virgin woodland, sun-lighted, it now seemed as somber as a Doré forest.
It would be a grim affair--adventuring through this land alone. The
pictures a man would bring back with him--Ah, they would be pictures of
Hell.

The dawn came softly, tenderly, and like evil before a good woman, the
shadows stole away. The dawn came just as Eleanor might come into a
room at dusk and light the candles. In the ivory East appeared the red
that was in her cheeks; in the black, lowhanging clouds, appeared the
gold that was in the black of her hair. A fierce desire for his paints
seized him. No one had ever pictured the dawn because no one before had
ever divined its secret. The dawn was Eleanor.

He heard footsteps behind and glancing around saw Langdon. The latter
paused, started, and then came on again. His face was alight and he
looked like one inspired.

“Joe,” he said half in awe, “to put that into music, you would have to
put Eleanor into music. Then--then--what a symphony you would have!”

Barnes sprang to his feet.

“Good God, man,” he cried, “what brought you to this spot?”

“Don’t you hear it?” persisted Langdon. “The world all dark and
cavernous--like those days in Paris; then her voice calling--far in
the distance; then a low morning song, like a morning prayer; then
her voice coming nearer until, in a wild medley of song, her presence
breaks upon the world and the world awakes--as a soul awakes.”

Standing very erect, his head back, Langdon faced the East.

And Barnes facing Langdon saw his picture fade--fade--until some demon
in him made him feel for a moment that it would be right for him to
battle with this man in defense of his own. How simple it would be if
here on this hill-top in the early morning the two might grapple until
one was left supreme. Langdon turned and caught a flash in the eyes of
this other which drove the music from his soul.

“What’s the matter?” he exclaimed. “You look feverish.”

Barnes did not answer for a moment. He very deliberately sat down. He
felt ashamed of this primeval instinct. If in the days to follow he
couldn’t show any better control over himself than this, he had better
find it out now.

“Sit down, Langdon,” he said. “What got you up so early?”

“The dawn,” answered Langdon.

As he seated himself, he took one swift look at Barnes’ face, but he
soon forgot whatever it was he had observed a second ago. He had more
vital things in mind than the passing mood of a prodigal.

“I couldn’t sleep,” he explained. “Somehow the fact of having spoken
to you made all the things I’ve been merely dreaming all this while
seem intensely real.”

“I wouldn’t let them be too real until--I had spoken to her.”

“I know,” Langdon answered quickly, “I don’t wish to presume. But a man
isn’t responsible for his unbidden thoughts, is he?”

“Who is?” asked Barnes.

“No one. No one--on earth.”

“But every man has to stand for himself--the consequences of his
thinking.”

“I’m willing to do that. But--well, I don’t suppose you realize how big
a part a woman plays in work of my sort.”

“I think I do.”

“She’s the very life of it.”

“The very life,” repeated Barnes.

“In business, it’s every man for himself; but in music you’ve got to
have someone to sing to, someone to play for.”

“What about the masters?”

“Oh, when a man’s a genius, it’s different. But when you’re just
human--well, that’s all I am and I’m glad of it. I don’t care for
lonely grandeur, Joe. I only want to climb as high as I can go with
Eleanor.”

“Good Lord,” exploded Barnes, “can a man go any higher than that?”

“I can’t at any rate,” answered Langdon, simply.

Barnes studied him a moment. Then he said more quietly, “And you’re
sure you can go as far as that? You’re sure you can go as high as she
can take you, Langdon?”

“A man can’t tell, Joe,” answered Langdon, sincerely, “but at
times--like this morning--I feel as though there were no heights I
couldn’t reach. She seems to put the whole world into song. I find
myself trying to set to music everything she looks at. It’s wonderful.
It’s--it’s almost terrifying. Why, when you were telling her about
Alaska--I watched her eyes and almost caught a symphony there.”

Barnes moved uneasily.

“What is it?” demanded Langdon. “It seems as though you ought to
understand.”

“Why should I understand?”

“Your eyes,” answered Langdon.

He leaned closer and for a second stared into them. Then he rose and
stood in front of Barnes.

“Why there’s a symphony in them,” he exclaimed. “A great, big tragic
theme--of some sort!”

Barnes smiled grimly.

“If I were an artist,” he said, “I’d paint you as you stand there
saying that, Langdon. There’s a big triumphant picture in you--of some
sort!”

Barnes made his feet and for a moment the men stood side by side
looking down upon the green valley which was slowly coming to life
there below them. What a song it was; what a picture it was! The
blazing sun was big enough to make both of it. For a second Barnes
caught a flash of some hidden meaning in this thought. Then his face
hardened; even the sun could not do both through one man alone.

Barnes turned abruptly.

“I’ll see you after breakfast, I suppose?”

“Yes,” answered Langdon, “I’ll come over early.”

Barnes hesitated. This hill-top now seemed like a strategic point. To
go meant leaving Langdon in possession. But this was only a concrete
example of the whole problem which he had worked out earlier in the
night. If he had entered this household upon the same plane upon which
Langdon had entered it, then he would have a right to remain on the
hill-top and fight for his pictures and all those meant. But he hadn’t.
That was the point. When he left Aunt Philomela that first night and
went upstairs, he had given a silent pledge of honor. To some men this
might seem a nice point, open at least to argument. But Barnes all his
life had lived by nice points. That was his glory as an artist. Without
another word, he trudged back down the hill.

The house was still asleep. It looked like a very young girl asleep. It
took the morning light drowsily and peacefully. Beneath the windows,
the flowers fresh from their dew bath met the eye of the sky proudly
and unashamed. It was impossible for Barnes, in the face of these
things, to brood. He couldn’t as yet endure the confines of his room,
but he strode off down the damp road with good spirit. Then he turned
off to the right and crossed the fields to the brook. Here in a clump
of alders he undressed and threw himself into the stinging cold waters.
As he bobbed up pink with every vein responding, he shook the water
from his eyes and struck across to the other bank. So for ten minutes
he swam in and out over the clean sands and water-cress like the king
trout himself. And when he came out it was with his brain clear and his
heart beating sturdily.

Barnes found Mr. Van Patten awake and waiting for him when he came back
to the house. The old gentleman measured time by the twittering of the
birds in the morning, and their sleepy chirp at night. His voice was
stronger and the grip of his hand on Barnes’ arm firmer. But more than
this Barnes noticed that which at first frightened him--an awakening in
the aged face, a new expression about the eyes in place of the blank,
fixed stare.

“Are the curtains raised?” demanded Mr. Van Patten.

“Yes,” answered Barnes, “as high as usual.”

“Put them way up,” insisted Mr. Van Patten. “I want all the light there
is.”

Barnes snapped them to the top. The room became flooded with the
morning sunshine. When he turned, the old gentleman was upon his elbow
straining towards them.

“What is it?” Barnes asked in some alarm.

Mr. Van Patten fell back again with almost a smile about his lips.

“Nothing,” he answered. “Sit over here by my side.”

Barnes took his usual position between the windows and the bed. Mr. Van
Patten turned to face him.

“Joe,” he began, “I lost five years of you out of my life and I’ve been
wondering just how far I’m to blame for it.”

“But that’s all over with now,” suggested Barnes.

“As far as I’m concerned. But there’s you--I don’t want you to suffer
what I suffered. I want you to learn.”

“As a son, I’ve learned,” answered Barnes.

“But not as a father, Joe. I suppose some day you’ll marry.”

“Marry?”

“And have a son of your own.”

“It--it doesn’t sound probable just at present,” answered Barnes.

“Well, you will, my boy. And the best I can pray for you is that you’ll
find another woman like your mother.”

There was just one woman like that mother to whom the old gentleman
referred. Barnes caught his breath at thought of it.

“I suppose there is another,” murmured Mr. Van Patten. “For someone,
Eleanor is going to be just such another.”

“Yes,” said Barnes. “I think she’s that one other.”

Mr. Van Patten moved uneasily.

“It’s easier to think of your marrying than of Eleanor marrying,” he
said. “But I suppose she will. Have you seen much of Carl?”

Barnes jumped at the question.

“Why, yes,” he answered, “I’ve--I’ve seen a good deal of him lately.”

“I’m glad of that, Joe. Eleanor has been thrown in with him nearly
every day this summer. What sort of a man does he appear--to a man?”

“But you’ve talked with him yourself, haven’t you?”

“Not much. I haven’t felt like seeing anyone. Aunt Philomela likes him.
Do you?”

It was a direct question. Barnes answered it directly.

“Yes.”

“He is clean and sincere?”

“Yes.”

“Eleanor says he has a very great gift in music.”

“I’m no judge of that, but I believe he’s honest as an artist.”

“Well. Well. The girl must choose for herself. I’ve thought the
intimacy was growing.”

“I think it is.”

“He would make her happy?”

“If she loves him, I have no doubt of it.”

“But she must be sure of her love. I trust you, Joe, to make that point
clear to her.”

“I think you may trust _her_ for that.”

“She will act up to her conviction but she is young--younger than her
years. And I--without my eyes--I can’t be much of a father.” He reached
for Barnes’ hand.

“You must be son and father and brother all in one, Joe.”

“I’ll do my best,” answered Barnes.

“I know you will, boy. I know you will. You’ve grown wonderfully in
these last five years. But I think you would have grown just the same
if you had not gone away. The fault was mine. I didn’t stay young
enough for you.”

“You seem very young to me now.”

“Ah, yes. I’ve grown young. That is the secret I’ve worked out in the
dark; as the son grows old, the father must grow young.”

The Princess stalked into the room and jumped upon the bed. The father
reached out to stroke her back and faced the door for Eleanor. She
entered with the blush of the morning in her cheeks. She nodded with a
smile at Barnes and then with a little laugh pressed her lips against
her father’s forehead.

“Dad,” she exclaimed, “you look so much better. You look so much better
every morning.”

“I’ll soon be out of bed now,” he answered with conviction.

Then he did the same thing which had startled Barnes upon his
entrance--he rose to his elbow and strained his eyes towards the girl
as though he had suddenly become endowed with his sight again. Miss
Van Patten glanced up swiftly at Barnes, as though for an explanation.
The latter could only stare back.

“What’s the trouble, Daddy?” she stammered.

His face was not troubled but he did not look as he looked yesterday.

“Nothing, child, nothing. Dr. Merriweather is coming to-day?”

“Shall I send for him?”

“No, but if Carl comes over--Carl is coming to-day?”

“I don’t know,” she answered.

“He told me that he was coming this morning,” put in Barnes.

“Then when he comes, tell him to ask the doctor to drop over this
evening.”

“Very well, Daddy.”

Mr. Van Patten smiled.

“Joe says he finds Carl a fine fellow.”

The girl glanced up swiftly at Barnes. He met her eyes fairly. Then he
nodded.

“Yes,” he answered, “I think he is.”

“But Daddy,” she exclaimed, and her cheeks grew a deeper crimson as she
spoke, “you have seen him. You know.”

“The young are better judges of the young, than the old are,” he
answered.

And reaching for her hand, he patted it tenderly.

“Carl has often said he wished to see more of you, Daddy. Perhaps now
that you’re stronger--”

“Joe must see for me,” answered Mr. Van Patten. “I leave Carl to him
for the present.”

Barnes arose.

“Father,” he said, “I will come up again--after Carl arrives.”

Whereupon he retired. To all intents and purposes it was a retreat.




CHAPTER XVI

JOHN GIVES HIS NOTICE


Aunt Philomela was waiting breakfast in no very good humor. On
the previous evening, she had sat up for an hour listening to the
unintelligible hum of her niece’s voice without being able to catch a
word of what she said. And when Miss Van Patten had finally stolen into
the room, Aunt Philomela had found little relief in her questioning.
The remainder of the night she had made a martyr of herself. She
dreamed that Eleanor had run away with a ne’er do well artist,
deserting her poor old aunt and her sick father. Then, in her dream,
Mr. Van Patten had died, thereby leaving her a lonely, heart-broken
old woman finding what solace she might in consecrating her life to
the poor of the village. And that, after all, was a poor sort of
consolation.

So when Aunt Philomela came down she was in no mood to be trifled with.
Yet it was just this inopportune moment that John chose to explode a
bomb-shell at her feet.

“I beg your pardon, ma’am,” he stammered, “but I wishes to give my
notice.”

“You--what?” she cried.

“I wishes to give my notice,” he repeated with more self-assertiveness
than she had ever suspected was in the man.

Aunt Philomela plumped herself down in a chair and folded her hands in
her lap.

“Well,” she gasped, “I never heard of such a thing in all my life.”

John automatically adjusted his tie and ran his hand over his chin. He
had been particularly careful in his toilet this morning.

“And what pray may be your reason?” she demanded.

“It’s nothin’ as you might say,” he answered uneasily, “that you can
put your hands on, ma’am.”

“Don’t you get enough to eat?”

“Lord, yes, ma’am.”

“Aren’t you well enough paid?”

“I wouldn’t take no more, ma’am.”

“Have you secured another position?”

“No, ma’am,” he hastened to assure her as though freeing himself from
the charge of treason.

“You have a nice, clean place to sleep?”

“A man could ask for nothing better, ma’am.”

If anything it was too clean and nice.

“Then what in the world is the matter with you?” she exclaimed, the
mystery deepening.

John cleared his throat. This was a difficult matter to express.
There have been plenty of better men in a like position--men with
well-defined notions of what they wished to say but when the time came
with no words to say them.

“Perhaps,” he suggested, “if I says I hasn’t slept for three nights
that will be enough.”

“Then all you need is a tonic,” she affirmed, brightening. “I’ll get
the bottle--”

She had half risen when he checked her. He remembered with decided
unpleasantness the taste of that dark liquid which she kept for the
occasional indispositions of her staff.

“No’m. It isn’t anything that medicine can fairly reach, ma’am. Thank
you, ma’am.”

“Then if it isn’t your blood, it’s your nerves,” she declared.

“Nerves comes nearer it,” he admitted.

“Perhaps you need a vacation,” she hazarded, though the prospect of
being left without John was unthinkable.

“I had thought of going off somewhere,” he confessed.

There was something in the way he said it--something in the way he
glanced swiftly upward towards Mr. Barnes’ room that gave her a clew.
She sat bolt upright.

“You don’t mean to tell me you’ve got your fool head turned about
Alaska, do you?”

John nodded weakly.

“It _was_ the Artcic that set me goin’.”

She sprang to her feet.

“Why, you--you’d freeze to death there,” she exclaimed.

“Lord, ma’am, I wasn’t thinking of going there,” he hastened to assure
her.

“Then what--” she stammered, all at sea again.

“I wants to get away from the Artcic,” he explained. “I wants to get as
far away as I can.”

“Well, you can’t get any farther away than this without running into
the ocean.”

John tiptoed nearer. He spoke in a hoarse whisper.

“He brought it with him,” he explained.

He turned his eyes towards the stairs again.

“What did he bring?”

“It,” answered John. “The Thing under the bed.”

“He did? Why, he was never within a thousand miles of--”

She checked herself just in time. John’s eyes had begun to open wide.
She was in a position more embarrassing than any which had yet grown
out of this course of deceit. If there were any one thing more vital
than cleanliness which she had impressed upon her servants, it was
truthfulness. She had held it before their eyes as a clear translucent
crystal. And now was she to be forced to violate it herself? Was she
to be thrust into the position of being untruthful to her own butler?
Her weak limbs shook beneath her at her helplessness. Her cheeks turned
scarlet.

“You don’t know, ma’am,” commented John.

She didn’t know! She would have given a year of her life if she didn’t
know. If only she herself were so deluded that she might innocently
repeat those outrageous yarns, she could at least preserve her self
respect. But no, she must sit dumb, expressing a silent lie.

“There’s Things,” whispered John, “that you doesn’t even suspect.”

At this she roused herself. She scented a new danger. Perhaps John was
eavesdropping last night.

“What do you mean?” she demanded, with some show of her old spirit.

“In the closet. Under the bed,” he answered.

“Are you crazy?”

The surprise occasioned by this unexpected statement bewildered her
still more. Surprise had followed surprise, until now she could make
neither head nor tail out of John’s fears.

“He says as how it has to do with gold,” continued John.

“So it was he who told you about this?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Have you ever seen it?”

“No, ma’am. That’s the trouble. I don’t mind anything I can lay my
hands on.”

He drew himself to his full height.

“Then,” choked Aunt Philomela, in helpless wrath, “why don’t you face
it like a man?”

“If it didn’t come from the Artcic, ma’am.”

“Well, it didn’t,” she declared.

“Then you knows about it?”

“Yes,” she answered coldly, “I know all about it.”

“Perhaps you’ve seen it?”

“I don’t need to see it, to know all about it.”

John looked skeptical.

“People always thinks things isn’t so until he sees them himself,” he
observed sadly.

“That is a frightfully ungrammatical sentence,” she commented.

“It doesn’t take grammar to see them,” he ventured with some truth.

“Bah!” she snorted.

Then of a sudden she came to herself.

“I can tell you what you’re going to do,” she stormed, stepping towards
him. “You’re going back to your work and think no more about these fool
things. You leave them to me. I’ll attend to them. You understand?
Go back to your work and do no more talking about leaving or I’ll
discharge you quicker than you can say Jack Robinson. You needn’t worry
about any more Things or Its. I’ll attend to those, too.”

John had been slowly pressed back. His spirit had quite gone at the
first sentence. He was not a timid man, but it took more than human
courage to stand before Aunt Philomela in such a mood. He would thank
his stars if he could only get safely into the buttery again. She
paused a moment, and John threw himself against the swinging door and
disappeared. Aunt Philomela turned around.

It was this auspicious moment that Barnes chose for entering. Aunt
Philomela swung upon him before he had time even to say good-morning.

“Do you think it’s honorable to scare a poor old butler half to death?”
she demanded.

He glanced around as though he expected to see the corpse of the poor
butler lying upon the floor.

“Why, no,” he agreed.

“Then why did you do it?”

“I?” he stammered. “Why, it’s the poor old butler who has been trying
to frighten me.”

“I’d be thankful if he had succeeded,” she snapped.

“He is a mystic--that man,” declared Barnes. “He is a seer of things in
the dark.”

“And who put the foolish notions into his head?” she insisted
unflinchingly.

“Who? I should like to know as well as you. Who taught him to walk on
tiptoe? Who taught him to appear as though through a trap-door? Who
taught him to look suddenly about as though in league with the unknown?
Who--” he demanded darkly, “taught him to look under beds?”

Aunt Philomela caught her breath at this last query.

“At least,” she returned weakly, “I never made him believe he saw
anything under there.”

“Nor I,” he hastened to explain. “That is what bothered us both; we
couldn’t find anything.”

“Perhaps,” she observed sarcastically. “Perhaps you wish to enter a
complaint against John.”

At this moment John himself entered with the coffee.

“John,” announced Barnes, “I beg to report that the Thing is gone.
Pouf!” he snapped his fingers. “All gone.”

“You really thinks so?” stammered John.

“I’ll give you a dollar for every time you find him after this,” agreed
Barnes.

“Lord, sir, I wouldn’t find him for a hundred.”

“Then we’ll let him go. As a matter of fact it got too hot for him
around here. He’s used to a colder climate.”

“That’s good, sir. I hope you sleeps better at night for it.”

“Hoping you will the same, I beg to remain,” he concluded, quoting from
the personal circular letter of the Acme.

John went out with a brisker step than he had shown for a number of
days, and in at the other door, with an even brisker step, came Eleanor.

It would be difficult to imagine a fairer harbinger of peace than
she, and yet it required all her best efforts to dissipate the cloud
which hung over the breakfast table that morning. Barnes, who was
always ready to assist at such an undertaking, was strangely silent,
while Aunt Philomela refused to enthuse even over the marked change
for the better in her brother’s condition. Everyone was glad when the
meal was finished. When they rose, Carl had not yet appeared. Barnes
braced himself to the task ahead. As Miss Van Patten stood uncertain
just what to do next, he suggested that she come with him into the
flower-garden for a breath of the morning air. She appeared a bit
startled but acquiesced, and so they made their way out doors.

Just how far it was his right to go, just how far it was his duty as
a brother to go, Barnes did not know, but that he must say something
in view of what was coming he had no doubt. She was bending over her
flowers plucking off dead leaves when he began.

“Eleanor,” he said, “your father seemed to be very much interested in
Carl this morning.”

“Indeed?”

“Very much interested,” he repeated.

She gave him no encouragement. He looked about anxiously.

“He and I both agreed that Carl is a fine fellow,” he observed. She
raised her head at this. She looked at him without embarrassment.

“Carl is an artist,” she said. “You and Carl ought to have much in
common.”

“Much in common?” he exclaimed. “We have. We have too much in common.”

“What do you mean by that?”

Her question was as direct and unsuspicious as a child’s.

“We agree on so very many things that--well, you know it’s sometimes
more comfortable to disagree.”

“Is it?”

“With Aunt Philomela, for instance. We get on much better by
disagreeing than we should if we looked at things in just the same way.”

“But at bottom, you know, you and Aunt Philomela really agree. She
wouldn’t quarrel with you if she didn’t agree with you.”

“No?” he asked with interest. “What would she do?”

“She would be very polite with you,” she answered.

“That would be terrible.”

“At least, it would be uninteresting. She is polite to the Reverend
John Powers.”

“I haven’t met him yet.”

“Not yet. But you can never tell when you may meet him.”

She bent over her flowers again. Barnes tried to collect his thoughts.
He hadn’t got very far with that beginning.

“The thing that impressed both your father and me about Carl--” he
began.

She lifted her head once more.

“Yes?” she inquired sweetly.

If he could only paint her as she stood now--as though she were growing
in the garden! So few women really get up until after lunch, but
she--she, like the poppies, awoke with the kiss of the sun into her
full beauty. There was no trace of the night about her. All her dreams
were tucked away in the long gallery with her pictures. Yesterday was
one with ten thousand yesterdays and she was as though new born for
this day alone. This was especially true of her eyes. As the planets
bear no trace of the eternal cycles through which they have ranged, but
come each night new created, so her eyes were almost abstract in their
freshness.

“I suppose,” she said, to break the silence, “I suppose I ought to take
Aladdin out to-day. He’s been shut up in his stall for a week now.”

Yesterday he would have protested. Now he basely betrayed his trust.

“If you are going to ride, you ought to ride this morning, oughtn’t
you?”

“Yes,” she answered. “I think I ought to go at once.”

He felt a bit uncomfortable, but if Carl didn’t know enough to take
quick advantage of his opportunity that was his own fault. Surely his
duty as a brother did not go so far as to manage Carl’s wooing. She
started towards the stable.

“I will go just as I am,” she determined.

“And I will help you saddle the horse,” he said.

Aladdin heard her coming before her feet had touched the barn floor and
greeted her with a glad whinny. He cropped at her fingers as she untied
the halter rope. Sam, the man of all work, came up, but she would have
none of his help. She led out the strong-limbed animal and in a jiffy
adjusted his bridle. The most that Barnes found to do was to throw
the saddle over his back, and even then she insisted upon fastening
the girths herself. Barnes kept his eye down the road and became as
impatient as Aladdin himself for the start.

Sam held out his hand and her foot scarcely touched it as she vaulted
lightly into the saddle. And then how like a queen she looked! Her long
skirt made her seem even more like one of those for whom King Arthur’s
knights fought.

She spoke a word to Aladdin, waved her hand, and in all too brief a
space was out of sight.

Barnes went back to the house. Near the Dutch door he met Carl.

“Eleanor,” explained Barnes, “has just galloped off.”

He took an immense amount of satisfaction in conveying this slight bit
of news. But the next second his enthusiasm vanished.

“Is that so?” answered Langdon. “Why, then, I guess I’ll go down the
road and meet her as she comes back.”




CHAPTER XVII

THE ROAD COMPLICATES MATTERS


With the breeze singing past her ears, Eleanor continued down the very
road along which she had walked with Mr. Barnes when she had gone with
him to the station for his bag. She smiled. She was quite sure that
had she been with Carl she would not have forgotten her mission. But
of course that was quite easy of explanation; Carl was, comparatively
speaking, an old friend now. With old friends one didn’t forget one’s
errands.

As she galloped along she seemed to hear Barnes talking to her again.
She recalled all that he had told her of his life, of his college
days, of his journey abroad, of his family at home, and the motive
which had prompted him to undertake his vagabond trip through these
hills. She had taken it as a pretty compliment that he told her these
things--especially after his confession that he had not intended to do
so. She smiled again. She could smile safely here alone on Aladdin’s
back. And there is nothing so worth smiling at as the woman power
which makes a man do something against his will.

She passed the apple-trees, the pines, and was well into the
maple-grove before she slackened her pace. Aladdin was in fine fettle
and resented the pull of the bit which slowed him down into a walk. He
tossed his head and jerked up his forelegs as though doing a quadrille.
But now her thoughts had come back to this morning and to the curious
emphasis which both men were placing upon Carl. Somehow Carl did not
seem a man who should be emphasized. He came as a pleasant part of a
summer day, and though at times when they had been playing together
he had been able to sweep her on into a more rarefied atmosphere, he
always brought her back again when he put down his bow. The thing she
had liked about him was that he had always been so unobtrusive and yet
by this very method he had made for himself a place in her life. If
Carl should go she would miss him. She would be almost homesick for
him. He was ever gentle, ever thoughtful, ever ready in his quiet way
to fill an hour that without him would be tedious. Then at intervals
came, too, those rare moments when he suggested to her a new life--when
he led her to the hill-top. In a word, Carl had taken her as he found
her, had blended himself with her, until now he was as important to
her in a way as Aunt Philomela, the old brick house, or Aladdin and the
Princess.

She had never quarreled with Carl. She could not imagine such a thing.
It would be as senseless as quarreling with herself. He understood
her perfectly and she understood him perfectly and each had too much
respect for the other ever to force an issue. Before a clash came
either he would surrender a point or she would surrender a point, and
so they would go on together harmoniously. She could always affect a
compromise with Carl. With a little glow of satisfaction she realized
that she could trust herself to him with this sure knowledge. If love
meant peace, then she and Carl were lovers.

With a little gasp of surprise she realized this was just what her
father had hinted at; with a burning of the cheeks and a tightening of
her throat she realized that this was what Barnes had tried to tell
her. With her father she accepted his concern with nothing more than
maidenly confusion at having it for the first time put so starkly; but
with Barnes she felt a touch of resentment.

From the first moment she had met Barnes he had a way, in spite of all
his well meaning, of making her uncomfortable. He had forced her into
a position which, however she might defend it to Aunt Philomela, which,
however much it justified itself, certainly had not been conducive
to peace in her own mind. Had she met Carl for the first time by the
letter-box that day, he would never have suggested such a disturbing
adventure as this upon which Barnes had embarked her. Carl would have
realized her position perfectly, would have sympathized with her fully,
and would have helped her to do that which out of her own conscience
she would have known must be done. In the end he might have taken his
violin and brought her solace for the inevitable consequences.

Again, in all the days she had known Carl he had never urged her to run
counter to any wish of Aunt Philomela’s. He would never have persuaded
her to walk to the station with him after his bag, and certainly would
never have forgotten the bag after starting. He would never have made
her go fishing; he would never have put her into an embarrassing
position before the cook or in the library; he would never have made
her so uncomfortable as she was this minute sitting upon Aladdin.

She touched her horse’s neck and he broke again into a gallop. Within
sight of the station, she turned and rode back again for fully two
miles without stopping. When she did stop it was at sight of Carl
swinging down a level stretch of road a full mile distant. Then, upon
the spur of the moment, she turned once more and galloped back towards
the station. But once well hidden by a turn in the road, she drew up
the horse and continued at a walk.

This unusual act was not so much inspired by Carl as by Barnes. Her
cheeks grew scarlet but she faced the fact squarely. She wished to
think a bit more about this man who had strode so soldier-like into her
life--even though it made her uncomfortable.

Carl had spoken of some great tragedy which he had seen in Barnes’
eyes. She herself had not seen it until this morning, when for a second
as he had stood with her by her father’s bedside she seemed to feel it;
and again later, when at breakfast, he had flashed a look at her which
suggested a pain which with difficulty he held in control. Yet, when
she had repeated Carl’s words to him, he had denied the tragedy, and he
was a man to tell the truth. Perhaps he himself did not yet recognize
it. Perhaps it was as yet something which he refused to admit even to
himself. The thought roused in her a queer little motherly concern.
He was doing so much for her that it seemed as though there must be
something she could do in return.

She laughed at herself. He was not a man to need any such slight help
as she might be able to give him. A man who talked so sturdily of
adventuring--a man who faced the purple rim of the sky with no other
emotion than eagerness to be over it--did not need her, who only drew
back from it in awe.

She had looked at a hundred sunsets with Carl. He had helped her to
see the beauties in them, had made her feel the song in them, had
brought home to her a sense of peace in them. But he had never left her
wondering; he had never sent her back through the little Dutch door
half in fear.

She caught herself with a start. She had drifted unconsciously into a
comparison of these two men. To say the least, this was presumptuous of
her. She turned Aladdin once more and gave him the bit. He sprang as
though at a hurdle and cut his feet into the hard road. She sat upon
his back with her thoughts so far away that she was scarcely conscious
of riding. So she took the first turn in the road more carelessly than
usual. She had just time to swerve one side from an automobile which
rounded the corner. She lost her balance, regained it, and, still
unsteady in her seat, knew that for the first time in his life Aladdin
had lost his head.

She was not frightened, but the unexpectedness of the emergency took
all the strength from her. When she pulled at the bit she found her
arms as weak as a child’s. She tried to speak, but found her tongue
dumb. As she swayed in the saddle she saw Carl. He was watching her
approach unable to make out whether it was a wild ride or a runaway.
Then she fell sideways, and her foot caught in the stirrup. She had
a vague memory of Carl’s white face as he stood in the middle of the
road; remembered seeing him spring, and then the dark closed in upon
her.

When again she came to herself, she was lying by the roadside and Carl
was bending over her. Her face was wet and he was moistening her lips
with a damp handkerchief. She couldn’t understand why he should be
doing this. He was covered with dust, his coat was torn, and his hand
was trembling.

“Carl,” she said, “what--what--in the world--have you been doing?”

“Eleanor,” he trembled.

She tried to raise herself to her elbow but the effort hurt her. As she
fell back again she remembered distinctly the vision of Carl standing
in the middle of the road and springing for the bit. Then she recalled
the whole incident. She looked anxiously at the dusty figure still
bending over her.

“You are hurt?” she asked quietly.

“My arm,” he answered.

She noticed that his left arm hung limply by his side. She tried again
to sit up but her bruised back forced her down again. She closed
her eyes. Through the dizzy turmoil in her brain one fact thrust
itself forward with acute clearness; Carl had saved her life. But for
him, Aladdin might have dragged her half a mile. The truth came as
something of a surprise. When she had seen him standing there, it had
not occurred to her that he would do this. She had only feared lest
he should be trampled down. Instead, he had stood his ground. She was
proud of him. It would be a pleasure to tell Barnes of this.

“If you’re more comfortable,” he said, “I’ll go back to the house and--”

“Where is Aladdin?”

“After I got you clear, he ran on.”

“He’ll return to the house,” she said, “I guess that’s all the word
they’ll need.”

Carl rose to his feet.

“I’d better make sure.”

He was unsteady. She was quick to perceive it.

“Sit down here by me, Carl,” she said, “they--they will come for us.”
He obeyed her. She noticed that his left arm hung like an empty sleeve.

“You were very brave, Carl,” she said.

The color returned to his cheeks. He looked down at her with an
expression that was quite boyish in its frank delight.

“Any man would be brave for you,” he said simply.

She wondered at this. It gave her a new sense of power and yet she did
not smile as she had when she learned that Barnes had told her things
he had not intended to tell her. Nor did the power seem so great,
though both incidents opened her eyes to a new personality within
her. And both gave her sense of responsibility which, while nursing
the pride which all responsibility gives, brought its burden too. In
mounting the throne which was her birthright, she was forced to assume
the duties of a ruler. A queen must take a sterner oath of allegiance
than the humblest of her subjects.

From the direction of the house, she heard the clattering hoof beats of
a racing horse.

“He is coming,” she said.

“Dr. Merriweather?”

“No,” she answered, “I don’t think it’s Dr. Merriweather.”

Carl stepped into the road. In a cloud of dust a horse and buggy was
approaching at a mad gallop.

“It’s Joe!” he exclaimed.

Eleanor smoothed back the hair from her brow and forced herself to sit
up. If a moment before her face had lacked color it did not now. With
Carl she watched the nearing carriage with an interest that almost made
her forget her pain.

Barnes drew up the horse with a suddenness that brought it to its hind
legs. Before it had fairly stopped he had leaped out, run across the
road, and knelt by her side.

“Thank God!” he exclaimed, as he met her smile. “You’re not badly hurt?”

“No, but Carl--”

He turned as though for the first time conscious that the other was
here.

“He has hurt his arm,” she said. “I guess he saved my life.”

“But _you_ are all whole? You aren’t cut or broken--”

“Only just bruised,” she answered, “but Carl--I’m afraid he’s broken
his arm.”

Carl had come nearer. Barnes rose and grasped his sound hand.

“You’ve earned the thanks of us all, old man,” he said.

Carl flushed.

“It was nothing. We--we’ve got to get her back to the house.”

“I’ve sent for the doctor,” said Barnes. “When I saw Aladdin come back
riderless I knew there was trouble.”

He returned to the girl.

“Think you can make your feet?”

“I--I’ll try.”

He placed his arm about her waist and she stood up. But she could not
rest her weight upon her left ankle.

“Put your arm around my neck,” he commanded.

She obeyed.

He placed one arm below her and lifting her clear of the ground bore
her to the carriage. Then with her right foot upon the step she easily
clambered in.

“Now you, Carl.”

The latter took his place by Eleanor’s side. Barnes swung the horse
about, touched him with the whip and they galloped back. He sat
between the two and did not speak again until they reached the house.
Then once more he took her in his arms and carried her into the house.
He carried her upstairs, though she protested at this, and lowered her
upon her little white bed.

Aunt Philomela neither shrieked nor fainted. In a business-like way she
ordered Barnes from the room and proceeded to disrobe the girl.

By the time Barnes was downstairs again Dr. Merriweather had arrived.
He admitted later that it was the only time in his life that his horse
had not gone fast enough for him. He went up the stairs two at a time.

Barnes found Carl, grown a bit faint, in the living-room. He got cold
water for him and then very gently removed his coat and slit his sleeve
to the shoulder.

“We’ll be ready for the doctor when he comes down,” he said. “Sure
you’re sound everywhere else?”

“Yes. But Eleanor--I’m afraid she’s hurt worse than she seemed.”

“She’s in the best of hands now. And Carl--it was bully of you.”

“Why--there wasn’t anything else to do!”

“No. But we don’t all do the only thing.”

“I guess anyone would--with her.”

“With her?” exclaimed Barnes. “Well, I don’t know but what you’re
right. Perhaps we all would--with her.”

He led him to a sofa and made him lie down.

From above came the imperious tinkle of the silver bell.

“There he goes!” exclaimed Barnes. “I wondered how long it would take
him to smell out this.”

He hurried upstairs where he found the old gentleman upon his elbow,
his eyes turned towards Eleanor’s room.




CHAPTER XVIII

WHAT MAKES A PRODIGAL


Dr. Merriweather reported that Miss Van Patten had escaped with nothing
worse than bruises and a wrenched ankle.

“But by the Lord, Harry!” he exploded, “it was nothing short of a
miracle.”

“A miracle?” questioned Barnes. “What about Carl’s part in it?”

The doctor paused a moment. Then he smiled.

“Carl was the miracle,” he answered.

Langdon himself did not get off so easily; his arm was broken below
the elbow and the danger did not so much lie in the break as in the
stiffness which might result. The doctor did not realize as fully as
Barnes what the sheer nimbleness of those fingers of the left hand
meant to Carl. Like a good many country physicians, he was greater as
a medical man than as a surgeon. He rather took this aftermath of a
fracture for granted. Consequently he was a bit surprised at Barnes’
concern in the matter.

“We’ll have his arm out of a sling in six weeks,” declared the doctor.
“May be a bit stiff, but--”

“Good heavens!” exploded Barnes. “You’d better amputate it and be done
with it.”

“What the devil do you mean?”

“I mean that if you take his fiddle away from him, you take away his
soul.”

“His soul?”

“Exactly. He couldn’t sing without his fiddle any more than I could
paint without my hands. What’s a soul without a song? And he--he has
some big ones to sing during these next few years.”

“Steady. Steady. Don’t let that imagination of yours run away with you.”

Barnes studied the big-framed, big-faced man a second and continued
more soberly.

“What you call imagination are the grim facts of life for him and for
me, doctor. His fiddle isn’t a detail of his life--it’s life itself for
him. Cripple his arm and you cripple his soul. You’ve got to fight as
hard for those fingers as you would for his life.”

If Dr. Merriweather was at first only annoyed by what he took to be
mere extravagance of speech, there was something now in the tense face
of Barnes which made him pause and think.

“Carl didn’t say anything to me about that,” he observed.

“No,” answered Barnes, “because he didn’t wish it to get upstairs.”

“To Eleanor?”

“To Eleanor,” answered Barnes.

Dr. Merriweather held out his hand.

“Boy,” he said quietly, “now I understand the miracle. You’re a better
physician in this household than I.”

“No. But when you live here day after day there are certain things
you’re forced to see.”

“I wonder if you’ve diagnosed anything peculiar about Mr. Van Patten
lately.”

Barnes moved uneasily.

“He seems better, that’s all.”

“Anything queer about his eyes?”

“I’ve noticed that every time anyone comes into the room he strains
towards him as though trying to see.”

“Just so. Has it occurred to you that perhaps he _does_ see?”

“That he can--actually _can_ see?”

The doctor nodded.

“Why no!” exclaimed Barnes. “Why--that doesn’t seem possible!”

“If he continues to pull himself together at this rate, it’s coming.
All I’m wondering about is if he isn’t even now playing possum.”

“Why should he do that?”

“I’m not saying that he is, mind you. But it wouldn’t surprise me if
some day he surprised the rest of you.”

“But look here--this is serious. If once he sees me--”

“Even then he might not recognize you. He isn’t as alert mentally as
he used to be; his new joy in life would force back every doubt; your
acceptance here by Aunt Philomela and Eleanor--”

“But Good Heavens that would mean a terrible crash in prospect. I can’t
stay on here forever.”

“It’s too much for me, my boy,” the doctor answered soberly.

“But if he can see now, why doesn’t he say so?”

“These old men get strange whims. Perhaps he’s waiting to make sure of
his sight so as not to disappoint the others by raising their hope. Or
it may be just an old man’s joke.”

Barnes smiled. It was something of an ironical smile.

“If one had the right point of view,” he remarked, “there are several
things a man might think a good joke here.”

“And you,” answered the doctor with a good-natured grin, “are that man,
I should say.”

“Perhaps.”

“Thank God it’s your type of man who’s playing this game,” concluded
the doctor.

It was three days before Barnes was allowed to see Miss Van Patten.
On the whole they were three of the most uncomfortable days he ever
passed. The father demanded more and more of his time and succeeded,
whether deliberately or not, in a pretty form of torture. He pressed
him harder in his questioning both about Alaska and about Carl and
never withdrew from his face those closed eyes which still seemed at
times to flicker as though opened the tiniest crack. But that may have
been pure imagination. There are holy images which if one gazes long
enough upon them appear to move their eyes.

Between his visits to the father Barnes made at least one daily
pilgrimage to Dr. Merriweather’s for a short talk with Carl. Here again
he submitted to another kind of torture. Barnes understood Langdon as
no one else on earth understood him, and this invited from the latter
the frankest kind of confidence. He listened and he suffered.

Back in the house again, he must needs repeat to Aunt Philomela the
greater part of his talk with Langdon.

“The dear boy!” she once exclaimed, “Eleanor is under very great
obligations to him.”

“Very great,” answered Barnes. “He saved her life.”

“I hope he’ll soon be able to come over.”

“So do I,” Barnes answered honestly.

“He and Eleanor have always got on so well together. In all the time
they have known one another they have never quarreled.”

“That is very well behaved of them.”

“So you see--” she concluded significantly.

“Yes,” he assured her hastily, “I see.”

During those three days, then, Barnes played his part like a good
actor--fulfilled his duty like a good soldier, but he lived in
dreary isolation. Aunt Philomela saw no change in him. If she had,
it would have been some satisfaction to her. As it was they dined
in solemn tête-à-tête and disagreed upon every topic proposed for
conversation--except Carl. If anything, Barnes’ meek acquiescence on
this subject irritated her more than an aggressive attitude on his part
would have done. It was altogether too noticeable not to excite her
suspicion. But for once she kept her counsel and waited.

It was on the fourth morning that, as she was rising from the breakfast
table, she announced,

“My niece wished me to tell you that she will see you for a few minutes
this morning if you care to come up.”

Barnes caught his breath.

“And you waited all this time before you told me!” he exclaimed.

Aunt Philomela raised her eyebrows.

“She is hardly ready at this moment to see you,” she observed haughtily.

“I know but--”

Barnes did not finish. What he was going to say was that by delaying
the news she had deprived him by just so much of anticipation. On
second thought he realized that this would probably not make her feel
so badly as it did him.

“Very well, Aunt Philomela,” he returned with dignity, “kindly convey
my compliments to your niece and tell her I shall be pleased to pay my
respects at any time she may suggest.”

“Which means I suppose that you’ll come up at about eleven.”

“At about eleven,” he agreed.

It took the tall clock in the library almost a day to compass the arc
between eight and eleven but it was finally accomplished. Before the
clock had ceased striking Barnes was on his way upstairs. He was met at
the door by Aunt Philomela who escorted him to her sitting-room where
Eleanor lay upon a couch looking not one whit worse for her adventure.
The color in her cheeks was even deeper if anything; her eyes full and
lustrous, if a bit startled; and her hand-clasp firm.

“It seems silly to lie here,” she smiled, “but between Aunt Philomela
and Dr. Merriweather, what can one do?”

“Nothing,” he agreed. “One might as well be in the hands of Fate.”

He took a chair at the head of the couch and Aunt Philomela picking
up a bit of lace upon which she was at work sat by the window and
proceeded still further to symbolize Fate.

“It’s been very dull in Alaska these last three days,” he observed.

“In Alaska?”

“Downstairs is Alaska,” he explained.

“But Aunty says that between father and Carl, you’ve been very busy.”

“I’ve had a great many things to think about,” he admitted. “One of
them concerns your father.”

“Daddy?”

Aunt Philomela glanced up from her knitting.

“Yes,” he nodded, “it may be necessary for me to make my excuses and
leave before very long.”

“What do you mean?” demanded Aunt Philomela.

“I mean that Mr. Van Patten is getting very much better. I mean that he
may see more than we think he sees.”

“His eyesight is returning?” exclaimed the girl, “Oh, that is too good
to be true.”

“His eyesight,” gasped Aunt Philomela flushing red, “you mean--you mean
he may yet detect us in this fraud?”

“For all I know he may already have done so,” answered Barnes.

The girl rose to her elbow. Aunt Philomela looked upon the point of
jumping from the window. “I’ve noticed,” stammered the latter, “that he
has made me very uncomfortable these last few days.”

“That may be only your conscience,” suggested Barnes. “But I--I have no
conscience and yet he has made _me_ very uncomfortable.”

“Dr. Merriweather knows this?” asked the girl.

“He has suspected it. He left it for me to tell you.”

“Why, it would be like getting Dad home from a foreign land,” cried the
girl.

“He would be almost like another prodigal,” smiled Barnes.

“Only,” she objected, “father has not wasted his substance in riotous
living.”

“That isn’t what makes the prodigal,” answered Barnes. “The prodigal
needn’t be really prodigal. It’s the journey away from home into the
far country that makes the prodigal.”

“You take great liberty with the Scriptures,” snapped Aunt Philomela
more to relieve her feelings than anything else.

“Like every artist,” answered Barnes unruffled, “I have learned the
Bible almost by heart. Do you remember what the father exclaimed when
he saw his son?”

Aunt Philomela pretended to resume her knitting.

“Perhaps you can quote it,” suggested Barnes.

“Perhaps _you_ will,” put in the girl to save her aunt’s feelings.

“He said,” resumed Barnes, slowly. “He said, ‘This my son was dead, and
is alive again; he was lost, and he is found.’ Nothing about riotous
living. The boy had gone away and came back again. That was all that
counted. That is all that will count when Mr. Van Patten comes back
from the darkness to you.”

So in his own life, he thought, his father was as much the prodigal as
he, the son, was. But he said nothing of this.

“If it should be true!” stammered the girl again.

She lost sight of all the complications this involved--lost sight of
all the other complications which had worried her before Barnes came
upstairs with this news.

“Aunty,” she determined, “I must go in at once and see him.”

But Barnes motioned her to lie down again.

“Not yet,” he advised, “let’s determine first what is best to be done.
Aunt Philomela--what do you say?”

Aunt Philomela frowned.

“I say it’s all a pretty pickle,” she answered.

“What do _you_ say?” asked Eleanor.

“This,” answered Barnes. “First of all, I must leave before he
recognizes me. Secondly, we must get his real son back to him as soon
as possible.”

“Yes,” agreed the girl. “But will Joe come?”

“I shall send him a wire every day until he does come,” said Barnes.

“And when he does come, what will Carl say?” demanded Aunt Philomela.

Barnes smiled.

“I don’t know,” he answered. “I fear he will be somewhat embarrassed.”

Miss Van Patten looked troubled. Here was another uncomfortable
situation to add to the long list of which Barnes was either the direct
or indirect cause. She looked at him with what he interpreted as an
appeal.

“Perhaps that isn’t a very important matter anyway,” he suggested.

“Important,” snapped Aunt Philomela, “I should call it very important.”

“How?” inquired Barnes.

“Because my niece and Mr. Langdon are engaged,” she exploded.




CHAPTER XIX

BARNES LEARNS A GREAT TRUTH


If Barnes had tried to paint Eleanor as she looked that moment, he
certainly would have had to dip his brush in damson preserves. She
turned upon her aunt with a little cry.

“Aunty, you know, for father’s sake, we decided it was best not to say
anything.”

“It’s high time,” she stormed back, “that some of us spoke out.”

Barnes leaned forward. He extended his hand to the girl.

“I congratulate--Carl,” he said.

She took his hand weakly and he rose. He stared about the room a second
as though uncertain just what to do or say next. Aunt Philomela, who
had assumed a very rigid pose, relaxed at the sight.

“I--I thought you suspected as much anyway,” she said.

“Why, yes--I did. Mr. Van Patten spoke of it--Carl spoke of it.”

The girl glanced up quickly.

“Carl said he had secured your consent,” she observed coolly.

“As a brother I advised him as best I could,” he answered. “But
when--when did he see you?”

“He came over this morning--against the doctor’s advice,” put in Aunt
Philomela.

“Well,” concluded Barnes, a bit inanely, “I must be going.”

Upon the words he started for the door.

“You still think that it--it is best for you to leave father?”

“I’m quite sure of that now,” he answered.

Barnes was not one to put off acting upon a resolution. He went down
the hall at once, and finding Mr. Van Patten awake put the matter to
him as gently as possible.

“Father,” he said, “I must go away for a little while--perhaps for a
week or two.”

“Away?” gasped the old man. “Again?”

There was genuine emotion in the old man’s cry. It was a father’s
cry and it created in Barnes an overwhelming desire for his own. In
something of a vision he seemed to see the old proprietor of the Acme
echoing this need for _his_ son. The little comedy had turned serious.
From acting the prodigal he found himself feeling the prodigal. He
wanted to get back home--not as represented by the Waldemere, but as
embodied in the flesh and blood of those whose name he bore. So it
happened that the more this aged gentleman upon the bed expressed the
need for a son, the more he stirred in Barnes the need of a father.
Barnes turned away his head from the searching blind eyes.

“Only for a little while.”

“A little while? My son, I’m living now by only little whiles.”

“You’re getting stronger every day,” said Barnes. “I want to see you
sitting up when I come back.”

The old gentleman shook his head.

“I don’t know. I don’t know,” he answered.

“Listen,” said Barnes, earnestly. “Life is beginning new, in more ways
than one, for all of us here. Your happiest days are coming. If you’ll
hold tight till I get back, I’ll prove it.”

“I’ll try,” he answered submissively.

“You must do more than that. You must fight. Will you promise?”

“Yes, boy, yes.”

“I’ll write to you every day. I’m only going as far as New York.”

“All right, Joe. Then--perhaps you had better start right off.”

“Two weeks; perhaps less. Good-by.”

The old man took his hand. Barnes bent over him and kissed his
forehead. Then he went out of the room and back to Eleanor. Here again
he saw no reason for delay. In reply to his knock she bade him come in.
She was sitting alone in the same position as when he had left her.

“I’ve told your father,” he said without preamble, “and now I’ve come
to say good-by to you.”

“You’ve told Daddy--already?”

“Yes. He bore it very well.”

“You’re so hasty,” she stammered. “You take away one’s breath.”

“Some things are best done hastily,” he answered.

“But this--why, Aunt Philomela is quite broken up at the idea of your
leaving. She--she has had to lie down.”

“Then I’ll not disturb her.”

“But--you must. She would never forgive you.”

She looked as though about to call, but he checked her.

“I must tell you first my plan. If it’s possible to get a wire
through to the boy, I shall do it. If, in the meanwhile, you yourself
hear anything from him, you must let me know at once. I’ll leave my
address.” He took a card from his pocket and handed it to her.

“You are so very kind,” she murmured, with a break in her voice.

“I shall write your father every day,” he went on, “so perhaps he will
not ask many questions.”

“I will read the letters to him myself,” she said.

He caught his breath. It was a commonplace enough remark but he grasped
at it like a compliment.

“Thank you,” he answered simply.

Certainly that in itself was a commonplace enough reply, and yet it
turned her cheeks scarlet.

When he spoke again it was very deliberately, as though the words
really had some profound meaning.

“If I’m able to get hold of Joe,” he said, “I myself shall come back
with him.”

“Oh!” she exclaimed, “that would be so helpful.”

“It is my one hope,” he answered.

Then, because there was so much more that he wanted to say; then,
because there was so much he mustn’t say, he turned his eyes towards
Aunt Philomela’s room. The girl obeyed his unexpressed desire in some
haste.

“Aunty,” she called.

She came in, a bit frightened. Certainly in appearance she bore out the
girl’s statement. All the fight seemed to have gone from her. She was
an Aunt Philomela he had never seen before. She was scarcely more than
a sweet, lovable old lady who looked very dependent. She came forward
uncertainly.

“You’re going?” she exclaimed, in as much astonishment as though this
were the first she had heard of it.

He nodded.

“I must start at once. I’m going to walk to Chester to catch the noon
train.”

“I--I’ll send John with you,” she stammered.

He smiled at the recollection this suggested.

“Thanks,” he answered, “but I still prefer to walk. I shall not
forget--this time.”

Miss Van Patten glanced at him with a queer little smile about her
mouth.

“Why--what are we going to do?” asked Aunt Philomela turning to her
niece.

“We must do the best we can,” answered Miss Van Patten.

“But I don’t know, I’m sure. It will leave us quite alone.”

“There is Carl,” suggested Barnes.

“Oh, yes,” answered Aunt Philomela, “I forgot. There is Carl.”

“If I find Joe I may come back for a few days,” explained Barnes.

“You’ll come back for a visit anyway, won’t you?” asked Aunt Philomela,
brightening.

“If I find Joe,” answered Barnes.

Here again the girl caught an almost formidable note.

The little old lady moved uneasily.

“I must thank you for all you’ve done,” she faltered, almost as though
this were an apology.

“Please don’t thank me,” he insisted.

At this opportune moment John entered with a cup of broth for Miss Van
Patten.

“John,” requested Barnes, as the man put down the cup and was upon the
point of leaving, “will you be good enough to pack my bag?”

John looked surprised.

“Yes, sir,” he answered.

He paused, coughed, and then blurted out,

“Could I have a moment with you, sir, before you leave?”

It was Barnes’ turn to look surprised.

“Why--yes,” he agreed.

Barnes turned again to Aunt Philomela.

“You have lost some of your color,” he said unexpectedly. “Would you
mind if I gave you some good advice?”

She looked bewildered but she shook her head.

“It’s just this,” he continued, “don’t worry over your accounts.”

“No,” she answered.

She spoke so mildly that the girl smiled.

“For,” he went on didactically, “there’s nothing so bad for the nerves
as modern business methods.”

The little old lady glanced up to see if he were smiling. He was not.
He never was when she suspected him of it.

“I’m afraid I’ll never get them straightened out again,” she sighed.

“So much the better for you,” he assured her. “What you really ought to
do, Aunt Philomela, is to take up gambling.”

“What?” she demanded sharply.

He nodded blandly.

“If I ever have the opportunity I’ll teach you draw poker.”

“The least anyone can do at my age is to refrain from acquiring bad
habits,” she answered.

“On the contrary, your age is the only safe age in which to indulge
in them,” he argued. “Nothing keeps one so young as the element of
uncertainty. That is why I recommend gambling. But you can gamble a
little, even with your accounts; you can let them run so that you will
never quite know where you stand. Some such excitement would brace you
up wonderfully.”

“Bah!” she observed, with something of her old-time scorn.

“You made a good beginning,” he suggested, “when you bought into ‘The
Lucky Find.’ Mining stocks are always a good gamble.”

“‘The Lucky Find’ wasn’t even a good gamble,” she declared.

John entered with the dress-suit case. Barnes extended his hand to the
little old lady. He was a believer in abrupt departures. He disliked
the inclined plane of inanities usually accompanying a farewell.

“Au revoir, Aunt Philomela,” he said simply.

The little old lady took his hand. Her fingers were trembling.

“You--you have been very kind,” she faltered.

“Good-by, Eleanor.”

“Good-by,” she said.

He turned, and John followed him to the Dutch door.

“I thought,” began John, “I’d just like to ask you once more about ‘The
Lucky Find.’ You are still interested in it, sir?”

“Extremely.”

“Would you advise me to hold the stock, sir?”

“I’d advise you to hold it for two weeks,” answered Barnes.

“Very well, sir. Thank you, sir.”

“I think there’ll be at least one more dividend,” he assured him.

“That’s very good, sir. Good luck to you, sir.”

“Thank _you_,” Barnes answered earnestly. “I need everyone to wish me
Good Luck.”

He hurried down the path and turned into the road. It had drunk of
the sun so long that it was more saffron than ever. And yet what a
groveling creature it was! It licked the feet of the houses by its
side. What, after all, were the houses? Mere shelters for men. What of
these men with their strong legs and the arrogant pose of their heads?
The eyes of the women bade them stay and they stayed; bade them go, and
they went. Neither the road nor the houses nor the strong-rayed sun
could countermand that order. Men went to wars, they went to sea, they
pushed through forests, they dared the icy mountains of the North--for
what? Gold? Bah! Where did the gold go, murmured the women who remained
behind smiling to themselves? For fame? Who gave them fame questioned
the deep eyes of the women? For selfish pleasure? Wherein lay the
pleasure until it shone in the eyes of these same women? The road,
then, was no worse than the men, and both were a convenience for the
women who lived in the houses.

That was all. Barnes saw it clearly enough now.




CHAPTER XX

SO DOES HIS MOTHER


Mrs. Horatio G. Barnes was sitting in lonely grandeur in the
drawing-room of her suite at the Waldemere listlessly watching the
scant life which crawled along the hot macadamized road below her. She
was a tall woman with a serious face which on the whole was really
beautiful. Her wistful gray eyes were set between rather high cheek
bones and above a nose and mouth wonderfully well formed if a trifle
masculine. The warm glow of her fine skin and her abundant white hair
relieved them of prominence. She was tastefully dressed in black and
wore no jewels save a single large stone guarded by her wedding ring.

The high semi-formal room in which she sat seemed no part of her. She
looked as though she had stepped in here as into the waiting-room of
one of the more pretentious hotels. In spite of the luxuriousness and
the fairly good taste which she had forced upon her surroundings, she
rose superior to them. They were too new to match the centuries which
still lingered in her eyes; they were too obvious to match the quiet
reserve of her own manner.

She lifted her eyes from the brass-trimmed touring car which slid
by on the street below and raised them to the stark blue sky above.
The strong family resemblance to her son was then obvious. Her eyes
were the same which Barnes had raised to the cotton-blossom clouds.
In them there was the same yearning for expression. But the mouth
was different; there was no trace here of that shrewd humor which
characterized Richard’s; nothing but the set capacity for infinite
endurance. It was the mouth of a warrior mother. But as the sky gave
her imaginings the freedom to roam a world common to her son, her lips
grew tender.

She wondered what the boy might be doing at that moment. Perhaps he was
sitting by the roadside sketching; perhaps admiring the work of other
sketchers in that gallery of which he had spoken in one letter. She
wondered if the money she sent him, had safely reached him. It might
be as well to send him more if she didn’t hear from him by to-morrow.
She might even make a flying trip down there to see what he was about.
But there was Horatio. She realized that her husband’s sole pleasure
at the end of those hot days lay in finding her waiting for him here.
He had not seemed as well as usual during this last week. Though he
never spoke of it, she suspected that he was missing the boy. At night
he tossed uneasily and once she had heard him murmur “Richard” in his
troubled dreams.

It was too bad that in spite of his disappointment at losing an heir
to his business throne, that he could not understand. Not all men
were created with the same ambitions. He himself had left the farm in
which his father had taken such pride. If then her boy wished to paint
pictures--

She started as she felt a pair of arms about her neck. Looking around
she found a brown face next to hers.

“Dick,” she cried breathless.

“Home again, mother,” he assured her.

“Home,” she exclaimed. “I haven’t heard you say home for years, Dick.”

“Where’s Dad?”

“At the office,” she answered sadly. “He has missed you, Dick.”

“I’ve come back--like a prodigal,” he answered, kissing her, “but I’m
not repentant. I’m going to have a talk with Dad to-night.”

She looked a bit frightened.

“But first,” he said, “a talk with you. Put on your mildest bonnet and
we’ll take a walk in the park.”

Without delay she obeyed and stepped with him into the elevator. It was
with some pride that she passed through the office by the side of her
tall son; it was with a renewed vision of life that she walked with
him along the hot street and over the familiar course they had footed
together so many times. She noticed with further pride that several
passers-by glanced twice at them. She did not realize that this might
have been prompted somewhat by her son’s costume which, in contrast to
her own modish dress and that of the other pedestrians, was strikingly
picturesque. He still wore his dusty walking-boots, his flannel shirt
and loose tie. With his brown skin and erect bearing he looked like a
soldier home on a furlough from active service.

In twenty minutes they reached the park which was associated more
intimately with his life than any other spot in New York. For it
was here that she used to bring him as a child, as a schoolboy, and
finally whenever he came home from college. It was here that the
first discussions took place on Art versus the Acme; it was here that
she threshed out her own conflict of duty to her son and duty to her
husband. Until now she had felt that she had failed miserably in
attempting to harmonize the hawthorn in her blood with the pine in her
husband’s. But to-day there was that in her son’s bearing which seemed
to give her fresh hope. So they came to their favorite seat and sat
down.

“Mother,” he began abruptly, “I’ve learned a great deal in this last
week.”

“You hinted about your big picture. You have it nearly done?”

“I haven’t begun it yet--on canvas,” he answered.

“It sounded very attractive as you described it,” she encouraged.

“It’s a wonderful subject,” he exclaimed. “But it’s much easier to
paint a landscape than--”

He paused. She finished for him,

“A woman?”

“Yes.”

“A young woman?”

“Yes.”

She was silent for a moment. Then, without looking at him, she rested
her hand upon his arm.

“Tell me about her, Dick.”

“I had thought of using a big canvas and--”

“Tell me about _her_, Dick.”

“You think--”

“That my boy will never be content with a mere picture of her,” she
interrupted.

“Mother, you’re a wizard,” he declared.

“Not I,” she answered almost a bit sadly. “It is she who is now the
wizard.”

“It is her eyes,” he exclaimed. “Her eyes, her nose, her mouth, her
chin, her hair--her soul.”

She gently patted his arm still without looking at him. Her own eyes
had grown wistful as though in fixing her gaze upon the sunshine which
sprinkled through the leaf-shadows she was bidding something good-by.

“Tell me from the first day, Dick,” she murmured.

So he began with the sobbing by the letter-box and took her hour by
hour through the events of the succeeding days, trying hard to make
her see as vividly as possible every detail of them. But when he had
concluded, she had clearly in her mind but one picture--that of a young
woman painted in a bewildering combination of black and gold and damson
preserves. And this woman met her eyes with something of a challenge.
She continued to pat her son’s arm silently and very gently.

“So there she stands,” he ran on, “and every path in this old park
seems to lead to her.”

He did not notice the quick flash in his mother’s eyes, followed by
a deepened look of patient resignation. He did not know that he was
hurting her. He did not know that he was making this park a foreign
place to her.

He lowered his voice.

“And back there too is Langdon. Mother, do you think I was a fool to
leave him?”

“I don’t see what else you could do.”

“Only that a man has a right to fight for his own--giving and taking no
quarter.”

“But she isn’t your own, Dick.”

“No,” he admitted, “that’s true. And yet she’s already so big a part of
me--”

“Don’t worry, boy.”

“There’s one other thing I wanted to see you about. I ought to settle
down now into some sort of definite work. I might get some sort of a
teaching position, I suppose.”

“No,” she answered quickly. “There’s no need of that.”

“Well, there’s always the Acme.”

“Nor the Acme either,” she said decidedly.

“But here I am twenty-five years old--”

“Dick,” she interrupted with some concern, “I don’t want to see you
change. She would not wish to see you change. You’ll paint good
pictures some day. Promise me you’ll not say anything to your father
about coming into his business. Promise that to me and--to her.”

“Why are you so serious about it?” he asked.

“It is a serious matter. Will you promise?”

“Yes.”

“The world is changing for you, Dick,” she hurried on, “and the thing
to do now is to hold fast to your true self. Don’t let the world change
_you_.”

He was soon off again on another panegyric. She listened with her face
grown tender but with that same far away look in her eyes. So they sat
until the evening shadows began to creep in and she bethought herself
of her husband.

“Be good to him, Dick,” she pleaded. “He has missed you. I think he’s
changed some in this last week. I heard him say once that he might go
back to the old farm for a visit.”

“Great,” exclaimed Barnes. “If we can keep that idea in his head, we’ll
make a man of him yet.”

“Dick!”

“Well, that’s what he ought to do--go back there and stay. He ought to
live a while now.”

As they were returning, she said, for the first time able to
disentangle from his narrative a strand other than that of the girl
herself,

“I’m glad, Dick, that you had an opportunity to ease the other father.
It was a deed worthy of you.”

“Ah, if you could see him!”

“And yet I think even if blind I should have known my own,” she mused.

“You mothers know more than anyone else in the world,” he replied,
taking her arm.

“I’m glad you did it, Dick,” she said again. “It may in some way have
had its effect upon your own father.”

“You’re getting mystical.”

“No,” she protested, “but I’ve never seen him so concerned with matters
outside the--Acme. He’s quite changed.”

“Shall I tell him about this?”

“No. Let me tell him,” she said gently.

She looked up at him proudly. After all, he was hers. If anyone chose
to care a great deal about him, why, that other was only caring for her
boy. Even if he cared a great deal about someone else, it was still her
boy who was caring.

They reached the Waldemere.

“Mr. Barnes has been inquiring for you,” announced the clerk.

“I have been to walk with my son,” she informed him.




CHAPTER XXI

AN OLD PRODIGAL COMES HOME


Mrs. Barnes retired that night with uneasy foreboding, leaving father
and son together. As she went out, she patted her son’s shoulder and
stooping pressed her lips against his light hair.

Horatio Barnes watched her until the curtains closed behind her, and
then faced his son determinedly. He was taller than the latter and
heavier. His smooth-shaven face was pale and clouded. A physician would
have noted many little danger signals. His expression was that of a man
who has summoned all his reserve strength to some grim crisis. Barnes
was surprised at the change which had taken place even in the short
time he had been away. Aggressiveness had degenerated into petulance;
self-confidence into bull-headedness. Yet below all this he saw an
outcropping of sentiment which surprised him.

“Well,” demanded the father, lighting a black cigar, “what do you
propose to do now?”

“Paint,” answered Barnes, “harder than ever.”

The father scowled.

“Haven’t you had enough of that yet?”

Before the mother, the two had avoided this subject.

“No,” Barnes answered, “I’m just awaking to the possibilities in Art.”

The father chewed his cigar a moment.

“Boy,” he said finally, “this business here is getting too big for me
alone. I can’t hold on much longer.”

“Then chuck it,” advised Barnes.

For another minute the father silently chewed his cigar. He kept
control of himself because to do so meant just one chance of keeping
control of this business.

“The Acme,” he resumed with an effort, “needs Youth. It needs someone
who can put in twenty hours a day and not come to the office the next
morning with a twitching face.”

“What it needs, then,” suggested Barnes, “is a man of cast-iron--with a
scroll on his forehead.”

“It’s a big business,” went on the father with unexpected calmness.
“It’s a business to be proud of. It’s a business that a young man would
take over with forty years already put into it.”

“Good Lord!” exclaimed Barnes, “isn’t that enough of good red years to
feed into cook-stoves?”

Barnes, Sr., rose to his feet. He paced the room once or twice. He
looked like a man fighting off bankruptcy. Barnes pitied him--pitied
him from the bottom of his heart. But that was no reason why he should
help him to his doom.

“God!” exclaimed the father, taking a stand directly in front of the
boy, “I wonder how you ever happened to be a son of mine!”

“I _am_ a son of yours,” answered Barnes, coolly, “but I am no son of
the Acme’s. Sit down, father. Don’t tear yourself to pieces. Let me
make a proposition of my own.”

He placed his hands upon his father’s shoulders.

“Dad,” he said soberly, “I want you to take up Art.”

Barnes, Sr., met his son’s eyes a moment in astonished stupefication.
Then he sank weakly into his chair. Which left Barnes standing with the
appearance of occupying the superior position.

“Dad,” he ran on, “I’m serious. This damned business of the Acme must
be stopped. You’ve sat in your office down there until you’re baked
as dry as though you had been sitting in one of your own ovens. It’s
burning the soul out of you. I’ve seen these last few days just how
small at best a cook-stove is.”

The older man made no reply, but his lips began to twitch. Barnes
seated himself before those twitching lips and resumed.

“I’ve been down where people live. Dad, I’ve been back on a farm--just
such another farm as gave you the strength to be alive to-day in spite
of the way you’ve misused your strength. I’ve been back where trees
count for something and where the blue sky is a big item of return
for the day’s work. I’ve been back where you still see the sun in the
daytime and the stars at night. I’ve been with an old man who expected
to have to leave those things--who would then have given every cent
he had to stay another day in the midst of it. If you had strewn
cook-stoves end to end across the continent, he would not have swapped
five breaths of night air for the whole of them.”

The old man scowled up at him as though wondering if he had lost his
reason.

“I ought to have taken you along on that walk with me,” ran on Barnes,
reminiscently. “It would have shown you what life can mean. You ought
to have stood on the hill with me and watched the cotton-blossom
clouds. It would have helped you understand that look in mother’s
eyes which puzzles you every time you boast of another hundred
thousand. You think you are rich and powerful. But listen to this;
you haven’t money enough in all your banks to buy one minute of that
single week of me. You think I’ve been idle, but let me give you an
inventory: five minutes on a hill-top--value five thousand dollars;
ten minutes by a letter-box--value ten thousand dollars; a half hour
with Aunt Philomela--value thirty thousand dollars; an hour by a trout
stream--value one hundred thousand dollars; an hour in the library,
value--”

“Bah, you’re a fool!” broke in Barnes, Sr.

“I’ll submit to any jury who’s the greater fool--you or I,” answered
Barnes, calmly.

“D’ye think you can live on such dream money as that?” demanded the
father.

“Better than you are living on what you have,” declared his son.

He paused a minute and then added soberly.

“My capital would buy for mother what you haven’t been able to buy
with yours. It wouldn’t leave her in June staring out of a window at a
macadamized road.”

“What’s that?” demanded the father, straightening up.

“It wouldn’t leave her to sit alone and wonder when you’re going to
drop with apoplexy,” he went on calmly.

He was almost brutal, and he knew it. It seemed the only way. To
drive a new fact into that steel-chilled brain one had to use a sledge
hammer. And Barnes realized that it was now or never.

“You--you think your mother is not happy?”

“Dad,” answered Barnes, “figure it out for yourself. Mother came from
a green land--a land where even the fences are made of hawthorn;
where even in the heart of London the sheep still nibble the grass;
where acres of green grass are within walking distance of the Bank of
England. The love of open spaces is in her blood. Yet you’ve taken her
and shut her up here in this damned cage, and here you leave her all
day long, only to come home at night with your face twitching. She
isn’t doing any grumbling. She is isn’t that kind. I’ve never heard a
word of complaint out of her. But I’ve eyes that aren’t covered up with
sheet iron. When I saw her to-day I felt like helping her escape as
though she were in prison.”

“Lord, boy!”

“What are you giving her?” demanded Barnes, pressing home his point.
“Only this,” he answered, waving his hand about the apartments. “And
yet she’s kept your books for you and stood by you for forty years. You
remember your own boyhood. I’ve heard you tell about those fair days
back on the farm. Why don’t you give her a bit of that to remember?
Why don’t you chuck a few flowers and a ray of sunshine into her life?
I’ve given her more than you have, myself; I’ve taken her out in the
park. Why don’t you take her back to the best days of your life? It’s
time you had a honeymoon. It’s time you lifted her face to the dew.
It’s time you let the sun beat down upon her a while.”

The father had dropped his cigar. He fixed his worried eyes upon his
son. He looked as though he were stunned. Barnes lowered his voice.

“I want you to see this, Dad,” he went on. “I want you to see it for
her sake and your sake. I don’t think we have grown very far apart--you
and I. If I’m not the son of your brain, I’m the son of your heart.
I’ve been sitting by the side of an old man and he made me see that.”

The father met his boy’s eyes.

“It hurt to have you go, Dick,” he said.

“It was an act of Providence,” declared the latter. “If I hadn’t, we
might have gone on this way until--it was too late to do anything.”

“To do anything?”

“Too late for you to take up Art.”

The father glanced up with the old evil spirit again in his eyes.

“Don’t go back to that,” he pleaded.

“Why not? That’s what you’ve got to do. And after all, you’re an artist
in your own way. Look at the scroll on the Acme doors! Look at your
stand against the Union! That was a stroke of art. Art is nothing but
independence. Art is nothing but being yourself--expressing yourself.
You’ve done that consistently whenever you’ve really been yourself.
You didn’t stop to consider how much you were going to lose in shekels
when you told the crowd you’d go busted by yourself rather than make a
fortune under them.”

Horatio Barnes smiled grimly.

“No one but a true artist could have done that,” insisted the son. “Any
other would have reckoned the cost and swallowed the pill.”

“But I beat ’em,” chuckled the father.

“Art beats every time,” declared Barnes. “It’s the one thing a man
may pin his faith to. But that wasn’t your biggest piece of work as
an artist. You transcended that. You really proved yourself when
you married mother. It was then that you were true to your highest
standard, because then you were truest to yourself. You could have
married a fortune had you chosen and saved yourself twenty years of
hard work. You could have married old Arbuckle’s daughter and placed
the Acme where it is to-day two decades ago. Are you sorry you didn’t?”

“Sorry!” exploded the father. “Your mother, sir, is worth more to me
than all the money in the Bank of England.”

“Of course she is. That’s bully of you, Dad. And you’ve lived up to
that. You’ve fought for Art in fighting for her against Lord Dunnington
and all his caddish tribe. Like any good artist, you’d sacrifice every
round dollar to make her stand well before them. That isn’t business,
it’s Art. It’s living up to your ideal against all the world.”

“But,” protested the father, “that isn’t painting pictures.”

“Lord forgive your blindness, Dad,” Barnes exclaimed. “Painting
pictures is only one little way of expressing yourself. A man may be
a great artist without ever having held a brush. A man may be a great
artist in song, in verse, in prose, in life, even in business. But in
business you mustn’t forget that back of it lies life. That’s where
you slipped up. You forgot that you’re here to live--to give life to
Mother, your masterpiece. To be sure, I’ve chosen to paint pictures.
That seemed to me the only way in which I could live up to my best. But
that doesn’t make me any better or worse than you. The whole game is to
get broad and big through whatever you do.”

“Then why shouldn’t I stick to business?”

“Because you aren’t getting big; because you’ve gone stale. You need a
change.”

Barnes, Sr., shifted in his chair. He reached for his cigar-box. That
was a good sign.

“I--I don’t know but what you’re right, Dick,” he admitted.

“I’m sure of it, Dad.”

“I’ve thought lately that it--it wouldn’t be bad to take your mother
back to the old place.”

“Do it! Do it!” exclaimed Barnes. “Make up your mind to-night. Decide
before you go to bed.”

“That means giving up opening a--London office.”

“You’ve too many offices already. Cut ’em down. Tell mother you’re
thinking of taking a rest, and you’ll see her grow ten years younger.”

“You think that she--”

But the question was answered by the mother herself who stole through
the door in her dressing-gown. Her cheeks were pale with worry. In
negligee she appeared so much older and tired that Barnes was startled.
He crossed to her side, placed an arm about her waist, and led her to
his chair.

“What is it, mother?” he asked.

“Nothing. Only--it’s very late. What have you two been talking about?”

“Ask Dad,” he replied.

She turned her worried eyes upon her husband. The latter too saw for
the first time the years in his wife’s face. He quailed.

“Horatio,” she cried, “what’s the matter? Are you ill?”

He roused himself.

“Wife,” he said, rising to his feet. “Wife.”

He placed an arm about her. He threw back his shoulders.

“Wife,” he announced with emphasis, “I’m going to take up Art!”




CHAPTER XXII

THE BLIND SEE


Barnes was awakened the next morning by a gentle tap at his door.
He thought it was John. But, in answer to his response, his mother
entered. She looked as fresh as a girl of twenty. Her face was radiant.
She crossed swiftly to his bedside.

“Oh, Dicky boy,” she cried joyously, “there’s been a miracle! The
prodigal father has come back home.”

“Miracle?” questioned Barnes, patting her hand. “What about my part in
it?”

“Why, you,” exclaimed the mother, “you’re the miracle.”

Barnes smiled. It was just so Dr. Merriweather had answered him when he
had put a similar question about Carl. He was learning something about
how miracles are performed. It seemed as though if you loved mightily
it was possible to accomplish most anything. And yet, in the supreme
undertaking of his life, where he had loved most, he had lost. All
night long he had wondered about this.

At this moment Horatio Barnes himself strided in, dressed in a
bath-robe and slippers that wouldn’t stay on.

“Morning, Dick,” he shouted, “I’m going to keep a herd of Jerseys. In
the old days Mitchell used to beat us all hollow on stock, but I’ll
have some this time that will make his eyes stick out. I hope there are
a few Mitchells left to watch me carry off the blue ribbons. Suppose
they still hold the County Fair?”

“Haven’t a doubt of it,” answered Barnes, enthusiastically, “but I’m
afraid we won’t be able to get in for it this Fall.”

“Won’t?” snorted the father. “How much time do you want? I’ll have a
herd within a week or know the reason why.”

“Steady, steady,” his son cautioned. “Remember there are tenants on the
old farm at present.”

“I’ll move ’em out bag and baggage within a month. I’ll do it if it
costs twenty thousand dollars.”

“Whew,” whistled Barnes, “but when you do make up your mind--”

“I don’t wait,” answered the senior. “There’s another thing I want
settled right off. I’m going to start a close corporation for the
promotion of Art. I’ll appoint myself president of the company and make
you vice-president, treasurer, secretary, and general manager on a
salary of five thousand a year.”

“You what?”

“Our offices will be on the farm. I’ll touch up the fences, while you
attend to the sunsets.”

“This is a joke?”

“Not by a good deal,” snorted Barnes, Sr. “If you’re in for that sort
of thing, I’m going for once to put it on a paying basis. If you’ll
paint your mother as she looks this minute, I’ll pay you ten thousand
cash for the job.”

Barnes turned towards her.

“I don’t believe I can do it,” he answered, “but I’ll try.”

“Then it’s a bargain?”

“A bargain,” answered Barnes, gripping his father’s hand.

That morning Barnes sent off a second telegram to Joe. It read,

“This is a case of life or death. Come home.”

[Illustration: “Do you remember,” he asked gently, “what I told you
about the true adventurers?”

                                                         _See page 328_]

Then he sat down to write a letter to the other father and through the
father to Her. She had said that she would read these letters herself.
Her hands would hold the paper; her eyes would scan the script; her
lips would utter the words. If the waiting father were able to do
nothing more, Barnes thanked him for this priceless privilege of
thus indirectly furnishing him the means for talking a bit each day
with Her.

The letters were necessarily vague and rambling. Barnes spoke
mysteriously of business, of men seen and others to be seen, of the
necessity of waiting here for word from one who he hoped in the end
would relieve him of all his mining ventures.

“I await a reply, which should reach me any day now,” he wrote. “When
it arrives, I’ll come back. Give my love to Aunt Philomela and to
Eleanor.”

It was two days later that he received an answer in Eleanor’s own
handwriting. At sight of the envelope he felt for a moment as though
all his wildest dreams had come true--as though he were to find within
all that he hungered to hear from her. But it turned out to be nothing
but a quiet gossipy letter about Aunt Philomela and of course chiefly
about her father. He was improving daily, and Dr. Merriweather was now
quite sure he was to recover his sight. He spent all his waking hours
in talking of his boy.

“Oh,” she concluded, “Joe _must_ come home now. Not even you could
save Daddy from the blow which would follow should the boy refuse. I
am waiting every minute for a telegram from him. With a heart full of
gratitude to you, I remain, sincerely yours, Eleanor Van Patten.”

That day Barnes sat in the park from lunch to sunset with his mother.
Both he and she agreed that the only significant feature of the letter
was that it contained no mention of Carl.

So a restless week passed, the most important incident of which,
outside his daily letter from Eleanor, was the fact that Barnes, Sr.,
received an offer for the Acme and in his usual impetuous fashion
closed with it in twenty-four hours. He came home that momentous day at
three instead of five, and save for the time when Barnes, Sr., received
her promise to be his wife, he never received a finer reward than that
which greeted his announcement to her of this decision.

“And so, you old prodigal,” choked Barnes, as he grasped his father’s
hand, “you’ve come home, too.”

“Prodigal?” stammered his father, though with tears in his eyes.

“Think of all the years you’ve wasted in riotous earning,” exclaimed
the son. “You can thank old Van Patten for your conversion. You two men
have got to meet. He wasted five years in riotous pride. But he’s come
home, too, now. We’re all home except Joe, and--well, I’m back in the
_old_ home any way.”

“What do you mean, sonny?”

“Nothing. I’m going to get Joe back now if I have to go to Alaska for
him, that’s all.”

It was no easy matter to keep Barnes, Sr., in New York during the
following week, but for that matter it was no easy matter for Barnes
himself to stay. But he couldn’t leave until he had settled this other
affair, and his father refused even to visit the old farm without him.
In the meanwhile, too, Mr. Van Patten became insistent. He had been
able to see his daughter and sister for the first time in three years,
and now was eager almost to the point of petulance to see his son.
He could not understand why the boy couldn’t come down for a day at
least. It was becoming more and more difficult to quiet him. The girl
showed plainly enough in her letters the distress under which they all
labored. Matters were fast reaching a crisis.

It was at this point that he received the wire from Eleanor.

“Joe on way home. Don’t know when he will get here. You’d better come
back if you can.”

Come back? Nothing else counted. He found his mother in her
dressing-room kneeling before a trunk filled with old letters.

“Mother,” he whispered, “I take the next train for Chester.”

She looked up with moist eyes.

“Give her--my love,” she said.

“But mother--”

“No matter how it turns out, Dick. My boy loves her, so--I love her
too.”

“Tell Dad,” choked Barnes, “I haven’t time to see him.”

Barnes boarded the train with all the excitement of a boy making his
first journey. He took a seat in the smoking-car, filled his pipe,
and adjusting his knees comfortably against the wooden card-table
before him, settled down to deep reflection. A man with an obtrusive
arrangement of a large dress-suit case and much rattling of newspapers
took the seat facing him. He would meet her, Barnes dreamed, in the
sitting-room. She would wear her China silk with the polka dots in
it. It would be at about sunset time, so that the gold in her hair
would be more than ever in evidence as it always was when the sun took
it slantwise. The ivory forehead would be flushed with the lightest
crimson; her lips would be like damson preserves; and she would hold
herself like a Venetian noblewoman.

His thoughts were interrupted by the voice of the stranger.

“The lies which are circulated about Alaska,” declared the latter with
spirit, “would fill a book.”

Barnes glanced up at the man with some interest. He saw a young fellow
with a decent if somewhat brazen face. His wide felt hat was set at a
rakish angle and his clothes were a trifle over emphasized. The fellow
was evidently referring to something he had read in the New York paper
which he held in his big hand.

“They ought to jail men who slander a country like that,” he further
declared.

“What’s the trouble?” inquired Barnes.

“Trouble? Why, the man who wrote this couldn’t have been within a
thousand miles of Alaska. The stuff is libel--nothing else. You’d think
from this that the place was up near the North Pole somewhere; you’d
think all we had to eat was icicles; you’d think we lived in huts and
wore a couple of feet of fur the year round. You’d think we were all a
gang of wild Indians who wouldn’t know a street car by sight.”

“Well,” observed Barnes, straightening up, “I suppose you _do_ lack
many of the modern conveniences.”

“Not by a good deal,” answered the stranger with heat. “We’ve got
everything a red-blooded man needs.”

“You hail from Alaska yourself?” inquired Barnes with growing interest.

“You bet I do.”

“Ever happen to hear of a town called ‘The Last Chance’?”

“Heard of it? Why, I live there.”

“Then,” faltered Barnes, “did you ever happen to hear of one Van
Patten?”

He held his breath for the answer.

“Hear of it? Why, that’s my name!”

“Not Joe Van Patten?”

“Joe Van Patten.”

Barnes pressed down the ashes in his pipe. He relighted the tobacco
with deliberate carefulness.

“You seem to know me,” broke in the young man uneasily, “but I’m hanged
if I remember you.”

“No. My name is Barnes. I met your family a while ago.”

“Is that a fact?” exclaimed Van Patten.

The information seemed to check rather than promote loquaciousness on
the part of the young man. He settled back uneasily in his seat and
drummed nervously on the table. Barnes discerned now a certain family
resemblance which would have been more pronounced had the man been
in more conventional Eastern garb. There was nothing in his face to
indicate viciousness--at worst nothing but stubbornness and selfishness.

“I understand you’re interested in mining?” began Barnes, in the hope
of getting him to talk again.

“Up to my neck.”

“You left ‘The Lucky Find’ well?” he inquired much as John had inquired
of him.

“You mean to say they haven’t heard back here of the strike?”

“Strike?”

“‘The Lucky Find,’” announced Van Patten, “is to-day the best paying
mine within a hundred miles of ‘The Last Chance.’”

Barnes nodded. After all, when analyzed, that was not necessarily a
very rash statement.

“Why, look here,” exclaimed Van Patten, “take a peek at this.”

And before Barnes’ astonished gaze Van Patten spread out one of the
identical gorgeous certificates which he himself had described to Aunt
Philomela. There it was within touch--the very thing he had seen the
man draw out when sitting in the hut by the side of three-fingered
Bill. He was glad to have one thing at least substantiated. It was
swirled over with a bewildering design of engraved spirals. Across
its face the name of the mine was dashed in a flourishing script
that reminded him of the exhibition writing of an old-time teacher
of penmanship. Each certificate proclaimed that it represented one
hundred shares of stock in ‘The Lucky Find’--par value one hundred
dollars. Barnes held the crinkling papers in his hand a moment as
though suspecting still that this was only some particularly vivid
piece of dreaming.

“Just had these made in New York,” explained Van Patten.

“They are very pretty,” commented Barnes.

“And growing prettier every day,” answered Van Patten. “That stock is
at a premium. A month ago we struck it rich--real gold this time.”

The man spoke as though he, at least, believed it.

“That ought to be good news for the stockholders,” said Barnes,
thinking of John.

“It will put every mother’s son of ’em where they need do no more
worrying,” declared Van Patten proudly.

He sank back comfortably into his seat as though this statement settled
satisfactorily most of the big affairs of the universe.

If what the boy said was true, Barnes was very glad for those back in
the mellow brick house. It would simplify Aunt Philomela’s accounts and
make John’s gray hairs less pathetic.

“You came East to place your stock on the market?” inquired Barnes with
fresh suspicion.

“I’ve come back to make good,” answered Van Patten. “I’ve come back to
pay some of my debts.”

“That ought to make you a welcome visitor.”

“I don’t know,” faltered Van Patten with what appeared to be more or
less genuine emotion. “I can’t say that I’ve used my folks very well.”

“How long since you’ve been home?” asked Barnes.

“Not for years.”

“Years?”

“Dad and I had a bit of a scrap, and I cut.”

“Heard from him lately?”

“A month or so ago I got a letter. He was sick and wanted me to come
home, but I was strapped and I couldn’t. It was just before we made the
strike. I wouldn’t tell him I was busted. When you quit home with your
dander up, you want to make good before you come back, don’t you?”

“It saves your pride,” admitted Barnes.

He met Van Patten’s eyes with frank friendliness. He found himself
beginning to sympathize in a way with the man.

“I suppose Dad thought I didn’t use him very well,” ran on Van Patten,
“but that can’t be helped now. I’ll square things with him when I see
him.”

Barnes waited.

“Say,” exclaimed Van Patten with enthusiasm, “I’m going to give the
Dad the time of his life in these next few years. I’m going to show
him something of this country. He’s been too busy to travel, but
I’m going to make him go back to Alaska with me. Why, do you know
we’ve got a country up there as large as all the United States east
of the Mississippi river if you take out Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, North Carolina, and West Virginia?”

“Yes,” answered Barnes, mildly. “I knew that.”

“Why, there’s over half a million square miles up there.”

“To be exact, five hundred and eighty-six miles.”

Van Patten leaned forward.

“Say, stranger,” he exclaimed, “do you come from there?”

“In a way.”

“Where’s your claim?”

“I--well, you see I haven’t located it yet.”

“How long you been down?”

“Not long.”

“Give us your hand.”

Barnes extended his hand.

“I wish we were traveling farther the same way,” declared Van Patten.

The train was even then drawing close to the little station huddled in
among the houses. Van Patten began to gather up his traps.

“I get off here,” explained Van Patten.

Barnes, too, rose.

“So do I,” he announced.




CHAPTER XXIII

A YOUNG PRODIGAL COMES HOME


Once upon the platform, Van Patten looked around with the query,

“Which way you going?”

“Up your way,” answered Barnes, nodding in the direction of the brick
house. “Won’t you walk a bit with me?”

“I don’t know but what I will,” answered the other. “I haven’t anything
but a dress-suit case, and I feel like stretching my legs.”

Barnes led the way, and the other fell into step at his side. The road
was going in the right direction now. It was as though every dusty
fern, every whispering birch, every stalwart pine pointed towards the
brick house. And Eleanor herself seemed very close to him. It was as
though she were keeping pace the other side of him. How the old world
sang of her! The sun was dropping towards the horizon line, seeking, as
he knew, her black hair. An oriole, high in an elm, was caroling her
name. The lazy locusts were rattling like gray-haired crones over their
tea--of her.

He felt his attitude towards Van Patten changing. The keen sentences
which he had framed by the bedside of the sick father lost their edge
with every foot he neared her. All the passion and bitterness went
from them. There still remained the fact of the thoughtless wording
of the letter, but he seemed to be less and less the man to play the
judge upon it. This man by his side was not he whom he had pictured
by the letter-box. Yet he kept repeating to himself that the son had
not come back at a sick man’s call; that he had left his father to
his loneliness. There still remained the duty, which surely fell upon
him rather than her, of telling this man what had happened. He braced
himself to this task.

“Lord,” exclaimed Van Patten after they had proceeded the matter of a
hundred rods in silence, “father will be surprised. Eleanor wrote that
his eyes had gone back on him. It’s hard luck to be blind at such a
time of year, isn’t it?”

“I think there’s also a bit of a surprise waiting for _you_,” said
Barnes.

The boy stopped in his tracks.

“A surprise?” he repeated anxiously. “You don’t mean to tell me that
father--that anything--”

“He has partially recovered his sight,” put in Barnes, glad to relieve
the look in the young man’s eyes.

Van Patten dropped his suit-case. He took out a handkerchief and ran it
over his forehead.

“Gad!” he exclaimed. “You frightened me. But that--why, that’s the best
news ever. That’s something like.”

“There’s still another surprise,” began Barnes. “I--perhaps we’d better
sit down here by the side of the road a minute. There are two or three
things you ought to know before you see your father.”

“What’s that?”

“Nothing serious,” Barnes reassured him, “but what I’ve got to tell you
may strike you as a bit queer. I haven’t got used to it yet myself.”

Barnes sat down beneath a big pine and Van Patten, watching him
uneasily, took a place beside him.

“You see,” began Barnes, “when your letter came a month ago, affairs at
the house were in a bad way.”

“Guess I was a bit hasty in that letter,” stammered Van Patten.

“Under the circumstances, you were,” agreed Barnes. “Your father was in
bad shape--sort of pining away for you.”

“For me? I didn’t think he cared that much.”

“He cared a great deal,” said Barnes. “So, for that reason, we didn’t
show him your letter.”

“You didn’t?” exclaimed Van Patten eagerly.

“We tore it up.”

Van Patten gave a sigh of relief, but the next second he looked
curiously at this stranger who evidently had played so important a part
in his personal affairs.

“Excuse me,” he said finally, “but just where did _you_ come in?”

“At the arrival of the letter,” answered Barnes. “I happened to be
passing.”

“Where?”

“The letter-box.”

“But I don’t see--”

“Your sister received the letter. She was crying over it when I came
along. She was afraid if she read it to your father it would kill him.”

“Gee! I didn’t know it was that bad. I was busted and sore and--but I
didn’t mean to make it that bad.”

“Sometimes letters sound worse than we intend when we write them.”

“But you?” persisted Van Patten.

“I was a stranger, but when I heard your sister crying, I stopped. She
was very much excited, and on the spur of the moment she confided in
me. I advised her to tear up the letter.”

“Thank God for that!” exclaimed the boy, “but I don’t see yet where you
came in.”

“Then we talked over how we could prevent your father from knowing you
didn’t intend to come home. You see if he had learned that he would
have just dropped his head back on the pillow and died.”

“And I thought he never wanted to lay eyes on me again!”

“He grew young while he was sick,” explained Barnes. “He came back home
while he was sick, and he wanted you again.”

“But how did you manage it? How--”

“I played the prodigal,” explained Barnes, simply. “I took your part.”

“You made him believe you were me?”

“Exactly.”

“And he _did_ believe it?”

“He was blind and very anxious. So he believed.”

For a moment Van Patten stared at Barnes in silence. Then he stammered,

“Stranger, I reckon I owe you more than Dad does.”

“Neither of you owes me anything,” answered Barnes.

“We’ll settle that later,” said Van Patten, earnestly. “But Dad--didn’t
he call your bluff at all?”

“No. I left when his sight began to improve.”

“How’d you work that?”

“I told him I had to go to New York on business. From New York I wired
you, and--here you are.”

“I never got your wires,” answered Van Patten, “but, thank God, here I
am.”

“You’ll have to back me up in what I told him about Alaska,” smiled
Barnes.

“Lord,” gasped Van Patten, “you did go the limit. But trust me to play
out the game.”

Barnes stared dreamily across the road.

“I suppose,” he hesitated, “I ought to go along with you for a day or
two.”

“I’ll need you,” said the boy, reaching for his hand.

“But your father mustn’t meet me. It won’t do to allow him to make
comparisons. Once he sees you with his own eyes, he’ll put aside all
doubts. The others will have to know, of course, but we can keep them
quiet.”

“The others?” questioned Van Patten.

“Carl, for one,” answered Barnes. “Your sister, I understand, is
engaged.”

“Sis engaged?”

Van Patten made his feet.

“I guess,” he said, “it’s time I got home right away.”

The two started again and on the rest of the short walk Barnes devoted
himself more to details. As well as he was able, Barnes sketched
rapidly the minor events of those two weeks and repeated once more
stories he had made up for the father. Van Patten listened intently,
but he groaned at mention of three-fingered Bill and the description of
the hut.

“Gad!” he exclaimed, “it’s a crime to back up such yarns as those, but
I suppose you did the best you could.”

“The best I could,” answered Barnes, soberly.

“And it’s my fault anyway,” put in the boy quickly. “I’m not long on
religion, but if conversion means anything, I guess it means just the
changed way I feel now about father and home. I’ve got you to thank for
that.”

“I converted myself in the process,” smiled Barnes, “which is more than
some preachers do.”

He passed the place by the road where he had found the girl lying
bruised on the grass, and from this point on, his lips were set. But
when he came in sight once more of the little brick house, his jaws
relaxed a trifle. It looked as warm and peaceful and sunshiny as it had
the first day he saw it. He led the way to the little Dutch door, and
lifted the brass knocker. It sent an echo through the house which was
answered by John. The latter looked both startled and pleased.

“Is Eleanor able to come downstairs?” inquired Barnes.

“Yes, sir. She said she was expectin’ you.”

“Then you’ll ask her to step into the sitting-room?”

Van Patten followed his leader uneasily, and paced the room almost as
though fearing this interview. But when his sister appeared he had
reached her side in a jiffy.

“Sis,” he cried, “I’m back--back home!”

She hesitated the fraction of a second, her eyes upon Barnes. The
latter bowed without speaking.

“Joe,” she murmured doubtfully.

But the boy seized her in his arms almost fiercely.

“You aren’t afraid of me, little sister?” he exclaimed.

“Joe, Joe,” she trembled, and lifted her lips to his.

From upstairs came the fairy tinkle of a silver bell. Barnes started.
The girl looked wildly about.

“That’s Dad,” she exclaimed.

Barnes stepped forward.

“Your father sees quite clearly now?” he asked.

“Yes, yes,” she gasped. “What--what are we going to do?”

“Joe must go to him,” insisted Barnes. “Send Aunt Philomela down to me.”

Joe himself looked frightened. He hesitated.

“Tell your father,” suggested Barnes, “that you’ve had word ‘The Lucky
Find’ is on its feet. He’ll be so glad for you that he’ll forget
everything else.”

“But if he suspects?” gasped Joe.

“If worst comes to worst,” said Barnes, “send for me. We’ll have to
tell him then.”

Joe turned towards the door. Barnes placed his hand upon the young
man’s shoulder.

“Keep your nerve,” he warned, “and play the game hard. That’s what
we’ve all been doing here--even Aunt Philomela.”

Eleanor escorted her brother to the old man’s room and without waiting
came down immediately with her aunt. Both women were quite breathless.
They stood close together as though half expecting to hear a scream.
Barnes crossed at once to Aunt Philomela and took her frail hand.

“Buck up,” he advised. “The boy will carry it through.”

“Oh,” she answered, “I’m so glad that _you_ are here!”

“Thank you,” answered Barnes. “Hadn’t you both better be seated?”

Aunt Philomela obeyed humbly and took a chair near the window. Eleanor
remained standing by her side.

Barnes thought the girl looked paler than when he had left. She seemed
less sure of herself. The strain of the last few weeks had told upon
her. He felt a strange lightness of the head as he noticed these
things. The phrases he had formulated to say on the way down here all
vanished and in their place came a dozen swift sentences which he had
no right to utter. Consequently, he was dumb and the silence became
embarrassing. Aunt Philomela broke the tension a little by exclaiming,

“I wouldn’t live through this last week again for a hundred million
dollars.”

“Nor I,” answered Barnes, briefly.

Aunt Philomela glanced up quickly.

“How does Joe look?” she demanded.

“Not at all as I feared,” stammered the girl.

“Blood tells,” nodded Aunt Philomela with a trace of her old spirit.

The two women listened. Barnes himself half expected to hear at any
second the warning tinkle of the silver bell. He roused himself.

“How is Carl’s arm?” he inquired.

Both women started. It was Aunt Philomela who replied,

“It is getting along very well, I believe.”

Miss Van Patten caught her breath and looked away. Barnes noticed it.
He sought her eyes with a question. She flushed scarlet. Upon the
moment he determined to see Carl as soon as he could leave.

Like three discussing a grave crisis in a sick room, they talked on
in strained, jerky little sentences until Joe came down again. At the
boy’s entrance, Aunt Philomela arose. It was clear at a glance that Van
Patten was unnerved, but it was also clear that he had succeeded. He
came direct to Aunt Philomela with his hand extended.

“Well, Joe?” she stammered.

“Aunt,” he answered unsteadily, “I’ve paid big for all my cussedness.”

The little old lady took his hand and patted his shoulder. He turned to
Barnes.

“And, ye gods,” he added solemnly, “Alaska has paid big, too!”




CHAPTER XXIV

MAN TO MAN


As Barnes hurried through the little Dutch door on his way to see
Langdon, he felt like an exchanged prisoner going to rejoin his colors.
He was conscious of one big emotion--that of freedom. However slight
the chances, so long as a man may fight, victory is at least within his
grasp. Yet Barnes was neither confident nor even sanguine. His thoughts
did not go so far as to speculate upon the result. It was enough that
he need no longer remain passive.

His plan was simple. He would tell Langdon the whole story and claim
the rights of which he had been deprived. He would claim the privilege
of ignoring the engagement which had not yet been publicly announced,
which had not as yet even been announced to her father, so far as it
might restrict him in any honorable approach to the girl. He would make
Langdon see that he did not do this presumptuously, but simply on the
ground that he was entitled to fight for his pictures as Langdon fought
for his symphonies. Eleanor would, of course, remain in ignorance
of the agreement. She was unrestrained by any code and so could then
choose, if at all, as her heart dictated.

Barnes found Langdon dressed and sitting in the sun before the house
with his arm in a sling. He had lost both weight and color. He greeted
Barnes with what seemed like a genuine welcome.

“I guess we’re all glad to see you back, Joe,” he said earnestly.
“They’ve been devilish uneasy up at the other house without you.”

“I don’t wonder,” answered Barnes. “Some devilish queer things have
been happening up there during these last few weeks.”

Carl glanced up quickly.

“What do you mean?” he demanded.

Barnes sat down on the turf a little way from Langdon and stared at the
saffron road. The tawny ribbon seemed such an integral part of all the
strange occurrences of this last month that he turned to it now, as to
a comrade, for help in explaining.

“In some ways,” he began, “because you’re an artist it makes it easier
to tell you; but in other ways that fact makes it harder.”

Langdon leaned forward anxiously.

“What’s the trouble?” he demanded. “Is anything wrong--up there?”

“I don’t know about that,” answered Barnes, “but something is wrong
right here.”

“With you, Joe?”

“With you and me,” answered Barnes.

Langdon paused for a moment, and then, through half-closed lips, he
groaned, “Yes, something is wrong with me. But how did you know?”

Barnes lifted his eyes and studied the strained white face of the
other. It was his turn to be surprised. He glanced at the bandaged arm.

Langdon shook his head.

“No,” he answered, “it isn’t that.”

“Then--”

“It’s your sister, Joe,” explained Langdon. “There’s something about
her I don’t understand. She hasn’t been herself since you left.”

Barnes interrupted him.

“Don’t tell me any more,” he commanded.

“I’ve been waiting for this chance to talk it over with you, Joe.”

“I haven’t any right to listen,” Barnes hurried on. “But I have
something to say to you--that--that may help you out. Only I don’t know
just how to begin. I want you to understand, in the first place, that
we’ve all been as square as we knew how--that what has happened has
been, in a way, inevitable.”

Langdon sat as fixed as a marble statue. Barnes turned his eyes back to
the saffron road.

“You see,” he began, “it all came about by chance. I was walking along
this road when I found her by the letter-box, crying.”

“Found who?” demanded Langdon.

“Eleanor. She had just received a letter from her brother, saying he
wouldn’t come home.”

Langdon looked dazed.

“From her brother?”

“From Joe. You see I’m not her brother at all.”

Langdon rose slowly from his chair. Barnes too rose. He forgot for
the moment his own rights in this matter. He felt as though he were
confessing to an imposition. It occurred to him that this was just the
way that Aunt Philomela must have first looked upon the plan.

“Then who the devil are you?” demanded Langdon, aggressively.

“No relation to the family at all,” answered Barnes. “To you--just a
fellow artist.”

Langdon turned his eyes towards the brick house. He repeated almost
automatically,

“No relation at all. Just a fellow artist.”

“And Joe himself,” ran on Barnes, “is up there now. He came back
to-day.”

Langdon tottered. Barnes seized his arm.

“Sit down, old man,” he urged.

But Langdon shook himself free and stepping back a pace stared like a
man at bay. The attitude helped Barnes to justify himself again. They
stood now man to man.

“Langdon,” said Barnes, quietly, “the position was easier for you than
it was for me. I was forced to listen--”

“You might have saved me from confiding in you,” broke in Langdon
through half-closed lips.

“Saved you?” answered Barnes. “Don’t you think I would have saved
myself that, if it had been possible?”

“It must have seemed like a good joke to you,” said Langdon.

Barnes caught his breath.

“No,” he answered slowly, “it wasn’t much of a joke.”

He hesitated and then went on,

“Perhaps when I’m done, you can see just how much of a joke it was.”

Langdon stepped forward.

“You don’t mean--”

Barnes nodded.

“Exactly,” he answered. “I mean that all the time I have felt the same
towards Eleanor that you do. I mean that I have been fighting for my
pictures just as you have been fighting for your symphonies. The
difference is that--until Joe came back--I have had to fight myself,
too. I have had to stand back helpless and look on.”

“And now?” demanded Langdon.

Barnes took a long breath. He met Langdon’s hot eyes steadily.

“And now,” he said, “I’ve come to claim my rights.”

“What are they?” inquired Langdon.

“The privilege of making my love known to her--the privilege of winning
her if I can. The privilege,” he added slowly, “of putting that sunrise
we looked at together into colors as you would put it into music.”

For a moment Langdon stared at him in silence. Then he groped for his
chair. He sat leaning forward with his forehead in his hand. When he
finally looked up, his face was set.

“Yes,” he agreed. “I think you have that right.”

“That and nothing more,” replied Barnes. “I don’t want you to think
that Eleanor herself has--has given me any encouragement in this.”

“Not even--since you’ve come back?”

“I’ve not had time to exchange a half dozen words with her since then.”

Langdon relapsed into silence and Barnes hurried on. He was very
anxious to make himself clearly understood. He didn’t want Langdon to
think he was taking an unfair advantage.

“Langdon,” he said, “I’m afraid I’m not chivalrous enough to wish you
success. It’s too serious a business for both of us. But I can say
frankly that I want the girl to choose for her own happiness. And I
don’t see a pennyworth of difference between us. We are both artists;
we are both honest; we have both, I should say, about the same amount
of talent whatever that may count; we offer her about the same things.
We’d both buckle down to make her happy for all there is in us.”

“I don’t think women choose for those things,” answered Langdon, dully.

“Nor I neither,” agreed Barnes. “I don’t know how they choose. Perhaps
they don’t choose at all. We hold out the straws and they draw. All is
I want to put my straw in with yours, Langdon. I want a chance--because
of all it means to me and my pictures.”

Langdon rose wearily.

“There isn’t much use discussing it,” he said. “You’re right--devilish
right.”

Barnes hesitated about offering his hand.

“We can’t go ahead exactly as friends,” he faltered, “but we needn’t be
enemies, need we?”

“No,” answered Langdon. “But I don’t think anything we ourselves may do
consciously will play a very important part in the affair.”

“Nor I either. So here’s my hand to a fellow artist anyway.”

Langdon took it.

“I’ll see you off and on during the next few weeks I suppose,” said
Barnes, “but there’s no need of ever bringing this up again.”

Langdon straightened himself.

“I didn’t get your name,” he observed with something of a smile.

“Barnes.”

“Mr. Barnes, I ought to tell you that whatever formal engagement
existed between Miss Van Patten and myself has already been canceled.”

“Good Lord,” exploded Barnes. “You mean--”

“That we found we had been over hasty. That is all. There has been
no--misunderstanding.”

“But you--”

“I still mean to make her my wife if she concludes it is for her
happiness. This new development may help her to decide.”

“Why that’s great,” exclaimed Barnes. “Then we’re both back on our
mark.”

“Yes,” answered Langdon, grimly. “And I’m going in now to telephone
her.”

“And I,” concluded Barnes. “I guess I’ll go back to the house.”

“Good-day, Barnes.”

“Good-day, Langdon,” answered Barnes.

And turning abruptly Barnes swung off down the road at as fast a pace
as he could make.




CHAPTER XXV

THE PURPLE RIM


Langdon had mentioned thus casually a turn in the affairs of Eleanor
which to the girl herself marked a crisis. It is no small matter when
one awakes to the realization that one does not understand oneself. And
this is especially true when one’s life hitherto has been as simple as
the rule of three. Suddenly to discover that one is complex--to face in
a flash the mystifying X in life’s equations--is to grow from a girl to
a woman in a minute.

That eventful morning a week ago when Carl had appeared to her
pale-faced and looking like a wounded soldier and had made his sharp,
fervent plea, she had answered out of a full heart and as to an old
friend, “Yes.” It came as a simple almost inevitable climax. It did not
seem a momentous decision; it had involved no great fluttering of the
heart. When she conveyed the news to Aunt Philomela, the latter had for
a moment looked surprised, then thoughtful, and finally had solemnly
patted her hand with the remark, “Well, my dear, you will be safe with
him at any rate.”

For an hour after this she had lain prone upon the sofa pondering her
aunt’s observation. Yes, she would feel safe. Already she felt safe.
She felt again, as she did as a little girl, that she was living in
a cup bounded by the horizon line. What lay beyond did not concern
her. There would be no adventuring over that purple rim. Should they
ever venture forth, Carl would precede her like a courier and at every
station have things ready for her comfort. Her life would move forward
as steadily, as calmly as it now did.

It was at this point that Barnes had come in with the news of his
intended departure. He had broken in upon her lazy reflections with his
usual disconcerting impetuosity. And as usual, too, he had seemed to
dash from over the horizon line. He had made her feel less as though
this boundary were a protection. He had a way of swooping down from
unexpected angles which was discomforting to one whose habit was to
watch only the main thoroughfare. When Aunt Philomela in a moment of
fretfulness had sputtered out before him the news of her engagement it
had come to her distinctly as more of a surprise than when Carl himself
had proposed. It was as though it were for the first time announced
to herself. It gave her a new sense of responsibility which left her
feeling by no means so secure as before Barnes’ entrance.

Then before she had time to think, Barnes had gone. Aunt Philomela drew
her chair nearer and stroked her hair.

“He’s a queer boy,” she murmured, “and somehow--I’m going to miss him.”

“He’s been very generous to us, Aunty,” she answered.

Aunt Philomela sighed.

“But he is utterly irresponsible,” she hedged.

Both women had a great deal with which to occupy themselves during
the next few days but they moved always with a sense of insecurity.
Carl came over often but there was not much he could do. In all little
things he was thoughtful and he gave them both a great deal of good
advice about not worrying and not overtaxing their strength.

So a week passed and Eleanor did not sleep well at night. Yet for the
life of her she could not tell why. She had evil dreams about being
stifled, about being tied hand and foot awaiting some awful doom. Once
she called out so loudly in her sleep as to rouse Aunt Philomela. The
latter crept in timidly with a frightened question on her lips,

“What is it, dearie?”

The girl reached out for her aunt’s hand.

“Oh, I don’t know,” she groaned, “there seemed to be something--”

“A Thing?” interrupted Aunt Philomela.

“An uncanny thing.”

Aunt Philomela recovered her spirit.

“You don’t mean to tell me that Mr. Barnes--”

“Barnes?” interrupted the girl as though the name offered some vague
explanation.

“Has he been filling your head full of that nonsense as he did John’s?”

The girl smiled. The room seemed instantly as full of fresh air as
though a window had been opened.

“No,” she answered, “it isn’t that. Get back into bed, Aunty, or you’ll
catch cold.”

Aunt Philomela reluctantly obeyed and the girl fell into a deep sleep
which remained uninterrupted until dawn. Then she crept to the window.
It seemed more like a sunset than a sunrise she was watching.

For the next day or two she used Carl abominably. It was impossible
for her to see him. Yet he was very patient--very sweet. He wrote her
quiet, tender little notes and spent most of his time downstairs with
Aunt Philomela. The latter came up one evening with her face set.

“Eleanor,” she snapped, “what I need is to get good and vexed once
more.”

“What do you mean, Aunty?”

“I mean I almost ordered Mary to spill some hot tea on Carl.”

“You what?”

“I did,” she continued uncompromisingly.

“If Mr. Barnes--”

“I wish to goodness he’d drop in for an hour this very evening.”

Eleanor looked up brightly,

“It might clear the air,” she suggested.

Aunt Philomela was thoughtful a moment. Then she observed, “I think in
the morning you had better see Carl.”

So the next morning she had received Carl. He was very solicitous as to
what had caused her relapse and she, acting upon a sudden inspiration,
tried to admit him into the secret of her thoughts.

“Carl,” she said frankly, “I don’t know what has come over me. Honestly
I don’t. But ever since our--our engagement I’ve felt stifled. It may
be just hysteria. But I’ve felt all hemmed in.”

He took her hand.

“I think I know what it is,” he said tenderly. “You feel as though you
had been made a prisoner?”

“Is it that?” she questioned eagerly.

“Yes. That is it,” he decided. “Living here so much by yourself these
last few years you’ve been very free. But I don’t want to feel that now
I bind you in anyway.”

“You don’t. That’s what I can’t understand.” She frowned and then went
on, “Why I’m just as free as ever I was. I can move about as I wish; I
can do what I choose. There’s nothing I wish to do that I can’t do. I
guess I’m just silly.”

Carl shook his head.

“When we’re gripped with an idea like yours, it isn’t silly no matter
how inexplicable it is.”

“You know how I feel?” she asked anxiously.

“Yes,” he answered, “you feel caged.”

“Yes,” she answered, “it’s that.”

It was wonderful how fully he understood her. She felt even now when
talking with him as though talking to herself.

“And you know how to cure me?” she asked with a little laugh.

He nodded.

“How?” she asked anxiously.

“By leaving the cage door open,” he answered quickly. She caught her
breath.

“You mean--?”

“There is no need of our being formally engaged. We can go on just as
we have until we decide to get married--”

She drew back a little. He put in quickly, “We needn’t even consider
that now. We’ll be just friends until the whole matter solves itself.”

“And it will solve itself?” she asked eagerly.

“Yes,” he replied unhesitatingly.

She drew a deep breath. The cage door was even now open.

“Carl,” she whispered honestly, “already I feel less afraid.”

Thus what had appeared to her a very serious problem was settled in
five minutes. And it left her not one whit more comfortable. As she
thought of it during the day, the very fact of Carl’s acquiescence
piqued her. If the matter had been settled after a hearty quarrel she
would have felt twice as free. As it was she was under obligations to
his good nature if nothing else.

It was at this point that Carl began to lose weight; it was at this
point that Eleanor began to realize that in some way Carl had for once
misunderstood her. The discontent which oppressed her was by no means
based upon such girlish hysteria as they had both supposed. But once
at this conclusion she was no better able to analyze her condition
than before. Her fretful nights began again and once again she found
herself straining towards something bigger and more intangible than had
ever before come into her life. She still felt herself caged and this
time it was by nothing less distant than the purple rim itself.

She did not discuss this with Carl. She did not mention it even to
Aunt Philomela. Alone with herself in the dark she struggled to find
meaning in it and as she struggled she discovered herself a wilder more
irrational being than she had ever imagined existed.

For one thing her thoughts went back again and again to the saffron
road. Until now this path had been significant only as furnishing a
means of approach to the house or a convenient way of access to the
green-grocer at the next village. But during the long nights which
followed, it called to her in a more venturesome spirit. She saw it
stretching mile upon mile beyond Chester, saw it winding through the
valleys and up the hills and across mountain ranges to the sea. It did
not stop even here. A big boat came down to meet her and carried her
across the ocean where she again picked up the trail. She felt one with
De Soto and Champlain; one with all those who press on through strange
countries in their adventuring. And as she moved on she was upon wings
and was unafraid.

Yet Barnes--Yes, it was Barnes who had shown her the way--had pointed
out the dangers.

“My soul,” he had exclaimed, “the dangers are innumerable and
terrifying.”

But now as she thought of them, she laughed back at him. He had spoken
of chasms and glaciers and tangles and thorns and Indians. Well, what
of them? She joyed at thought of pitting her strength of limb against
them. She thrilled at prospect of scrambling over them and straight on.
To what? It did not matter. She was in a state of primeval rebellion.
She yearned to get beyond these flower-bordered paths, beyond these
sheltered walls. Carl had left the cage open but in the meanwhile, even
while beating her wings against the bars, she had found some new power.
The cage door was open and she had no desire to hop back again among
the flowers where before she had been content. She had seen the purple
of the sky through the wires and now she hungered to soar.

Still it was all very vague. It was like a dream from which we awake
with a distinct emotion of abstract horror or joy without being able to
recall the details which cause the mood.

If, at times, Barnes intruded himself into the sacred mystery of these
thoughts she then instantly regained control of herself. They were of
too intimate stuff to share. He made her self-conscious. He made her
uncomfortable.

Yet at other times she thought of him a great deal. She wondered about
that tragedy in his eyes which Carl had pointed out to her. She had
noticed it particularly the day Barnes had left. If ever a man’s eyes
expressed a secret woe, his did then. He had seen a great deal of the
world and it would be small wonder if during that time he had met
someone--someone--

She found it difficult to be more concrete. There were a great many
different kinds of women and it would be very hard to visualize her
whom such a man might choose. She might be tall or slight or dark or
brunette or--she doubted if her appearance would matter very much to
such a man. She might be gay or shy, learned or untutored, rich or
poor. She doubted if any of those things would matter much to such a
man.

It was impossible to conceive just what _would_ matter but she was
quite sure that whatever did, would matter a great deal. Love would be
with him a big emotion and if it went wrong, it would be a big tragedy.
Carl had seen it and she herself had caught traces of it in the letters
he had written to her father. This week, with its problems, left her
strangely eager for his return.




CHAPTER XXVI

AUNT PHILOMELA GAMBLES


Though Mr. Van Patten improved steadily during the week after
Barnes’ return, the old gentleman did not venture from his room. Joe
remained daily by his side from morning until bedtime, with a view to
establishing himself so firmly in his father’s mind that if ever it
became necessary to introduce Barnes in his proper person it would
not be possible for the father to make comparisons. The possibility
of such a contingency was really slight. The original deception had
been practiced upon Mr. Van Patten’s touch and hearing, and whatever
discrepancies of evidence based on these might bob up would have little
weight against what the father was now able to see for himself. As
for contradictions in the narrative, the father’s memory was weak and
Barnes had appealed almost wholly to his emotions. It was really not
until now that Mr. Van Patten had been able to fix his attention at all
upon details.

Yet it was thought advisable not to let him know that a guest was in
the house. This was no very difficult matter and involved nothing but
a certain amount of caution. Aunt Philomela, who had quite recovered
her spirits, disapproved of it on general principles but admitted the
wisdom of the course.

“I don’t expect to see the end of this until I’m in my grave,” she
avowed.

“Nor I,” admitted Barnes.

“And I shall consider myself very lucky if I do then.”

“And I--” Barnes paused. “Well, after all,” he went on, “that depends
upon how it all turns out.”

Aunt Philomela looked at him curiously. She had looked at him curiously
a great many times this last week. Barnes drew from his pocket a
handful of loose matches. He began to arrange them with their heads in
one direction.

“I have an embarrassment of riches,” he observed.

“I’m not sure that I like that new game you taught me,” snapped Aunt
Philomela.

“It helps one to forget the duets,” suggested Barnes.

“You won most of those matches when you didn’t have anything at all in
your hand,” commented Aunt Philomela.

“There is little skill in winning when you hold a Royal Straight Flush.”

“I held four aces and even then you won.”

“Because you didn’t have the courage of your convictions,” explained
Barnes. “I had only a pair of deuces that time.”

Aunt Philomela’s eyes snapped dangerously.

“Then,” she asserted, “I consider your gains decidedly ill gotten.”

“If you had only called me.”

“After you shoved forward a whole handful of matches as though you held
all the cards in the pack?”

“That is the game. All is fair in love and--”

“Love!” snapped Aunt Philomela in disgust.

But she was interrupted in further comment by the entrance of Eleanor.
She had often been interrupted in further comment this last week by the
entrance of Eleanor.

The girl had regained her color at a wonderful rate these last few
days. This may have been due to the rapid recovery her father was
making, or it may have been due to the return of her brother and the
good news he brought of ‘The Lucky Find,’ or it may have been due to
Carl, who was noticeably assiduous in his attentions. Barnes spent a
great deal of time trying to make out which it was. Last night she
had played duets with Carl until ten o’clock, while Barnes and Aunt
Philomela sat at cards in the next room.

“Are you at liberty this morning?” inquired Barnes of Miss Van Patten.

“I don’t know what Aunty has planned for me,” she said dutifully.

“As though what I planned for anyone mattered,” exploded Aunt Philomela.

“I’m sure,” murmured Barnes, “that so far we have all of us followed
your plans to the letter.”

“So far?”

“From the beginning,” nodded Barnes. “From the moment you sent me
upstairs to see Mr. Van Patten.”

“I? I sent you upstairs? I’m responsible for this whole affair?”

“But for your orders I should have gone on again along the saffron
road.”

“Well, of all the--”

But Eleanor effectively stifled her aunt’s righteous indignation by
putting her arms about the thin shoulders.

“There, Aunty, dear,” she wheedled, “don’t mind him. Now, I’ll do
anything you say. Do you wish me to help you with your accounts?”

“Or,” put in Barnes, “do you wish us to catch you a fish?”

Aunt Philomela rose to her feet and swept grandly towards the door.

“A fish by all means,” she answered.

At the door she paused and added:

“I have no doubt that Mr. Barnes will find it unnecessary to use even
so much as a hook in his fishing.”

She hurried out leaving the girl staring in amazement at Barnes.

“At cards last night,” explained Barnes, “I won fifty-three sulphur
matches from your Aunt--mostly by bluffing.”

“Oh,” she murmured in relief, “that explains it.”

“You’ll come with me?”

She hesitated.

“The sun is almost too bright for fishing,” she faltered.

“The sun is not too bright to go down by the brook,” he asserted.

“But if we go, we shall have to fish,” she exclaimed instantly.

“Very well,” he agreed. “We will fish even if we catch nothing.”

She went to the closet and brought out her big hat, the fishing-poles,
the book of flies, the basket, and, this time, the landing-net. At
sight of it he drew a deep breath. It recalled to him his oath to the
king trout. He must keep true to that no matter what complications it
brought about.

And she, as she gathered the things together, grew uneasy. That,
however, was nothing unusual. She could not recall a minute in his
presence when she had ever felt anything else. One never knew what
he was going to say next or what odd turn he would give the simplest
platitudes of conversation. She felt much safer when Aunt Philomela was
near except that even then he would generally contrive some argument
that ended by involving them all. No--she could not honestly say that
she was any the happier for having Aunt Philomela at hand. She could
not say honestly that she did not now look forward to a morning with
Barnes by the side of Schuyler brook. She anticipated it with a degree
of pleasure that in itself was discomforting. She did not trust herself
as she did three weeks ago.

In the meanwhile she had put on her hat and again succeeded in tying
beneath her chin a most wonderful bow-knot.

“I haven’t learned yet how to do that,” commented Barnes.

“Do what?” she inquired, not recalling the former incident.

“Tie a bow-knot that will come untied when you wish.”

“Have you practiced?”

“No,” he admitted.

“Then?”

“I must still limit myself to tying such things as are my own.”

“That is wisest,” she agreed.

And without giving him time to base any embarrassing argument upon
this, she led the way out of the little Dutch door. Here the Princess
joined them. The big yellow cat had taken a fancy to Barnes of late and
was to be seen quite as often in his company as in that of his mistress.

The girl forced a brisk path through the field-grass in as matter of
fact a way as though in reality a fish for Aunt Philomela was the only
thing in the world that concerned her. Lag as he might it did little
good, and in no time they had reached the brook.

It was quite obvious to Barnes that the stream took no interest
whatever in the affairs of the brick house from which it derived
its name. Its business was solely with water-cress, white pebbles,
and golden sand. It was whimpling on its placid course just as
unconcernedly as it did three weeks before. If Barnes expected
any encouragement here for the deep matters he had in hand he was
disappointed.

Eleanor proceeded at once to put her pole together and Barnes
reluctantly followed. She paused as he handed her the fly-book.

“You had such good luck before--” she suggested.

“That,” he answered, “was an especial occasion.”

She selected a Silver Moth. As she turned away from him he replaced the
fly-book in the basket, picked out a tiny bit of lead, and, fastening
it to the end of his line, whipped it at once into the water. She
glanced over her shoulder, surprised at the speed he had made, but she
was too late to detect his choice. In another second her own fly was in
the water and Barnes breathed more easily. Then he turned his attention
to a more important matter.

“Eleanor,” he began.

She looked up quickly. The name came to her fraught with new
significance.

“Yes?” she answered.

“I think I have outlived my usefulness as a prodigal.”

“The affair has solved itself in so simple a fashion that I had almost
forgotten that part of it,” she answered.

He looked up from his line. She was turned a little away. When she was
standing there alone with him the matter seemed simple enough to be
sure. It had from the beginning until Carl came in. The problem now was
to find out just what had become of Carl.

“As far as your father is concerned it seems to have straightened out,”
he admitted.

“And as far as Joe is concerned,” she added.

“And Aunt Philomela,” he nodded.

“Yes,” she agreed hastily.

He drew his line from the water and whipped it afresh across the stream.

“Which leaves,” he concluded, “you and Carl and myself.”

She dropped her fly below a clump of alders.

“Are you using a Silver Moth again?” she inquired.

“No,” he confessed.

She followed the bobbing end of his line a second. He allowed it to
sink below the water.

“I can’t make out what you _have_ chosen,” she persisted, squinting her
eyes.

“It’s a secret,” he affirmed mysteriously.

“Oh, pardon me,” she apologized, with some pique.

“Willingly,” he murmured politely.

She seemed disposed to allow both subjects to drop but he with
discomforting insistence reaffirmed,

“Which leaves you and Carl and myself.”

“But you had a talk with Carl?”

“Yes.”

“And though he seems hurt, it is straightened out as well as it can be,
isn’t it?”

“It isn’t straightened out at all,” he answered.

She turned uncomfortably so that she faced him. He met her eyes. She
lowered hers. Then she smiled. It was her only protection.

“You’ll never catch a fish with your line in the bushes,” she declared.

The current had swept the bit of lead down stream into a clump of
grass. He deliberately began to reel in his line.

“I don’t believe I’ll catch a fish anyway,” he decided. “I’ll watch
you.”

“Oh, but that’s what you did before,” she protested.

“And enjoyed it immensely,” he admitted.

“It’s shirking your duties.”

As his line left the water she studied him in surprise.

“Why, you didn’t have on any hook at all,” she exclaimed.

It was impossible to deny the fact in face of the evidence. Without
answering he detached the sinker and continued to reel in his line.
She allowed the Silver Moth to drift into the bushes. He called her
attention to this and she grew very red in the face.

It was quite clear to her now that he had enticed her down here upon a
pretext. She grew embarrassed out of all proportion to any import she
saw in the ruse. She would have been glad if Aunt Philomela had come
along.

“There is you and Carl and myself,” he repeated, as though this were a
sort of apology for his act.

She hastily reeled in her own line. The Princess watched her anxiously.

“Well?” she faltered.

Barnes took a step towards her. At that moment he heard the approach of
someone from behind. He looked about.

“Why,” he exclaimed, “here’s Carl now!”

She almost dropped her pole.

“We’re fishing,” Barnes hastened to explain, in the hope of warding off
the commonplace query which he thought he detected upon Carl’s lips.
But the remark the latter made was anything but commonplace.

“I hurried down here to say good-by to you,” he explained.

He uttered the words with an effort. They seemed no part of him. The
process was purely mechanical.

“Good-by?” exclaimed the girl.

“I take the noon train,” he announced. “From New York I sail to-morrow
for Munich.”

“But I don’t understand!” cried the girl.

Carl turned from her to Barnes.

“Do you?” he demanded.

“Yes,” answered Barnes.

“Then that is enough.”

Barnes took a step forward and seized the boy’s hand.

“I’d fight it out if I were you,” he said below his breath.

“I’ll fight it out in Munich,” he answered grimly.

“Then God help you and--the songs.”

Carl pressed the strong man’s hand that held his.

“There’s no need of praying for you,” he answered.

Eleanor stepped forward in a daze.

“But Carl--” she faltered.

He seized her hand, gripped it for a second, and without a word started
away.

“Carl,” she called after him, “wait! We’re going back to the house with
you.”




CHAPTER XXVII

IN WHICH EVERYONE LEARNS SOMETHING


Twice now Eleanor had seen in a man’s eyes the dumb pain of an
unuttered tragedy,--once when Barnes had gone back to New York; again
this afternoon, when Carl had bade her good-by and been driven off down
the saffron road. In the first case she had played no part, though the
ache of it still haunted her; in the second it was clear that she was
the direct cause. And yet as she stood by the sitting-room window after
supper and retraced this last summer, she saw nothing that she could
have managed differently. Incident had followed incident with apparent
inevitability. Of course she should have been surer of herself before
giving Carl such encouragement, but under the circumstances of the
moment she had acted with what wisdom she then had. The unrest, the
doubts developing into certainty, had followed later.

But argue as she might, she was left with the feeling that she had been
pitifully weak and was decidedly unworthy of the love which had been
offered her. She needed someone in whom to confide--someone to help her
straighten out this tangle. Joe could not help, nor Aunt Philomela,
nor even her father. She thought of just one man who might understand,
and that one man was in the next room talking with her aunt. Even as
she thought of him the one man entered and came across to her side.
Whereupon she murmured an excuse and started to leave. But Barnes
checked her.

“Don’t go,” he pleaded. “You’re worried.”

He had touched her arm just the fraction of a second. She looked
towards the door, startled. She felt very uncomfortable now that she
was alone with the one man. Instead of clarifying matters, he seemed to
complicate them.

“You take Carl’s departure much to heart?” he asked.

“Because I feel very much at fault,” she replied.

She was looking out the window across the rows of bright flowers,
across the green fields, to the horizon line. To Barnes she appeared
like a painting by Rossetti. With her head uplifted, her eyes half
closed, as though in weary confusion, she looked like the Beata Beatrix.

“Because Carl loves you?” he asked suddenly.

She caught her breath. It sounded such a crude, barbaric fact when
he expressed it. She looked for some escape. She prayed that he might
leave her alone. He stood before her as though barring her way.

“No! No!” she exclaimed. “He is mistaken.”

“I do not think he is mistaken,” he answered quietly.

He seemed bent upon depriving her of the one shred of hope to which she
had been clinging. He made her feel even guiltier than before.

“Mr. Barnes,” she pleaded, “let’s not talk of it any more.”

“It’s the only way to settle things,” he answered gently. “There’s no
use of hiding our heads in the sand.”

“But Carl has gone. It’s all settled.”

“No,” he answered deliberately. “It’s still very much mixed up for all
of us. We can’t help Carl very much except by admitting the truth, and
that is that he loves you. He would have made beautiful songs for you
if you had loved him.”

“It’s cruel of you to make me feel so guilty,” she protested.

“You misunderstand,” he said gently. “His love was independent of
anything you did consciously. You would have had to be other than
yourself to have prevented that.”

“I should have known myself better.”

“We can’t correct the past with what we learn, but the Future--there is
where our wisdom counts.”

“What will that count for Carl?” she exclaimed, with a queer little cry.

He thought a moment. Then he shook his head.

“I don’t know,” he answered. “I was thinking only of you.”

“But I--I don’t matter.”

“One thing matters very much for you,” he said.

“And that?” she asked anxiously.

“That you are now sure of yourself; that you are sure you do not really
love him.”

She started, but she did not reply. The stark sunlight which had been
pounding hotly at the earth all day was now fading. The birds were
getting sleepy.

It was at about this time of day that Barnes had first met her. Then
she had been only a strikingly beautiful picture, and now--what a deal
more she was to him now! Until this moment his love for her had seemed
so big that it had been almost impersonal. Circumstances had forced him
to regard it so. It had been almost like some of the big fine dreams he
had dreamed about his Art. Now, in a second, with that question, he
felt her for the first time as a warm, palpitating, human being. As an
artist he had admired her first, then as a mere man, then as a lover;
but now, as he waited for her reply, it was as Richard Barnes that he
loved her. For the first time he had to wrestle hard with himself for
control. He hungered to feel her in his arms, to brush with his lips
the scarlet in her cheeks, which was as rose upon ivory. He yearned
to mingle kisses with the black of her hair, which had gold in it. He
gathered himself together and repeated his question,

“You are sure of that?” he demanded.

There must have been some new quality to his voice, because she shrank
back from him.

“I’m not sure of anything,” she stammered.

The one man frightened her. The one man now drove all thought of Carl
out of her bewildered brain. The one man was in himself a yet keener
problem than any she had so far had to face.

“Eleanor,” he insisted, “that is one thing you must search your soul to
answer.”

“But why must I answer now?” she parried.

“Because,” he said quietly--“because if you love him I must wire him
to-night on my way to Chester.”

“You--you are going, too?”

The words fell from her lips unconsciously.

“If you wish me to bring back Carl,” he answered.

“But I don’t,” she exclaimed. “It wouldn’t do any good to bring him
back.”

She felt his hand upon her arm for the second time.

“You are sure of that?” he demanded.

“Yes. Yes. That is the pity of it.”

“The pity of it,” he answered soberly. Then again, “The pity of it.”

“Don’t you see,” she hurried on, surer of her ground now, “I _ought_ to
love him. There is every reason why I should love him. And yet I don’t.
I can’t.”

She uttered the words as though it were a confession from which she
expected Barnes to withdraw in horror. Leaning forward he searched her
eyes as though once for all to penetrate the hidden gallery of her
heart. She closed her eyes, frightened by his earnestness.

“You are sure of that?” he asked again.

She nodded guiltily.

“It’s a pitiful thing to say,” she murmured, “but it’s true.”

She held her breath to see what he would answer to that. For what
seemed to her an eternity he didn’t say anything. When he did speak she
was almost tempted into hysterical laughter. But she managed to control
herself.

“Why, then,” he said, “let’s go up on the hill back of the house.”

She glanced into his blue eyes. When he led the way she followed. They
went out by the little Dutch door and he closed it behind them. It was
as though he closed a thousand doors behind her.

She stepped into the path, and it seemed to stretch in an endless vista
beyond the top of the hill. She thought of De Soto and La Salle and
Champlain, and knew how they must have felt as they turned their backs
upon their home friends. And yet, so far as anything had been said,
this was a simple venture to the top of a hill to view a sunset. All
about her lay the nooks and crannies with which she had been so long
familiar. She glanced back at the house. It had receded many miles. She
was alone. That was what frightened her. The years before counted for
nothing--her old friends counted for nothing. She felt like one daring
for the first time into deep water without a supporting arm. And there
was no shore back of her. She must go forward across the golden green
waves, which sang in unreckoned miles, leagues in front of her. She
was alone. She had now only her own heart to guide her. All the tender
souls who had ever stood about her might be eager, but they could give
no answer to the questions which beset her suddenly on this simple
venture to the top of a hill. Her mother, perhaps--but in the end even
her mother must have been left behind.

Through the old garden they went, and the flowers smiled back at her.
She plucked a half-folded poppy and grasped its stem as a child clings
to a skirt. She stopped a moment to play with the others, but he said,

“Come.”

So she went on again up the winding path which she had trod no
later than yesterday. The hill loomed before her like one of those
purple-capped piles she had seen in the sunset clouds. The sun caught
her hair slantwise and brought out the gold in it.

“Are you tired?” he asked, as she lagged a little.

“No. Oh, no,” she answered breathlessly.

She hurried to his side. There was nothing else to do. The path was
blocked behind but it was wonderfully clear in front. Not so much as a
cobweb barred her progress.

Upon the hill-top they found great banners of purple and gold waving
before their eyes against a background of blue and green. Below them
the verdure of the rolling fields and maple clumps were also tinted
with gold. The air was soft, and yet it sparkled as though fine gold
were being sifted down from above. A wonderful world, and they two
stood alone in it. Populous cities subsiding their turmoil; men and
women going about the ordinary routine of their lives; ships putting to
sea and men being carried to hospitals--all those things there might be
for others outside the circumference of their eyes, but to them mere
phantasies, pleasant and unpleasant. They stood alone here and the fact
of grappling kingdoms and great deeds elsewhere were but the tawdriest
distant incidents.

Before their eyes the colors strutted the skies like vain peacocks
showing their plumage. But always, whether the dye was of crimson or
green or purple or the lightest shade of old-rose, the gold shone
through it to quicken. It was as though the theme were gold. It came as
a prelude. It ran triumphant through every movement, and in the end it
controlled the tinted postlude which softened imperceptibly into the
golden blue of the finale.

With this her thoughts grew more restful. She no longer felt afraid
though still she stood alone. He was speaking.

“Do you remember,” he asked gently, “what I told you about the true
adventurers?”

“About the little children?” she answered nodding.

“And about the lovers?” he added.

“Yes,” she was forced to admit.

He had spoken of the dangers in a way that had frightened her. Looking
down upon this same scene he had pointed them all out to her. And yet
now it was difficult to grasp them.

“When two go adventuring hand in hand the dangers are halved,” he said.

It was as though he had answered her unspoken thought.

“Then,” he added, “they are halved again and then halved once more
until they are all gone.”

Her eyes had grown distant. Her breath was coming in little gasps. The
true explanation of these last weeks came in upon her now. Twice she
had seen in a man’s eyes the dumb pain of an unuttered tragedy, but now
she remembered only the first time,--when the one man had left her to
go back to New York. In sudden fear she turned to see if any trace of
the pain were still there. She found herself looking into blue eyes
which were as quick with fine gold as the sky itself. They made her
dizzy. She tottered. Then she felt herself in the grasp of strong arms.

“Into the West,” he murmured, “straight into the West, my own.”

Her head dropped to his shoulder. She was trembling, and once again he
heard the plaintive little sound he had heard by the letter-box. In
amazement he tried to lift her head, but with a sob she only burrowed
it deeper. So he kissed her hair and patted her very gently and waited.

Whether it was one minute later or one year later that Barnes heard her
voice he could not have told. He was way off beyond the horizon line
when he caught her broken statement.

“I sha’n’t lift my head until--until it’s dark.”

The statement did not seem to disturb him. He kissed her hair.

“I’m very stupid,” she gasped.

He kissed her hair again.

“And very weak,” she murmured.

He kissed her hair once more.

“And--and altogether unworthy of you.”

Whereupon he took her head in his hands and held it back. Her eyes were
tight closed.

“Eleanor,” he called.

“No! No! No!” she pleaded.

He brought his lips to hers. For a second she allowed it so. Then she
opened her eyes wide--very, very wide.

“Dear you,” he breathed. “We have started on the Great Adventure.”

Then, for the first time, she saw a man’s face glorified.

“Come,” he said, “we must go back to Aunt Philomela.”

Her heart fell and all the way down the hill she clung to his arm.
Every now and then he stopped and looked deep into her eyes. He made
her very uncomfortable; deliriously uncomfortable.

Aunt Philomela was waiting for them in the sitting-room. When they
entered she glanced up as sharply as she had the day Barnes had first
made his entrance. The girl drew back and waited for Barnes to speak.
He said nothing. She was sure her face was red and that her hair was in
disorder.

“Well?” demanded Aunt Philomela.

With a quick little run the girl threw herself on her knees by her
aunt’s side and buried her face in her lap. Barnes waited. Aunt
Philomela’s black eyes grew dangerous.

“Well?” she demanded again.

“Oh, Aunty,” cried the girl, “can’t--can’t you see?”

For a moment Aunt Philomela stared at Barnes. Then she stooped and
kissed the girl’s head.

“Yes,” she answered slowly, “I see. I saw long ago.”

CHAPTER I


Where the narrow, rocky road from Big Laurel Cove taps the main highway
down the valley, a limpid trout stream refuses to give up its right
of way and forces a ford. Here, one afternoon in June, Bud Childers
coming down from his shack on Green Mountain stopped to water his horse
in the middle of the brook. Lank and lean, he sat easily astride the
mare, gazing about indifferently in spite of his twenty-two years. In
his inscrutable eyes there lurked something of that unchanging limpid
blue which coats these North Carolina mountains. It was not easy to
read in them anything except perhaps cruelty; an expression to which
the long line of his thin jaw closing on bloodless lips, the high
protruding cheek-bones clearly traced by his tautly drawn bronzed skin,
doubtless contributed. The hot sun beating down upon his head caused
him to raise his black dust-stained hat. A white crescent-shaped scar
was then revealed slightly above his left ear clearly visible in his
blue-black hair--souvenir of the day that the Enfield boys, stimulated
by liquor, attempted, in an argument, to knife him. The Enfields have
their souvenir in a marble slab in Mount Bethel churchyard. The memory
of this episode was never so completely out of Bud’s mind but that the
unexpected crackle of a twig sent his hand flashing back to the gun
always within reach. It did at this moment as his quick ear caught the
sound of movement in the cover of hemlocks and rhododendrons skirting
the road at the bend beyond him. His face remained immobile. His eyes
were leveled like a rifle barrel. His bony hand was alert. And all for
a slight, flaxen-haired girl carrying under her arm a small sack of
flour!

She stepped out upon the road, and for a moment the sun claimed her for
its own, drenching her through and through with its luminous rays like
a spot-light from a distant gallery on the figure of a woodland nymph.
It touched with gold the girl’s white-clad figure, her silken hair, her
wonderfully fair skin, and lighted her eager, young face--a primitive
face, but with the beauty of a wild rose half opened. She might have
been eighteen or a little less. Much of the child was still left, but
the mouth had already begun to harden and the eyes to question. At this
moment, however, both eyes and mouth were gently smiling, moved into
unconscious harmony with the picture before her--the slope pied with
mountain daisies half asleep under the soft radiance of the setting
sun; the sanded road burnished to a golden sheen, and finally the
stream in front where the scattered shafts of light spent themselves in
flashing from stone to stone. It was a setting worthy of the princes of
the fairy books she had lately been reading--reading as children read.

Bud, still motionless, saw her--but not wholly as a prince might have
seen her. His eyes noted scarcely more than her pretty figure suggested
by the curve of her neck, the litheness of her movements and the trim
ankles. Her appeal to him was the primitive appeal of a woman to man.
And yet she was not just any woman, even though she was not the first
upon whom he had looked greedily. He was conscious of that at once.
She was prettier than most for one thing. And something more besides,
although he did not attempt to analyze his emotions. He was more
interested in speaking to her. In response to a tugging at his bridle,
the horse moved lingeringly out of the stream into the road. Then the
girl, startled, wide-eyed, looked up. For a second she seemed about to
turn and run. Then, as though thinking better of that, she faced the
man. The latter grinned; partly to assure her of his good nature and
partly because the sight of any one suddenly surprised was amusing.

“Afeard?” he asked.

She raised her head still higher. She recognized the man now. From all
she had heard about him she was entitled to be afraid. But the woods
were near and she could run in them like a deer.

“No,” she answered quietly.

“I ’lowed mebbe you’d heard tales about me.”

She remained uncompromisingly silent.

“My name’s Bud Childers,” he announced.

She made no reply, but shifted the sack forward on her arm as though
about to go on.

“What’s yourn?” he demanded.

“Roxie Kester.”

He sidled his horse nearer.

“Let me have that air sack. I’m goin’ your way, I reckon.”

“It ain’t heavy,” she replied, shrinking out of reach.

“Might as well,” he insisted with his wrinkled, calloused hands
outstretched; “me on a horse and you on your feet.”

“It ain’t heavy.”

“Might as well--me a man and you a woman.”

“I kin carry it all right.”

He dropped his hands to his side again, still smiling, but with the
grin of a collie dog ready to change in a flash to a snarl.

“It ain’t--isn’t fur to where I live,” she added in a sincere dislike
at hurting him--or any man.

“You been goin’ to this air school, aincher?” he asked, quick to detect
her avoidance of the “ain’t.”

“I been goin’,” she nodded.

“Like it?”

“More ’n anything I ever done,” she answered.

“How long yer been goin’?”

“Six years. Ma was sick last year, but she’s better now an’ I’m goin’
back next fall.”

“Six year o’ schoolin’ sounds like enough ter me. I ain’t been but two,
an’ that’s all I need. Got me a house over in Big Laurel Cove, got me a
cow, and I’m makin’ money too.”

The sack in her arms was becoming heavy. She was listening because she
saw no alternative, but her face remained blank. Bud noted it with a
frown.

“Got me a house,” he repeated with slightly more emphasis, “and a cow
that give a gallon and a half at a milkin’, a good sure-footed hoss
and--besides, I’m makin’ money.”

“Looks like you oughta be married with all what you say you got,” she
answered mockingly.

“Mebbe I will some o’ these days,” he answered, seeking her eyes. But
he found them at that moment turned towards a bird in the hemlocks.

Bud shifted his position in the saddle slightly and adjusted one side
of his lavender suspenders.

“Ain’t no girl in that thar Cove purty like you,” he declared.

“My pa ’lowed I was pretty,” she answered without embarrassment.

“Yo’ pa dead?”

“Three year come this September.”

“Who makes yo’ livin’ fer yer if yo’ pa’s dead?”

“My mother hires out for washing and I work out. Guess I’ll take the
path fer a piece.”

The path mounted several feet to an embankment left by the
road-builders in grading the course of the road. The roadbed
itself, hidden from the sunlight by the dense foliage of the great
chestnut-oaks cloaking the mountain-side, was rarely free of mud so
that those on foot deserted it here for the path. She started at once
and he followed below, losing sight of her at times as she was hidden
by the laurel, but falling in with her again where the path rejoined
the road. All this while he continued his conversation as he was able.

“A gal like you can’t do no good workin’ out,” he suggested.

“Ma thinks I do tol’able well.”

“Workin’ out ain’t like havin’ a home fer yo’ own.”

“I like workin’ down to Mr. Howe’s. He’s good to me and so’s Miss
Wilmer.”

“It ain’t like havin’ a home fer yo’ own.”

“They have books to read down there.”

“Where do the Howes live, anyhow?”

“The bark-covered house with the porch runnin’ round it--this side of
Valley Elk,” she informed him.

“I pass thet way sometimes. Mebbe I’ll be seein’ you off an’ on.”

“Mebbe,” she answered with a little pucker of her mouth.

“Where’s yo’ house?”

“Up there.”

She pointed to a primitive, clapboarded structure they were approaching
on the mountain-side.

He turned his eyes back to her.

“Oughta make a trip over in the Cove and see mine,” he ventured.

“Seein’ yours wouldn’t do me no good,” she returned, a bit more tartly
now that she was in sight of home. “Good-evenin’.”

With that she began to mount the path. It followed a circuitous course
through the giant rhododendrons growing on the hillside beneath
the house. In June when they were in flower she looked down on an
undulating sea of pink.

She entered the house and closed the door sharply behind her.

Bud Childers remained in the road until he heard that decisive slam
and then turned and resumed his interrupted journey. It was not often
that he went out of his way for valley folk; the round-faced folk
with laughter in their eyes. It was more often they who changed their
course for him. When he met them, it was he who kept the middle of
the road. The life that made him lean had also given him muscles with
the resiliency of highly tempered steel. The valley boys with whom he
attended the Mission school for two terms had discovered this.

At eleven, having learned to write his name Bud had gone back to the
Cove; back to the house his grandfather had built as soon after the
Civil War as the Confederate deserter hunters ceased to hunt him
through the mountains. And here, joining his father, Bud had his own
patch of corn, a newly cleared strip of mountain-side punctuated with
half-burnt stumps and decaying chestnut-oaks, showing still the cut,
a ring chopped around their bases, that had wounded them mortally and
left them there to die. At fifteen he was logging, following the logs
down into the valley to the sawmill and then making his way back to
the Cove. A living was all he claimed of life, and this he could make
without wandering far afield.

His father’s death left him alone with his grandmother--his mother had
given her life to bring him into the world--and this arrangement proved
satisfactory enough. The old lady was not good for much except to cook,
but she did that until two days before her death. When not at the stove
she rocked back and forth mechanically in the doorway, a birch brush
stained with snuff protruding from her withered lips. When she walked,
her legs followed her uncertainly, barely moving the folds of the dirty
gray calico which clothed her. Then one day she flickered out, leaving
Bud alone.

At first he did not mind being alone, for his farm and his cooking kept
him busy enough during the day. But the evenings were long. Even the
old grandmother crouching by the fireplace had made them shorter than
they were now. She scolded and fussed a good deal, but she was always
some one.

Bud, once or twice, had considered marrying. To get him a wife was the
normal and natural thing to do. No house, without one, could be said
to be complete. He was quite unemotional over the idea, and in the few
tentative proposals he had made among the daughters of his mountain
neighbors he was met by an equally unemotional refusal. Unemotionally
they had already made other plans, and though Bud was well enough they
saw no reason for shifting their affections. Besides, to do this would
in all probability involve considerable shooting on the part of certain
young men who would be more or less directly concerned in any such
alteration of arrangements.

Bud accepted these decisions philosophically. There was no harm in
asking even if in the end he did not receive. If the evenings seemed a
little lonelier than before after these half-hearted ventures, it was
not because any of these young ladies had left their mark, but merely
because he had now been longer alone.

Bud moved slowly back over the road he had just followed with Roxie
Kester and at the ford where he had met her, stopped where he had
stopped before. The setting had not changed except that the slowly
sinking sun was now casting a mellow glow over tree and stream and road
instead of the more brilliant sheen of the direct rays.

There at the bend stood the same thick cluster of rhododendrons through
which she had pushed. For a moment he waited as though he expected them
to open again and reveal once more that slight figure. He found his
blood running faster because of this. Then, half ashamed of his mood,
he started on with a muttered curse at his foolishness.




CHAPTER II


When Captain Edward Allston, A.E.F., received his discharge from the
army, he returned to his home in Baltimore to put up, as graciously as
possible, with the fuss about his safe return which he knew he must
inevitably face sooner or later. He played his part like a gentleman.
For a week he allowed his family to do with him what they wished and
accepted with a smile every attention they and his many friends,
including even the sub-debs, showered upon him. Within decent limits he
even permitted them to make a hero of him, although this, by all odds,
was the most disagreeable demand made upon him. He felt that those who
had been deprived of the chance of serving directly were entitled to
some compensation, and if they enjoyed this sort of thing, this was the
sort of thing he should allow them to enjoy.

All this while he was looking forward. He was not consciously tired,
but he was confused. His mind was in a jumble; filled with detached
pictures of training camps, and troop trains, and foul-smelling
transports, of strange faces and sights and smells and sensations,
with the tyranny of military discipline binding together the titanic
whole like the steel bands shrunk around artillery shells. If he talked
reluctantly to the eager young women who asked so many questions, it
was because he was not yet quite clear in his own mind. That was it; he
was not quite clear. And he wished to get clear.

The place to accomplish this was not within the four walls of a house,
pleasant as the house might be. He needed more room, more silence, more
time. He needed the open road, the open sky, and above all an open mind
if ever he hoped to get back to straight, normal thinking--the kind of
thinking which had characterized the Allstons since Phillip Allston
built that fine old Georgian mansion on the banks of the James in 1720
and established the family in America. Ned Allston had always resented
the circumstances which forced his grandfather to leave Virginia and
those spacious grounds for town life in Baltimore.

Allston remained at home a week. Then he packed his suitcase, tossed it
into his low gray roadster, waved au revoir to the somewhat anxious
group who did not quite understand, and started south. He had no fixed
plan. He intended to follow the better roads into Virginia and possibly
through Virginia into North Carolina, stopping where it was pleasant to
stop, fishing here and there, sleeping and eating a great deal, trying
all the time to get his thoughts to run straight so that the world
might again appear orderly to him.

The scheme worked out even better than he expected. He found it a
little hotter than was comfortable, to be sure, but he remedied that by
turning west by north and making for the Blue Ridge country. It was all
one to him which way he traveled as long as he retained the privilege
of traveling in any direction he wished. That seemed to be the one big
clarifying idea he worked out on the first lap of his journey. He was
now free to free himself and he must guard that freedom. For two years
he had been nothing but a pawn moved about by a hand over which he had
no control. He had been ordered to go to this place and, snapping his
hand to his forehead, level with his eyes, he had gone; he had been
ordered to go to that place and, saluting again, he had gone. He had
been commanded to do this and he had obeyed; he had been commanded to
do that and he had obeyed. And each time he put into the task assigned
to him everything that was in him. He stinted of himself nothing.
Furthermore, he did this gladly. The cause was worthy of his best.

But this did not mean that he accepted his lot without a struggle.
The only discipline the present generation of Allstons knew was
self-imposed. It is doubtful if one of them had ever received a direct
order until Private Allston enlisted at Plattsburg. In the following
few months the latter received enough to make up for a couple of
generations--blunt, bullying orders that roused the fighting blood
in him, until his intelligence came to his rescue. That was but the
beginning. Doubtless this was good for him; certainly it was necessary.
But now--well, it was good to be free. And if he had ceased to plot
murder against certain superior officers, he was glad they were no
longer about.

It was good to be free. It was good to be able to take the right-hand
road or the left as one chose. Or it was good to take neither and
stop when one willed. It was good not to get up in the morning any
sooner than one wished and to go to bed at night when one did wish. It
was good to meet people without any uniform to tag them. It was good
to hear them all speak English once again--even though they did it
brutally. It was good to find some, too, who did it rather nicely. Like
the young woman at Valley Elk.

It was rather an odd and dramatic circumstance--his meeting with the
young woman at Valley Elk. He had no intention of meeting her nor she
of meeting him. Until it happened, both would have said that it was
about the most remote probability of their respective lives. Wilmer
Howe had come up here from New Orleans with her father to enjoy a
quiet, cool, and serene summer in this bungalow Mr. Howe had built
several years ago for just that purpose. Allston had not come up here
for any purpose whatsoever except to try in passing a bass stream he
had heard of in the preceding village--a whim scarcely deserving to be
dignified as a purpose.

It was mid-afternoon and he had been driving all day. Settled back in
his seat, he was not as alert as he should have been so that, when
rounding a turn he saw the frail figure of a girl in the middle of the
road, he had no alternative to avoid hitting her but to swerve sharply
to the right. The sudden jerk at the wheel snapped the steering-gear
and drove him into the bushes against a chestnut-oak. He had not been
going fast, but the impact knocked the breath out of him and the broken
glass of the windshield cut his face. He pulled himself free, rather a
sorry spectacle, but able to stand, and started towards the young woman
in the road with the rather hazy intention of stopping her screams.

“Look here,” he protested feebly and brokenly because it was not easy
to talk. “Don’t make that noise. I’m the one to holler.”

Roxie covered her eyes with her hands to shut out the sight of his
blood-stained face.

“Oh,” she moaned, “yer’re killed.”

“I’m not,” he insisted. “But if you keep making that noise I’ll wish I
had been.”

Miss Wilmer came running down the serpentine drive preceded by a
barking collie dog to add to the confusion. At sight of Allston she too
was inclined to cover her eyes--brown eyes, large and limpid, and, at
the moment, big-pupiled--but she conquered her timidity. The collie dog
bared his teeth.

“Tam,” she called to him. “Tam! Down!”

Allston straightened to attention and removed his cap. His eyes were no
longer on Roxie.

“I’m sorry I stirred up all this fuss,” he apologized. “I--I think
something must have happened to the steering-gear.”

She may have been interested in the fate of the steering-gear, but she
did not show it. Her concern seemed to be wholly about him.

“You’re hurt!” she exclaimed.

Roxie, still moaning, had sidled close to Miss Howe.

“Oh, it’s all my fault, Miss Wilmer,” she choked. “An’ if you’ll let
me, I’ll run for the doctor--fast.”

The prospect of action seemed to inspire Roxie. She stood poised for
flight--her frail body quivering.

“It’s good of you both,” broke in Allston. “But, honest, I seem whole.
If you could direct me to the village--”

“I hope you don’t think me as inhospitable as that,” Miss Wilmer said
hurriedly. “Our house is just up the hill. Shall I call father to help
you?”

He tried his legs again and they seemed to be working.

“You’re very kind,” he answered, meeting her brown eyes. “I can make it
easily. My name is Allston.”

She inclined her head ever so slightly in recognition of his
introduction and bade Roxie hurry on. The latter on the instant flew up
the road, running free as a wild thing.

Allston found himself making his way by the side of Wilmer Howe towards
a grassy terrace before a low-roofed bungalow set upon the summit of
the incline. Obviously this was a summer home, designed without much
originality, but with good taste and ample means; a house, he thought
at once, expressing the father rather than the daughter. He would
expect something more distinctive of her. Perhaps it was she who was
responsible for the grounds--generous and well-cared-for, bounded by
a hedge of balsams giving a trace of formality to the enclosure. And
yet, when halfway up he paused for breath--his ribs had received a bad
bruising--and looked below over the luxuriant meadows in the valley and
the symmetrical fields beneath the radiant sun, he thought she must be
responsible for all that too.

A lean, erect man with white hair stepped through the door of the house
to the porch, looking very much disturbed. At sight of Allston he
hurried forward, walking briskly and firmly.

“What’s this Roxie tells me? An accident?”

His brown eyes swept Allston’s face and figure and instantly grew
sympathetic.

“I hope it’s not serious?”

“Not at all, sir,” answered Allston. “My face--”

“His car swerved and struck a tree,” explained the daughter.

“That’s bad. The road there is dangerous. Come right into the house.”

He placed a broad hand beneath Allston’s arm.

“The first thing to do is to clean those cuts,” he advised.

“I imagine it’s the only thing to do,” laughed Allston. “The car came
off worse than I.”

“Fortunately. Cars are more easily replaced than heads,” answered Howe.
“Wilmer will telephone for the doctor if you think it necessary.”

“I’m sure it isn’t. All I need is a chance to wash up.”

Howe escorted him to the guest-room, pretty in yellow and old rose
chintz, and pointed out the very modern and immaculate bath opening
from it.

“You need my help?” he asked.

“Thanks, but I can manage nicely.”

“Then I will wait for you on the porch.”

The cuts, while not ornamental, were not serious. Cold water both
cleaned them and stopped their bleeding. His ribs were still sore, but
that injury did not show. He rejoined his host within twenty minutes
very much improved in appearance if by no means restored to his
original condition of a half-hour before.

Allston’s intention was to express his thanks and make his way afoot
to the village at once. He had already intruded long enough on the
generous hospitality of these good people. But his polite plan was more
easily conceived than executed. It seems that neither Mr. Howe nor his
daughter was yet ready to believe--having brought up his bag in the
interim and inspected the machine--that Allston was in any condition to
proceed. When he came down he found they had arranged for him a large,
comfortable wicker chair before a dainty tea-table laden with cool
drinks and cakes and preserves.

“My dear sir!” exclaimed Mr. Howe solicitously. “I could not think of
allowing you to go, and besides--where would you go?”

“I was hoping to find, if not a hotel, then some kind of
boarding-place.”

“There is no hotel, and the boarding-houses are already full.”

“That _is_ a complication,” frowned Allston. Then, brightening, “But
there is still the car. I can sleep on the seat if you don’t mind my
using a portion of your blue sky for a roof.”

“With a spare room in my house, sir?”

Allston laughed. He laughed pleasantly, revealing fine white teeth. It
was a better voucher than most formal introductions.

“I am indebted to you, sir,” he answered, unconsciously imitating the
touch of formality which characterized the speech of Mr. Howe. “I am
indebted to you--and the chestnut-oak.”

But his indebtedness did not end there. Properly he should have
included Roxie who entered at that moment bearing a tray. It was she
who had first swerved him from the main road. He found her blue
eyes upon him--eyes filled with shy anxiety. He smiled into them
good-naturedly.

“All through crying?” he asked.

“Yes, sir,” she answered, confused.

“That’s good because it wasn’t your fault at all.”

“It was,” she insisted with a directness and positiveness that startled
him.

“Roxie,” warned Wilmer. “It isn’t polite to contradict.”

“It ain’t perlite to lie, is it?” retorted Roxie with no trace of
insolence, but with frank conviction.

“You may go now.”

As the girl went out, Wilmer evidently felt called upon to explain her.

“She’s a treasure and I don’t know what we’d do without her. We can’t
bring colored servants with us from home. There isn’t society enough
here for them. But I’m afraid the Mission school hasn’t been able to
change her temperament, although it has improved her English. Somehow
you don’t mind her frankness much when you get used to her.”

“I don’t mind even now,” returned Allston. “She’s honest, at any rate.”

“She’s honest and she’s good,” nodded Wilmer, serving him with cold
tea. “And a firm believer in fairies.”

“Is that to her advantage or not?” questioned Allston.

She hesitated. Allston was on the whole surprised at that. He himself
might have hesitated if asked to consider the question seriously,
but he did not expect it of her. And he was more or less puzzled and
interested by her answer.

“If she’d only believe in bad fairies too,” she said.

“Nonsense,” broke in the father. “That’s a paradox. All fairies are
good. As soon as they aren’t, they are something else.”

“Father is as gallant to the fairies as to the ladies,” she smiled with
evident fond appreciation of that quality.

“Wilmer is worried about a young mountaineer who has lately been paying
his attentions to Roxie,” broke in Howe, throwing some light on the
argument. “He hasn’t a very good reputation, it’s true. But I tell her
that a man can’t throw a woman over his saddle like in the old days and
make off with the lady against her will.”

“Which might be true,” put in Wilmer. “Except that some of these
mountain folk are still living in the old days. Bud Childers is hardly
more than a cave man.”

“And he’s your bad fairy?” asked Allston.

“Or the something else,” she smiled. “Fairy, good or bad, is rather a
light name for a six-foot man.”

Perhaps she felt the conversation had swung into too personal a
channel, for deftly she turned it aside to the more general discussion
of the effect of Mission schools upon these people. She had rather
positive views.

Allston listened politely, but not so much to what she said as to
the melody of her voice and to the quick play of expression on her
fine face, particularly about the mouth. She had a mouth such as is
generations in the making--two sensitive lips, full without being too
full, thin without being too thin, balanced nicely, almost exquisitely,
above a firm, if rounded chin. Her straight nose matched the chin
rather than the mouth. It came from her father rather than her mother,
he thought. The eyes were a girl’s eyes grown, by much reading, a bit
mature before her time. She controlled them a little too well for
youth, perhaps, and yet at moments Allston caught in them flashes as
wayward as sunbeams.

Then, somehow, Allston found the conversation back in the personal
channel--this time sweeping his own life into the current. He felt a
certain obligation here. So as briefly as possible he filled in enough
of his past to give them some slight understanding of who he was and
why he was here. He found them both eager listeners and when he had
done, the dusk was well upon them. Howe rose and extended his hand as
though to welcome a new guest.

“I feel honored more than ever,” he said a little pompously but
sincerely, “to entertain a man who fought for democracy.”




CHAPTER III


Bud Childers sat before the open fire in his log shack on Big Laurel
Cove. He sat alone. It is not good for a man to be alone unless he is
either poet or philosopher. Bud was neither. And yet, on the board
table which, with a few rough chairs, was the only article in the way
of furniture the room contained, stood a bottle and in the bottle a
withered branch from a laurel bush, plucked just beyond the ford where
he had first seen Roxie Kester. It would have been foolhardy of any one
to accuse Bud of expressing here a poetic idea. The chances are that he
would have accepted this as a challenge. He knew nothing about poets or
poetry or poetic ideas, he was not that kind. Maybe a squirrel brought
in the branch, and if any one cared to dispute that statement Bud was
ready.

But no one did dispute it. He was alone. Being alone will play strange
tricks with a man--with any man. It will bring to light, like digging
in the ground, many curious things, both good and bad.

Two weeks had passed since Bud first met Roxie--a disappointing two
weeks. Four times within that period he had waylaid her on the road
before the Howe house and walked by her side as far as her home. He had
spoken her fair and spoken her foul--losing his temper once and making
a threat. Maddened by her stubbornness he had rested a heavy hand upon
her arm.

“Y’are comin’,” he had said. “Y’are comin’ if I hev to carry yuh.”

And she, pulling herself free, had clenched her two little fists.

“If we had us men-folks home, you’d be slow sayin’ that, Bud Childers.”

Which was not altogether true. Men-folk or no men-folk, he meant to
have her. He meant to have her because he wanted her more than he had
ever wanted anything in his life. There was something peculiar about
this. He had desired things before, but never like this. If what he
wished came easily, he took it; if not, he forgot. As long as he had
a roof over his head, a plot of land of his own, enough to eat, and a
little money, he could always worry along. Mostly he lived each day
as it came, content enough in his mountain kingdom. Even when he
first began to feel the loneliness of the nights and to look about for
a wife, it was with indifferent interest in the woman herself. His
interest in Roxie was, perhaps, even at the start, quicker than that
he had ever felt for others of her sex, but he had not anticipated any
such desire as that which had now taken possession of him.

He had wanted her first because she was a woman and he a man. Then
he had wanted her because she was good to look upon; dainty and
clean-limbed and shy as a fawn. Finally he wanted her because she was
Roxie Kester; because she was herself. Just what this meant he did not
know, except that now, to-day, he felt she was the one woman who could
ever break his loneliness; this new loneliness which she herself had
created.

It is one thing to be lonely; another to be alone. Without her, he
was alone. This did not mean merely that he was by himself. That is
a negative condition. It meant an acute consciousness of the absence
of another. That is positive. It left him not content to wait, and
impelled him to action.

Bud was like a child in his impatience over delay. Patience is not
an inborn virtue; it is the product of high development. It involves
self-control which is the ultimate goal of civilization. Like a child,
too, Bud felt a desire to be equivalent to a proprietary right. Wanting
Roxie, he was entitled to her.

And so, sitting alone before his fire rolling and smoking innumerable
cigarettes, Bud planned how he might get her. To him it seemed only a
matter of gaining possession. The future would look after the rest.
He was sure of himself there. She was stubborn and as full of fight
as a mountain wildcat, but she would tame. He even smiled a little in
anticipation of that struggle. She would tame. He had broken horses and
he had broken men. His thin lips hardened. He could also break a woman.

Break her, yes, but after that, he could break any one else who tried
to harm her. Once she was his own, then valley folk or mountain folk
had better have a care how they trespassed. He would relish the
opportunity to prove himself. He would relish it at this moment. God,
if only he could get out and shoot for her! If only it were as simple
as that!

But it was not some one else he must fight now; it was the girl
herself. She had heard stories about him. That was the trouble. Well,
some of them were true enough, but they had nothing to do with the
present. What was past was past. He had done nothing but defend his
rights. Once she was his, he would defend her rights too.

The thing to do first was to get her. There was just one way to
accomplish this if she wouldn’t come; that was to bring her. He could
not carry her before a minister against her will, but he could fetch
her up here. He could keep her here one night and then--she would go to
the minister quickly enough after that.

Bud’s breath came faster as he planned. His face hardened around the
mouth, but it grew mellow about the eyes. To have her here--to have
her here! It was something to grow breathless about just to picture
her--say in that chair over yonder. She might tear at him with her
little fingers; she might cry, but even so she would be here. She would
be part of this room; part of his life. He would no longer be alone.

Then, lifting his hectic eyes, Bud caught sight of the sprig of laurel
in the bottle on the table. It was like a bit of her--like her in a
tender mood, a pleading mood. He rose and paced the room, his gaunt
shadow following him silently. He didn’t want to hurt her. He didn’t
mean for to hurt her. He was going to marry her all right and proper,
and she’d be glad as soon as she got used to him. He’d give her
everything she wanted; plenty of new dresses and money and candy. He’d
go down to the village with her and let her buy all the new furniture
she wanted. He’d let her keep the house clean and he would wipe the mud
off’n his feet when he came in. He’d aim to please her every way she
wanted. In a little while she’d get used to him.

So Bud planned, and the sooner his plans were carried out the better.
There wasn’t any sense in keeping her riled up or in keeping himself
riled up. To-morrow night was as good as any. No sense in keeping riled
up.




CHAPTER IV


It was little Tom Culley, weasel-faced and dirty, who, for a pint of
moonshine whiskey offered by Bud, took to Roxie at the Howe bungalow
one night the lying message that her mother was sick and the summons to
come home at once. For the previous three days Bud had waited from dusk
until dark only to be forced back over the trail to Big Laurel Cove
disappointed and alone. The girl had not come out.

Roxie herself might have found difficulty in explaining why she kept so
tight within doors, for it was not wholly on account of Bud Childers.
True enough the man had been pestering her; had followed her home
against her will and made his threats. And yet when quite honest with
herself she knew she was not afraid of him. He might pinch her arm with
his big hand, and he might scowl, and he might say he was going to do
this and do that, but in the end what could he do? Once she had cowed
him with a smile, and once again she had said to him in a voice hardly
above a whisper:

“Bud Childers--stop.”

And he had stopped.

It had given her a new sense of power.

He was more a nuisance than anything else--a nuisance at a time when
she wanted to be left alone with her thoughts. If Bud had been able
to read these, he would have waited even more restlessly than he did,
down there by the ford. There were others, too, who might have grown
restless.

But the thoughts of a young woman, until she chooses to voice them,
are her own. They are her sacred city. Bold adventurers or the merely
curious may try to enter through the eyes and guess what lies behind,
but it is more than probable they will guess wrong. At any rate, they
can never know with certainty if only the lady keeps her lips sealed.

And that, Roxie--cross her throat and hope to die--meant to do. It was
her one excuse for not at the very beginning running from her dreams
like a startled fawn. She could not be blamed for getting them--they
came from around a corner as suddenly as Allston’s machine had that
day; but she could be blamed for keeping them. Way down deep in her
romantic little heart--where half of what she knew came from--she
understood her danger. It was one thing to have a fairy prince safe
within the covers of a story-book, where he could be shut in again at
the end of the day, and quite another to have him walking around the
house in flesh and blood, sometimes within arm’s length, where closing
a door upon him did no good whatever. Because often enough she could
still hear his voice as he talked to Miss Wilmer or at least hear his
footsteps as he strode about his room.

Allston had risked his life to save her life. That was the beginning of
her dream. He had done a fine thing, as a prince might do it--head up,
a smile on his lips, and quietly. He had staked his life for hers--even
when she was at fault. And this gave a new value to her life. It gave a
new dignity. One moment she was nothing much to any one; the next, more
than a king’s ransom--a king’s son--had been offered for her.

If, after this, he had vanished, it would still have been safe for
Roxie to dream on. Princes are harmless enough until they begin to
stalk around in the daytime. Then they become dangerous--however well
meaning.

Allston stayed on. This was at the suggestion of Howe. Certain parts of
the wrecked car had to be sent away for and this took time. Besides,
there was no especial reason why he should not remain, anyway--as far
as he or any one else could see at the time. Both father and daughter
proved congenial to him and he, apparently, proved congenial to them.
He had driven far enough to get a certain amount of restlessness out of
his system and the idea of basking for a while beneath this golden sun
rather appealed.

So Roxie cooked his breakfast and served it to him; so, too, she
did his lunch; so, too, his dinner. She cared for his room--humbly,
gratefully, almost religiously. She made his bed and smoothed out his
pillows with her eyes aglow. She picked up all his things--he was none
too tidy--and placed them where they belonged. She even polished his
shoes. He caught her at it once. She was using his kit when by chance
he came back into his room after some forgotten thing. She did not know
he was there until she felt his hand on her shoulder.

“Roxie,” he said quietly, “I’ll do that myself.”

Startled, she faced him.

“It’s a man’s job,” he explained.

“But I don’t mind--honest I don’t.”

“But I mind,” he returned.

She dropped the brushes obediently and he went out. Allston had never
been able to accustom himself in France to the sight of women burdened
with the tasks of men.

Roxie gathered brown-eyed Susans and placed them in his room--secretly.
And happily. And when he came downstairs with one of the posies in his
buttonhole, she felt like singing. He did not know she had picked them,
but that made no difference to her. She was asking no reward for her
service other than he had already given; other than he was giving her
every day he remained.

Allston, for his part, spoke her fair always; without either
condescension or boldness. She was white; she was young; she was
native. She was, he felt, in every way entitled to his respect. Even
to the Howes she was more like one of the family than a servant. To
Allston she possessed the added interest of a whimsical personality new
to him so that he never missed an opportunity of speaking to her.

“I suppose these folk are more nearly native American than most,” he
once suggested to Wilmer.

“The American of eighteen-fifty,” she answered.

Hesitatingly one day Allston took from his wallet a dollar bill,
prompted solely by the desire to recompense her for the extra work he
felt he had occasioned.

“This is for you,” he explained.

“What fer?” she demanded.

“For ribbons or anything you need. I’ve been a lot of bother.”

“You ain’t bothered me none.”

“But--”

“You ain’t bothered me none.”

“I’ve made you more work.”

Her face colored as it always did in spite of herself when she tried to
talk to him.

“I don’t call that bother,” she replied.

“Well,” he laughed. “Then all I can do is to thank you again.”

“That’s--enough,” she said.

As it turned out, however, Allston did find an opportunity to do a
little more. When Roxie came to Wilmer with that message from Tom
Culley reporting her mother’s sickness, it was already dark. Even so,
had it not been for the recent advances of Bud Childers to Roxie,
Wilmer would have considered the walk safe enough for the girl. As it
was she was a bit worried. Voicing her fears to her father, Allston
overheard.

“I’ll go along with her,” he suggested on the instant.

Howe demurred a moment.

“I don’t suppose there’s any danger, but those mountain folk are a
queer lot.”

“What do you mean?”

“If Childers should be along the way--”

He paused a moment, and then added:

“He’s pretty free with a gun.”

“That’s simple,” answered Allston. “I’ll carry one myself.”

“I don’t imagine you’ll need it, but it might be as well to have it.”

So Allston thrust his automatic in his pocket and immediately forgot
it. He joined Roxie and she led the way from the open valley to the
winding, rocky road which ran along the thickly wooded mountain-side.
The hush of the early night was here. The great symphony of the
forest’s nocturnal players had not yet begun their overture, awaiting
the last bar of the catbird’s vesper song. High above the trees a full
moon furnished a silver light where it could get through.

Roxie was as sure-footed as he, but instinctively he steadied her with
his hand. She was, if anything, less steady after that than before. It
was as though she became a little dizzy.

“Am I going too fast for you?” he asked.

“No, sir.”

Yet twice she stumbled and would have fallen had he not caught her.

“Careful there,” he warned. “It’s a rough old road.”

So they came to the bend. Rounding it, the girl was the first to see
the dim figure of a man on horseback a few paces before them. Against
the impenetrable background of foliage, the sharply drawn contour of
the rider’s face stood out like the countenance of a monk from a black
cowl.

It was Bud. She could see him only dimly, but she knew his eyes had
left her to question the man by her side. And she caught the slow,
stealthy movement of his hand creeping back to his hip.




CHAPTER V


Allston, at first, was not inclined to take the situation seriously.
The scene, like an act of melodrama, was not sufficiently motivated to
convince him. Here was a dark, scowling figure of a man on horseback
planted squarely in the middle of the moonlit road--a villain made to
order. Clinging to his arm, Allston felt the tight grip of Roxie’s warm
fingers--the heroine if one wished so to consider her. And he--well, it
looked as though he were cast for the part of hero. But he did not know
his lines.

Had this been France and a year ago, he would have been quick enough to
react to the danger. The world was at war then and he was tuned up to
it. Often enough on night patrol he had walked straight into the heart
of even grimmer drama than this and played his rôle like a veteran,
with life the penalty of a miscue.

But he had left all that behind him. The world was now at peace. It
was surprising how quickly he had been able to forget that trees meant
possible ambush and that moonlight in open spaces was a source of
deadly danger. Men no longer were enemies and beautiful young women no
longer needed rescuers. Civilization had reasserted her rights and bade
men walk once again relaxed and at their ease.

Even at this moment, Allston viewed the scene more as an effective
picture than anything else. Bud, lank and lean, made rather a striking
figure of the solitary horseman type. He had jerked up the mare’s
head, and she, a bit frightened by the figures in the shadows, pricked
forward her ears and snorted impatiently. In the silver light the two
were rather spooky. As they stood there, silent and immobile now, it
would not have greatly surprised Allston if it developed that the rider
had no head.

But Roxie Kester knew better. The man before her was no apparition.
He was a grim reality. And his silence did not imply passiveness. She
understood the meaning of that slight forward bend of his head and the
significance of that quietly moving arm creeping towards the gun at
his hip. And she knew better than anything else the interpretation Bud
would place upon the presence of this stranger by her side. Her wildly
beating heart--beating like a frightened bird at the approach of a
hostile hand--told her that.

Yet for a moment she also stood transfixed. She like the two men
resembled a figure cut out of black paper. It was as though the night
birds had also come to this conclusion, for softly, here and there in
the trees and bushes roundabout, they ventured forth once more into
cooing calls.

Roxie was the first to speak. She moved forward a step, and thereby,
without any realization on Allston’s part of what she was doing, placed
herself between the two men.

“Hullo, Bud,” she said.

“Hullo, Roxie,” he answered.

“I’m goin’ hum ’cause ma’s sick,” she explained.

“Yo’ ma’s sick?”

“Little Tom Culley--he sent word.”

“Needed a stranger ter show the way, I reckon?”

“He’s a frien’ o’ Miss Wilmer,” she answered almost eagerly.

“Then,” said Bud, deliberately--“then he oughter stay with Miss Wilmer.
It ain’t healthy in these hills--fer strangers.”

Bud had reached his gun. He brought it forward, at this point, rather
ostentatiously, and rested it on the pummel of his saddle.

“Bud!” cried Roxie.

But Allston, in the meanwhile, had reached his own gun. He had no
desire to force any issue here unless it proved necessary. His
instinct, however, warned him that he could no longer keep himself in
the background. His temper, moreover, had been pricked by the studied
insolence of Bud’s reference to strangers. When he acted, he acted
quickly. With his raised automatic he jumped forward.

“Throw down that gun,” he ordered.

Bud made a motion and Allston fired. He was a sure shot and he had
learned well his lesson that when any firing is to be done, it is well
to fire first. He aimed at the weapon in Bud’s hand and the gun spun
out of the lean fingers into the bushes. The mare jumped and Roxie
screamed. The birds in the woods became instantly hushed. With an oath
Bud checked his horse and turned as though to ride the two down. But
the automatic was still leveled and the brown eyes behind it quite
untroubled.

“Steady there,” warned Allston.

“You ugly, pink-cheeked hornyhead,” choked Bud, “I’ll cut yer heart out
fer that.”

“Steady,” repeated Allston.

“It ain’t healthy here fer strangers, particular when they messes in
somethin’ that don’t concern ’um.”

“But when it does concern them?” questioned Allston.

Bud turned from Allston to Roxie. She shrank closer to her protector
which exasperated Bud still more.

“Like ’um pink-cheeked and white-fingered, don’ cha,” he growled.

Allston lost the last remnant of his patience at that. He pulled the
girl to the side of the road.

“Now,” he commanded, “you move on.”

Helpless Bud turned his horse in the direction of the Kester house.

“Not that way--this,” ordered Allston pointing to his rear.

His voice was metallic. His words were as decisive as a military order.
Men from Gibraltar to Timbuktu recognize that quality.

Bud swung his horse and with an oath cantered past the two. Allston
stood facing in the same direction until assured by the receding
clatter of the hoofs merging into the forest silence that the man did
not pull up when out of sight. Then he thrust his automatic back in his
pocket.

Almost impatiently, he turned to the girl. He found her bright eyes
upraised to his. Her pretty face was flushed with excitement--and
something more. In the tender, softening light of the moon--lovers’
light--he caught an expression which brought the color to his own
cheeks. He breathed a little faster as he allowed his eyes to meet
her eyes. Her lips were tight as though she were deliberately making
them tight to imprison her tongue. Her head was a little back--a quite
unconscious pose of silent supplication. Her body was lax. Her arms
hung loosely by her side--the long, slender arms of a girl.

To Allston at the moment she seemed almost a product of the
forest, like some delicate fern bred in the wild, but possessing
an exquisiteness beyond the reach of the most skilled florists;
possessing, too, the sturdiness that Nature gives, but which the
hothouse sacrifices. Again she reminded him of some of those young
women of France at once so intensely human and so instinctively
spiritual. There were such faces, passed in the day’s grim work, which
still haunted him. So, he felt, this face before him always would haunt
him.

The moonlight--the moonlight! The silence--the silence! The hush of a
stilled world with all harsh things made beautiful by night! The girl
with eager, motionless lips, one with the growing things that bid a man
take as he finds!

Allston shook himself free from the spell, breathing deeply.

“Come,” he said, “it--it is time we went on.”

Slowly, like a drooping flower, Roxie’s head lowered. Her limp arms
stiffened. Her lips tightened even more. She fell into step by his side
as he led the way at a faster pace than before along the mountain road
leading to her home.

Where the circuitous path ended in a clearing before her house, Allston
left her.

“I guess you’re safe enough now, Roxie.”

“Yes, sir,” she answered.

“And I hope you won’t find your mother very sick. If you think there’s
anything more I can do--”

“No, sir,” she broke in hurriedly, “I reckon there ain’t--isn’t.”

“Then we’ll see you in the morning?”

“I’ve gotter git yo’ breakfast.”

“Not if your mother needs you.”

“I’ve gotter git yo’ breakfast.”

“We can manage somehow.”

“I’ve gotter cook you hot muffins. Miss Wilmer she cain’t do that.”

“Can’t she?” he smiled. “Then we must manage without them.”

“No, sir. I gotter do that.”

“Well, we’ll see. If you don’t come I’ll call here in the morning.”

She looked frightened.

“I reckon yer better not,” she decided.

“Eh?”

“Yer better not.”

“But I will,” he replied.

“Please, Mister Allston--that Bud--”

Allston shrugged his shoulders impatiently.

“I’ll let him do the worrying.”

“Only yer don’t know Bud. He don’t ferget.”

“That ought to be in my favor--if he doesn’t forget,” he suggested.
“But you don’t think for a moment he’s going to keep me off the road?”

“No,” she answered instantly. “That’s why I’m afeard fer you.”

There was almost a mother light in her eyes. Impulsively Allston took
one of her warm hands in his.

“You’re a good little girl,” he said tenderly. “But you’ve got worries
enough of your own without including me. Good-night.”

“Good-night,” she answered.

Her voice was as cooing low and sweet as that of a night bird. He
dropped her hand and started to retrace his steps. Once he turned. He
found her looking after him.

“Good-night,” he called back. “Don’t worry.”

But Roxie stood there, never moving until she could no longer hear even
the lightest trace of his footsteps. Then she lifted her eyes to the
stars. They smiled back at her. She thought they were like his eyes.
Only they were so high--so dizzily far away. They were above the house,
above the trees, above even the heights of Caterpillar Ridge, above
Green Mountain, which was the highest place she knew about. They were
almost as high as God. He lived there among them. And yet the preacher
said that He was always near--right around us everywhere. So the stars
must be nearer than they looked. So perhaps the eyes of the Prince
might be nearer than they seemed. Things could be far away and yet very
near. That was confusing. Also it was comforting. The puzzled frown
left her face as she pushed open the door and went in.

She found her mother busy about her normal tasks and showing no
evidence of illness. But the sight, instead of bringing her relief,
roused a new fear.

“Tom Culley said yuh was tuk sick,” explained Roxie, as her mother
observed her entrance with as much surprise as she ever showed about
anything. Her emotions had ceased to be more than the ghostly relics
of emotions long since dead. She had exhausted them years before.
Resignation had taken their place.

“I ain’t sick,” she answered with a slow shake of her head. “How cum
Tom Culley to say thet?”

Her pale eyes squinting from a meager, desiccated face, white as wax,
listlessly met the quick young eyes of her daughter.

The answer was clear enough to Roxie. It explained the presence of Bud
Childers in the middle of the road. The girl turned towards the door.

“I’m a-goin’ back,” she said.

“Goin’ back?”

But Roxie sprang for the latch. If Bud Childers had laid for her such a
plot as this, the incident would not end there. He would be waiting for
Allston to return. She threw open the door and ran out into the night;
straight down the rocky mountain road. And as she ran, she called his
name.

“Mister Allston! Mister Allston!”

There was no answer. Allston, far ahead, was walking fast.




CHAPTER VI


As ten o’clock came and then eleven, Wilmer found it more and more
difficult not to respond to her father’s fears.

“We shouldn’t have allowed him to go,” declared Howe.

“And yet,” answered the girl, “he’s the sort of man you feel to be
capable of going anywhere.”

“I don’t doubt his courage,” responded Howe. “But against a man of the
type of Childers he needs something more.”

“What do you mean, dad?”

“He needs to know his man. Childers has no code. If he couldn’t shoot
a man in front, he’d shoot him in the back. Such a chap has one idea
and only one--to get his man; by fair means, if convenient, by foul, if
necessary.”

“You don’t think Childers means to--to get him?”

“I don’t know anything about it. Apparently the fellow is infatuated
with Roxie. If that is so, he’ll resent any interference--particularly
on the part of a stranger. I ought to have known better than to let
him start.”

“I doubt if you could have prevented it, dad,” answered the girl.

“It was my duty--as host.”

Wilmer turned back to her book--a Galsworthy novel. That seemed to be
about as far as she could get in it to-night--just to turn back to it
again and again. The pages in which ordinarily she was able to lose
herself were just so many white pieces of paper covered with print.
They were very white and symmetrical and the print very black and
even, making so many parallel lines from side to side. But there was a
certain monotony to literature in this form. It seemed scarcely worth
while to turn the leaves.

In the two weeks Wilmer had been living in daily contact with
Allston--a more sustained contact than she had ever experienced with
any man of her own age--she had developed a very real interest in him.
Her life for the last five years, since the death of her mother, had
been largely devoted to her father. By nature quiet and reflective,
she had found this sphere adequate enough on the whole to satisfy
her, and where it did not she was able to piece it out with her
books. She read a great deal and intelligently without, however, any
especial objective. She preferred, generally speaking, books with an
analytical turn and modern rather than classic--James and Meredith,
and the younger school of British novelists with their intense if
somewhat vague passion for the super-critical and radical approach to
present-day problems. And yet the net result of their influence was
to leave her rather more conservative than before. She was willing
enough to believe these young observers, but the effect of this was to
cultivate in her a rather cynical distaste for actual contact with the
life they described--particularly on its emotional side. And so, though
her home in New Orleans still remained, through her social connections,
a gathering-place for a group of young men and women, they came and
went marking only so many pleasant inconsequential incidents of a
season. There were several young fellows who, it is true, pressed their
attentions upon her a little more eagerly than others, but her retreat
at the beginning of each summer to this mountain fastness always
discouraged them. They preferred to follow the pretty faces which led
to the gayer resorts.

And yet Wilmer Howe was not without her attractions. As far as physical
beauty goes she possessed a piquant charm of her own. She had as
pretty a face as any of those who had pretty faces and not much else.
Her brown eyes were like placid pools reflecting autumn foliage--the
deep pools one finds in shaded places. Her mouth and nose and chin
were modeled as a careful and sensitive artist might model them. If
they were not as quickly responsive as the features of some of her
friends, they perhaps inspired more confidence when they did respond.
It meant something to rouse Wilmer Howe either to laughter or tears.
Few had accomplished either, though many had made her smile and a few
claimed to have seen her eyes dimmed. A handsome good-for-nothing from
Georgia--later killed at Château-Thierry--had done more than that, but
he never spoke of it. He kept it, to the end, a grave secret.

Allston was the first man ever presented to her without a
well-filled-in background. He had done his best, since, to supply the
deficiency by casual mention of his mother and father and sister, even
a few aunts and cousins for good measure, and an incidental reference
to the ancestor who settled on the James. She never questioned
any of his statements--except her father she had never met a more
straightforward man or one whose ordinary speech she was so ready to
accept at its full face value--but these people to whom he referred
remained nothing more than shadows. They lacked all the sidelights that
mutual friends throw upon such a group.

Not that she minded particularly. In a way it was rather refreshing. It
left her free--utterly free--to discover the man for herself. Here he
was, undeniably prepossessing, straight and tall, clear of eye, thin
of face, bearing a faint resemblance physically and superficially to
the lean mountain folk hereabouts. But he and they had chosen different
roads a hundred years ago--perhaps a thousand years ago. A passing
glance told her all she needed to know of a man like Bud Childers. A
decade might never fully reveal a man like Allston.

And yet, at times, she felt as though she had made wonderful progress
in even this brief period of two weeks. She had come to like him. She
had come to trust him. She had come to wait for him. And now to-night
she had come to worry about him.

That, on the whole, was a bit absurd. She recognized as much herself.
It rather vexed her. Of course her anxiety could be justified on
general humanitarian grounds. She was not so cold-blooded but that
any man in danger roused her sympathies. And this man was her guest.
Moreover, she was indirectly responsible for having placed him in his
present hazardous position. Clearly, then, there was nothing unnatural
in the fact of her being more or less disturbed when he was two hours
late.

More or less--upon the nice balance of those two words hung the fine
distinction of whether her present agitation was normal or abnormal.
A little more in one scale, a little less in the other, makes all the
difference in the world. The trouble was that with her it was one
moment a little more and the next a little less. The scales refused to
remain stationary.

And her friend Galsworthy did not help her in the slightest. Rightfully
he should have bade her shrug her shoulders and go on with him. He
should have said, in effect:

“Be sensible. This man is not anything in particular to you, and even
if he is your guest there is nothing you can do to relieve his plight.
He is only a figure in real life and you know you are not greatly
concerned about such. They are merely shadows. Come with me and I will
show you the substance--men who are men. I will reveal to you the raw,
crude inwardness of men. You will be wiser--and safer.”

But he failed her. To be sure, she refused to listen, but the fault
still remained his. The function of the artist is to command attention.

At quarter past eleven she put down her book and moved restlessly about
the room. Covertly her father watched her. There was an expression
on her face he had never seen since she was a little girl--frank,
unrestrained fear.

“There’s a full moon and the chances are he is enjoying it,” the father
suggested.

She brushed aside the curtains and looked out. The grass was a stagy
green; the trees like the trees of Maeterlinck. The driveway leading to
the road was as clear as by daylight.

“The moon is full,” she nodded. “That makes it easy to see.”

But if it made it easy for Allston to see, it made it easy for
Childers. One had the choice of getting comfort or added fear from that.

“Of course he may have strayed from the road,” said Howe.

“It is possible, but not probable,” decided Wilmer.

“Why do you say that?”

“He has told me about his night patrols in France.”

“He had his maps and his instructions to help him there.”

“Yes,” she admitted. “That’s true.”

“Then--”

But at that moment Wilmer caught sight of a figure in the roadway. Only
the slightest quickening of the movement of her nostrils revealed the
jump her heart gave. She drew back a little so as not to be seen. Then
she waited perhaps two breaths before saying:

“Here he comes now.”

She recrossed the room to the table, resumed her seat, and picked
up her book. It was here Allston saw her when he came in. Howe had
hurried to the door.

“Welcome back,” the latter greeted the younger man heartily. “You gave
us all a scare.”

“I’m sorry. The night was so wonderful I took my time.”

Wilmer looked up from her book with a smile. His presence was enough to
throw her back into her usual calm. Her fears of a moment ago honestly
now appeared ludicrous.

“You didn’t meet with any adventures, then?”

“But I did,” Allston smiled back. “I was the hero of a real bit of
melodrama.”

He sat down crossing his long legs comfortably.

Howe appeared concerned.

“You didn’t meet Childers?”

“In full force,” admitted Allston.

Then lightly and entertainingly he told the whole story. And yet not
the whole story. As he talked, somehow Roxie did not stand out as
prominently in his narrative as actually she did in the picture the
episode had left in his own mind. Rather deliberately he was slightly
reticent about some details--insignificant enough in themselves--which
had registered with unusual vividness in his own mind. He did this
partly as a matter of personal taste and partly out of respectful
deference to Roxie herself. He considered certain moments in the nature
of private and confidential communications: for example, those few
seconds after Bud’s departure when Roxie, in gratitude, had stood there
so silently in the moonlight, her face uplifted to his. He was sure she
had been moved by nothing but girlish gratitude and had no conception
of the astonishingly dramatic picture she made. Yet he never mentioned
the incident. His conclusion from this point on was matter-of-fact
enough.

“So I took her to the house and then came home--striking into the woods
instead of keeping to the road.”

“You were wise in that,” said Howe.

“The trouble was I discovered my gun was empty,” laughed Allston. “The
last time I used it I popped away at some squirrels on the road. I’d
already wasted the one shell I had on Bud and I was afraid a second
bluff might not work.”

“Good Lord!” gasped Howe. “Bluff _is_ a dangerous game to play against
that kind of man. You don’t realize how recklessly they kill. They
never reckon consequences.”

“Well,” said Allston, willing enough to forget the whole affair, “here
I am back again, at any rate. I’m sorry if I’ve kept you up.”

Wilmer rose.

“You must be tired after your long tramp. You’ll let me make you a cup
of coffee?”

“Please don’t trouble,” he pleaded.

No one had noticed the slight, tired-looking figure who had suddenly
appeared at the door leading from the kitchen. Her cheeks were flushed
after the stumbling journey she had taken at a run as long as her
breath held out. Her hair was awry and her face stained where she had
wiped away the perspiration with an earth-soiled hand. Below her eyes
were other streaks--channels made by tears forced from her, not by
maudlin grief, but sheer elemental anger because her feet would not
carry her faster; the helpless rage of one baffled in an overwhelming
effort.

“Roxie!” exclaimed Wilmer as she caught sight of the girl.

“Please, I’ll git him his coffee,” she panted.




CHAPTER VII


In a cane-bottomed chair beside the threshold of the post-office--a
flimsy board building owing all its distinction, like a dirty uniform,
to the magic influence of those two letters U.S.--sat Daddie Ingram
during that social hour preceding the arrival of the mail. He himself
owed much of his prestige to his association, as postmaster, with the
Federal Government--that vast power which makes its influence felt even
to the most remote hamlets. He had acquired a certain dignity because
of his affiliation with the Eagle Itself.

The hot sun had made the roads which centered here dusty. Even the
droning insects became half-hearted. Flies moved listlessly and became
lazily indifferent to the danger of hostile hands moving against them
with no spirit. Men slouched up to the weather-worn porch and sank
down with a grunt, drawing their knees up and tilting their hats down.
Some of them whittled, but none of them were sufficiently inspired to
attempt any creative effort, unless perhaps a long spindling toothpick
sharpened with extreme care to a needle point.

Over his befogged spectacles, Daddie Ingram’s faded blue eyes
brightened a trifle as they observed the approach of Mr. Howe down the
road. He spat and shifted his quid in order to be in readiness for a
conversation which he had anticipated for several hours. He introduced
his subject without preliminaries as soon as Howe was safely within
range.

“Hear that young man up at yo’ house had a sort of run-in with Bud
Childers last night.”

Howe was surprised--unpleasantly surprised. He had rather hoped the
affair might not become current gossip. The moment this became public
property it complicated matters a good deal.

“What did you hear?” questioned Howe without committing himself.

“Wull, I heard on two or three sides. Yes, suh, on two or three sides.”

Pausing a moment he added, as though after mature reflection:

“I heard it on two or three sides.”

“Childers been talking?”

“Ain’t no one heard him doin’ it,” replied Daddie cautiously. “Fust
pusson I seen who knowed anything ’bout it was little Tom Culley. Said
old Widder Kester giv’ him the devil this mornin’ for carryin’ a lie
’bout her bein’ sick. Tom said he told her who give him the message.
Tom he went to Bud an’ Bud was fightin’ mad--all riled up about it.
Then Tom ’lowed he was gonter cut up thet young man up to yo’ house.”

“Well?”

“Bud’s bad,” drawled Daddie Ingram. “Yessuh, he’s bad. Yessuh, he’s bad
medicine. That young man up to yo’ house might erve needed a gun and a
good un.”

Howe spoke deliberately now.

“Mr. Allston is just out of the army. He has a gun and he knows how to
use it.”

“Wull, he might erve needed a good un. Yessuh, he might erve.”

“He will use it--if it’s necessary. But he isn’t looking for any
trouble which isn’t forced on him.”

“Looks like an awful nice feller,” admitted Daddie. “That clever an’
friendly. I’m powerful glad he’s got a gun. Better carry it, too.”

Turge Calhoun, a dwarfed, fleshless little man who looked as though he
had been long hung upon a nail to dry, looked up with interest. Then he
broke out into uncanny laughter--a piercing falsetto.

“Turge--he knows Bud,” nodded Ingram phlegmatically.

Howe attended to his business inside and went back home frankly
disturbed. It was clear enough that this group, while not actually
hostile to Allston, looked forward with considerable pleasant
anticipation to a second run-in between him and Bud. They intended to
go even further--as far as it was possible by innuendo and goading
they would spur Bud on. There was both amusement and excitement in the
situation--just as in a cock or a dog fight. They were no more apt to
consider consequences than Bud was--less, in view of the fact that they
themselves were not in danger.

Anxious as Howe was, he felt quite helpless. He knew there was no
authority of the law he could invoke. Officers are powerless until
after a crime is committed. Moreover, it is doubtful if he would
find local officials sympathetic, anyway. It was even more doubtful
if he himself was in sympathy with any such method of procedure.
Difficulties of this nature could not be settled by law. Allston would
be the last man in the world to listen to such a proposal.

Obviously the simplest way out, if it could be managed, would be to
place the two men beyond reach of one another. But it was as much out
of the question to think of shifting Bud Childers as it was Green
Mountain or Big Laurel Cove or Caterpillar Ridge. As for moving Allston
out of danger, it seemed equally impossible except by resorting to some
ruse. This course was as distinctly against Howe’s own nature as he
knew it would be against that of his guest.

Howe did not repeat his conversation with Daddie Ingram either to his
daughter or to Allston. To do so would be only to frighten the former
and rouse, possibly to aggressive action, the latter. But he did
persuade Allston to keep his automatic always in his pocket and to make
sure it was loaded.

“Don’t pop away at any more squirrels,” he warned. “If you do, reload.
You’ll need a full hand the next time you call that man.”

Allston heeded the advice, although even now he was by no means
convinced that any such precaution was necessary. However, he had
toted a gun so much during the past two years that he found it no
great burden and this was an easy way to please his host. And Allston
was anxious, in every way, to please him. He felt, each day, under
a greater obligation. He had prolonged his visit with these amiable
people far beyond the limits the happy chance of his accidental
introduction to them warranted. And yet he stayed on, for every time
he suggested that he was straining his welcome he was met by such a
genuine protest from both father and daughter that he found it easy to
drift back into inaction.

This countryside was to his taste. He liked the contrast of rugged
hills with fertile valley; of the primeval mountain growth of huge
chestnut-oaks and laurel, with the luxuriant rhododendrons, tropical
in their leafy richness; of the cold streams and rough roads with the
formal orderliness of this well-kept summer place. He sensed something
of this dramatic contrast in these people who had come so unexpectedly
into his life. Bud and Roxie set against Howe and Wilmer heightened his
interest in both. They stood for two different periods. And yet for
all he knew the difference between them might not be as great as it
seemed.

That was the striking fact against which he was continually bumping
during the war; the amazing likeness of peoples he had always
considered so essentially different, and the amazing differences
between those he thought identical. This held true even of different
civilizations. It held true of different historical epochs. The past
and the present were all jumbled together over there just as the dead
and the living were. It was sometimes difficult to distinguish one
from the other. And they were easily interchangeable. He remembered
with particular vividness an old French town in which he had been
billeted--a town dating back, not years like towns at home, but
centuries. If anything might be thought to be deep-rooted and fixed in
its associations with the past, it was this stone village, gray and
heavy with age. And yet in a night Allston had seen a rude interruption
of its traditions. The inhabitants had been hurried away to escape
heavy gunfire when he and a few other officers entered the silent
streets. Only the empty shell of this ancient town remained. Yet doors
were open, tables set, beds in order. Even the old town clock was
going. It made him jump when it struck out with leisurely resonance and
indifferent concern each passing hour. But the population, boasting
kinship back to Cæsar, had vanished in a day to give place to a few
sprightly young officers bred in a country which three hundred years
before had been savage. These soldier cubs ate at the time-stained
tables, slept in the hallowed beds, while the night stars looked down
undisturbed.

It was not easy after this for Allston to believe that centuries
counted for much towards stability. It was still more difficult when
a little later he saw varying breeds of men tearing at each other’s
throats like jungle beasts. He was one of them and tore as hard as
any. And then--presto--this was over and the breeds became polite and
civilized again, and the ancient townsfolk returned to their abodes
and remade their beds and reset their tables and sent Allston and the
others--such of them as were not buried with the dead centurions--back
to their own young land.

An experience like this made a man cautious about fixing boundaries
either of time or space. It drove a man back of history to a primitive
brotherhood which discovered men and women, of whatever clime and of
whatever period, to be much alike.

And yet he was inclined even now to make an exception of Wilmer. It
was difficult for him to conceive any set of circumstances which could
affect the cultivated poise of her calm nature or disturb to any extent
her steady control based upon a fine intelligence. It amused him to
imagine how she would have acted under the conditions existing in that
little French town so suddenly shaken from its venerable security. He
could not picture her then as any other than she was now. She would
have remained had that been possible. If not she would have walked out
calmly, looking upon the interruption as an ugly interlude, but quite
unchanged by it. But she would be beautiful, with a sort of saintly
beauty, both in going and returning.

In many ways this steadiness, this assurance, this complete confidence
in herself, the product of a ripe development a little beyond her
years, appealed strongly to him. She stood out in his lately troubled
world like the North star over a stormy sea. He welcomed her because
she seemed to guide him back to that snug harbor in which he had ridden
so safely at anchor beneath a golden sun and an azure sky until the
war bade him set sail. In her presence he was able to dream pleasantly
and lazily again as he had in college. And rather sentimentally too.
This was an agreeable surprise. He thought all that had been burned out
of him. During those few days at home he had been astonished at how
unresponsive he had been to the pretty young faces about him. But they
had chattered about the war and his nerves had been more jumpy than
they now were.

He had steadied down a lot since then. He could thank Wilmer’s deep
brown eyes for that--and her soft, musical voice, never raised, but
clear and distinct as a silver bell. He liked to listen to it in the
evening as she read aloud to her father, though often he found himself
hearing nothing but the voice. He was quite sure that if interested in
the text he would do much better to read to himself. But he seldom was
interested. He much preferred talking with her when she had no book in
her hand.

He much preferred talking to her about--almost nothing at all. She was
a good walker, and they used to start on long tramps through the woods
for the neighboring hills. Always it was to some definite point like
Caterpillar Ridge. Never on these hikes did they succeed in reaching
their objective. Allston, at times, felt rather mean about that because
it seemed to disturb her. And it obliged him to adopt the rather
underhanded expedient of allowing her to believe that the bit of gas he
had once inhaled was responsible for his weakness, when, as a matter of
fact, it was nothing but the joy of sprawling out lazily at her feet.
He had never felt better in his life and he knew it.

He used to pick out the sunny places--tiny coves lying like pockets or
mountain nests at the foot of bold rocks. If he could find one near
a brook, so much the better, for this gave him the excuse of fishing
while the rippling tinkle of the falling water sang with her a duet. It
is not on record that he brought home any fish, but this was of minor
importance. Your true sportsman never fishes for the sake of fish.

But always he brought home something--if only the memory of a dimpling
smile caught unexpectedly in response to some bit of fooling. He liked
to make her smile unexpectedly. It was like angling in an untried
brook. Her eyes were the pools--so deep that one could not see bottom.
And like mountain pools continually filling with fresh water, her
thoughts ran through them. One could never tell when a smile, like a
quick trout, might flash into them from somewhere, and jump at his
bait. That was worth waiting for.

So they sat one afternoon just off the road leading to Big Laurel
Cove--not knowing except in a general way where they were. It would not
have mattered greatly to Allston had he realized he was within a short
distance of Bud Childers’s shack. As far as he was concerned at this
time Bud Childers did not exist.




CHAPTER VIII


Bud Childers, however, did exist. He existed more intensely than ever.
From the moment he met Allston and Roxie together he had burned like a
man with a fever.

It was a dangerous fever--a fever bred of baffled desire, of jealousy,
of hate. Since he had been old enough to stand on his two feet and
fight back, he had never been bullied as Allston had bullied him.
Always he had been able to leave his mark even if meeting defeat in the
end. But in the last ten years he had never until now met defeat.

To this humiliating reversal Allston had added the insult of humbling
him before Roxie. How Bud ever found his way back to Big Laurel Cove
that night he never knew, for if ever a man was blind with rage it was
he; literally blind. He saw nothing of the rocky road over which he
traveled, but he took it at a gallop, cursing the mare and digging his
heels into her sides whenever she paused. He turned her into the barn
all dripping with lather as she was and never removed her saddle. Then
he stumbled to his house and locked himself in.

He had not waited for Allston that evening nor attempted to trail him
home. He knew better than that. He must see straight and have a steady
hand when he met the man again. In the condition he was then in he
could not have been sure of his aim at ten feet. And he meant to be
sure--next time.

But the process of calming down was no simple one. Hour after hour
he paced his cabin floor until finally, exhausted, he tumbled into
a heap on his bed and slept. When he awoke it was the same thing
all over again. And yet slowly, out of this jumble of emotions, two
finally detached themselves or perhaps absorbed the others; hate--black
hate--of this man Allston, and love--fire-like love--of Roxie Kester.

Or perhaps his passion resolved itself, in the final analysis, into the
single passion of love. For Love is the mother of every passion, and
mother-like shelters all her brood, even those which turn against her
and eat away at her heart. A man may hate beyond the possibility of
loving, but a man may love and yet hate at one and the same time.

If Bud had desired Roxie before, he desired her with a fervor a hundred
times as strong now. There were moments when she drove every other
desire out of his head and heart--even all thought of Allston. Whenever
he was able to let himself go utterly, she washed away even those
crimson spots that danced before his eyes. It was then as though just
he and she were alone in the world. Yet they knew not loneliness. Two
only they might be out of hundreds of millions, but it was the hundreds
of millions who were alone, not they. Because they would be up here on
this mountain-side where the trees were many and friendly, where the
birds and squirrels would be their playmates by day; where, by night,
the stars and planets would be their fellows. Bud was never as definite
as that, but something of the sort he sensed whenever he thought of
her. She was more one with such things than she was with folk--even as
he was. He had always been able to get along up here. The trees and the
denizens among them had never interfered with him. Forest creatures let
a man alone. And he, in his way, had always been kind to them. He had
a feel for them. Animals were not afraid of him, though often enough
he lost his temper and abused them, and, when necessary, killed them
without emotion. But he spent weeks nursing an injured chicken back
to health and kept an old gray horse for years after she was quite
useless. No dog had ever come to his shack for food and gone away
hungry, though many a man had done so.

Bud had a notion that it was not man who was basic, but Nature.
This new love of his--for it was new, a development of his initial
desire--was one with Nature. It had to do with elemental things. Had
he been religious he might have said it had to do with God. But after
that, to have been consistent, he would have had to say this black hate
had to do with the Devil.

He might not have been far wrong at that. Whenever it pounced upon him
he was like one possessed. It bred murder in his heart--the lust to
kill. A dozen times his eyes had burned with evil satisfaction at the
picture of Allston in his death agonies. He had heard the bark of his
own pistol and seen the man crumple up, falling to this side and that,
his eyes rolling, his face writhing with pain. Leeringly he had looked
on, watching to the last gasp.

Only one thing had stayed his hand as long as this. He wanted Allston
to die, but he himself wanted to live. Never before had he considered
himself when in such a mood. He had always moved recklessly. This new
element made him move cautiously. To die would be to lose Roxie in
another way. To have her, he must live. He needed years to satisfy
himself with her. He might need years to satisfy her with him.

Life--the ability to see, hear, and feel her--he must retain. He must
not jeopardize a second of it. When he shot, it must be from ambush
with no traces left. He must await his opportunity--perhaps contrive it.

The opportunity came sooner than he expected and with no contriving.
It came one afternoon when in descending the mountain road, his keen
nostrils caught a new scent in the still air. It was tobacco smoke, but
not of his kind. It was neither plug nor Bull Durham, but something
more pungent. He had caught the same spicy aroma once or twice when the
summerers were loafing around the post-office waiting for the mail--the
men in white flannels and immaculate shirts. It was the kind that only
pink-cheeked strangers smoked.

Bud stiffened like a pointing bird dog. He stood so, listening, for
almost a full minute. He regulated even his breathing. Then slowly he
moved his hand back to his big-calibred revolver until his fingers
gripped the handle. The feel of it calmed his twitching muscles.

A light breeze coming out of the woods on his left, where a branch
of the stream which ran by his shack had its source, gave him his
direction. He knew every foot of those woods as he did for miles around
his place. He knew even the little cove where a man would be likely to
stop to rest.

Carefully Bud moved one foot, looking to see where to rest it, lest a
crackling twig give warning. So step by step he made his way among the
trees--taking a half-hour to go a few hundred yards. But when, through
the branches, he made out clearly the form of Allston sitting on the
ground, he felt the time well spent--even though, to his surprise, he
discovered that the man was not alone. He saw red for a second as he
caught sight of a woman’s skirt. Then, as he discerned who the other
was, he steadied. There was only one woman in the world who had the
power to stay his fingers on the trigger. And that one was not Wilmer
Howe.




CHAPTER IX


For a few moments Bud Childers, safely hidden in the undergrowth,
studied Allston as he sat within a few feet of Wilmer Howe in that
sunlit cove on the side of Green Mountain. His long, bony fingers
grasped firmly the gun with which he meant to kill this man. He
had awaited his opportunity and here it was. He would have gambled
a hundred to one that no power on earth could swerve him from his
purpose, for it was backed by deadly hatred and jealousy and the
burning hunger for revenge for the deep humiliation he had been made
to suffer before the woman he loved. It was possible, from his present
strategic point, to shoot and vanish. His guilt might be suspected
afterwards, but no one could definitely establish it. There were
other men in these mountains besides himself ready enough to shoot at
strangers when they wandered loosely among the coves. Too many hidden
stills existed hereabouts to make outsiders welcome.

Bud’s face flushed as he watched Allston take leisurely puffs of the
Turkish cigarette he held in his white fingers. And his lip curled in
scorn as he noted the belted Norfolk jacket, the golf trousers and long
stockings, the shiny, low shoes--all marks to him of effeminacy. But
the smooth-shaven face, with its clear pink skin showing through the
slight tan, seemed to irritate him more than anything else. His own was
dark and tough as leather. So should every man’s be who was a man.

It was to this fellow Bud had seen Roxie cling in the moonlit road. How
much she meant by it he did not know, but she had meant enough so that
she had turned away from him on the very night he intended to claim
her. She had turned away from her own kind to a stranger because of his
store clothes and his lily-white fingers and his pink cheeks and his
school-taught way of speaking. She liked ’um that way. He had taunted
her with that and she made no reply.

Bud raised his gun with care not to disturb as much as a twig. He did
not dare wait longer, for the sight of the man and the ugly memories he
brought fresh to mind revived the old fever that blinded his eyes and
unsteadied his hand. Blood-red anger does not make for sure shooting.
And yet he must not hurry. He could not afford to risk more than one
shot and he must not merely wound. To leave Allston crippled would be
worse than nothing. That would excite only sympathy without definitely
ending the affair. So he took his time.

Bud’s finger muscles had actually begun to press against the heavy
trigger, his bead drawn fair on Allston’s heart, when he saw something
that made him pause. It was a simple act; Allston suddenly tossed aside
his cigarette and seized the girl’s hand. Bud could not catch the man’s
words, but he saw Wilmer Howe spring to her feet. He saw Allston rise
beside her.

Bud still had a good target--an even better target than before. And yet
his gun began to lower. This situation interested him. He could catch
Allston’s words now.

“Oh, I’m sorry, Wilmer,” he exclaimed. “But your hand was so near.”

Her face was scarlet.

“I didn’t expect that sort of thing from you,” she answered, avoiding
his eyes.

“I didn’t expect it of myself,” he said. “Honest, I didn’t. I--I lost
my head for a moment.”

“That is just what I didn’t expect.”

“I can’t explain it any further,” he confessed.

“It’s the sort of thing that can’t be explained,” she replied.

There was no quaver in her voice--only a note of deep regret.

“And yet,” went on Allston, passing his hand over his eyes--“and yet
there was something. It was almost--almost as though I were in danger.
Your fingers were near and I seized them. That sounds absurd, doesn’t
it?”

“Yes,” she answered steadily, “it does.”

“Perhaps I’m more used to absurd things than you,” he went on with a
worried smile. “They were always happening--over there.”

“That sort?” she questioned.

“All sorts. You never knew. You just acted without knowing why.”

“It’s a rather dangerous way, isn’t it?”

“Yes.”

“And it doesn’t make it easy for a woman to trust a man who--who acts
in that way, does it?”

“No.”

“Then--perhaps we had best be going.”

“I’ve hurt you as deeply as that?” he exclaimed.

She started forward a step. Again Bud raised his gun and covered
his man. And yet, even as he did so, he felt that here was a new
development which he ought to consider. If he had time, he would
consider it. If this man was sweet on Wilmer Howe, it eliminated him
more effectively from Roxie’s life than his death would do. And this
without the margin of danger that was bound to follow any shooting.

Allston hurried to her side with a cry that made the girl pause.

“Wilmer,” he said huskily, “Wilmer, if--if you go like this I can never
forgive myself. I’ve acted like a cad, but you must show that you trust
me again.”

“How can I do that?”

“Come back and sit down where you were. That’s all I ask. Sit here a
little while longer with me and then--and then we’ll go back home and
I’ll pack my bag.”

She met his eyes at that.

“You mean--?”

“I’ve overstayed in the Garden of Eden--by one day,” he answered.

“But dad--what will dad think?”

“You’re going to make it hard for me to face your father if you leave
me with the feeling I’ve abused his generous hospitality.”

“I don’t want you to feel like that,” she protested.

“Then--”

Her face grew even more scarlet as she slowly moved back to the flat
rock upon which she had been seated. Allston again took his place at
her feet. Again Bud released the grip on his gun.

There was much here he did not understand; there was something here
he did--even better than Allston. It was clear to him that the
pink-cheeked fool had some one now in whom he was more interested
than in Roxie. If he went to Roxie and told her this--reported how he
had seen Allston hold Wilmer Howe’s hand and heard him speaking his
school-taught talk to her up here alone in the cove--she might change
her mind about this stranger. If he knew Roxie she would turn against
the man as quickly as she had turned to him. She would hate him with as
black a hate as he did. She would see him as he was.

Bud was not much given to diplomacy nor to much fine reasoning, but
here was a suggestion that appealed to him. It was based first of
all upon the idea of self-protection which in turn went back to his
new-found zest in life. He wanted to live and he did not mean to take
any unnecessary chances. With everything in his favor, a man who has
killed is not in as secure a position as a man who has not killed.
There is always the danger that something unforeseen may happen. The
officers had rounded up Roge Enfield after he knifed Pete Calhoun in
spite of every effort made to protect him.

Allston might get out of this country at once as he had hinted to
Wilmer Howe, or he might stay long enough to marry this woman. He’d
be going, anyhow, before winter. And either way he’d be leaving Roxie
forever. He’d be leaving Roxie just as soon as Bud could get word to
her of what he had seen.

Bud lowered his gun. It was too bad to miss a dead-sure thing like
this, but the new plan was worth trying. If it was not as satisfactory
in many ways as shooting, it was safer.

When Bud took his first careful step back through the bushes, it marked
a significant stage in his development. For the first time in his life
he had allowed Reason to dictate to passion. His impulse still was to
kill. In not obeying it he was making a real personal sacrifice. And
though fundamentally he was governed by selfish motives--perhaps reason
makes for selfishness--he was also allowing the interests of another
to play a part in his decision. However indirectly, he was considering
Roxie to a degree. If his chief concern was with the happiness she
would bring him, he was also honestly convinced that it was within his
power to bring happiness to her. He was going to allow her to go to the
village and buy whatever she wished--calico for dresses, ribbons for
her hair, candy and everything. Within a week he had got his eye on
another horse that would be good for her to ride. And he was going to
wipe his feet whenever he came into the house. And wash his hands if
she insisted upon it. All those hopes contributed towards his desire
to live--made him willing to give up his desire to kill when this
conflicted with those other interests.

Step by step Bud felt his way back to the road. And then, walking free
and easy, undisturbed now by the noise of his firm feet crunching twig
and rock, he returned to his shack on Big Laurel. He went about his
farm work whistling. It was something of a relief not to care who heard
him.




CHAPTER X


For centuries philosophers have attempted to disentangle dreams from
reality and to fix definite boundaries between the two. They have not
found it easy. It is doubtful whether, even if possible, this would
prove worth while except for the satisfaction it would bring the
philosophers. Probably when the latter are all done with their grave
conclusions people will continue to mix the two agreeably to their own
lives.

If deep-browed academicians have found the task of separation
difficult, certainly Roxie Kester cannot be blamed if she did not
succeed and so kept right on with her dreaming. Particularly after
that wonderful evening when Allston stood by her side like a veritable
knight of old. For he had seemed to her then nothing short of
magnificent. And yet, unlike most magnificent things in her life--such
as story-book heroes and angels and gallant men of whom she read in the
papers during the war--not remote. He had been near enough to touch. He
_had_ touched her; had held her hands for a moment. How the stars had
swam before her then! How close, at that moment, her dreams had seemed
to reality. She had been ready to give herself up to them utterly. She
had been ready to give herself up to him had he but asked or, not even
asking, had taken. A little later, recalling her emotion, she had grown
big-eyed, but she did not deny the fact. She had been quite helpless.
And she was not ashamed of it. He had fought for her, twice risked his
life for her, and she was his if he wished. Not that she had any very
definite idea of what that meant. Few of her ideas were definite. They
were scarcely more than instincts, warning her here and urging her on
there, but always proving themselves sound and sweet and true.

Roxie thought of love as she thought of Heaven--a condition of complete
happiness necessarily obscure until actually experienced. It was
quite detached from marriage, or marriage, at any rate, as she saw it
exemplified in the lives about her. Here it meant housekeeping and
scarcely anything more than housekeeping. Marriage marked the end
of youth; the beginning of old age. It was a serious, more or less
matter-of-fact estate into which women entered, not because they
wished, but because it was inevitable. It was what Bud Childers had
proposed for her. It was what, for the time being at any rate, Allston
had saved her from.

Love was something entirely different; as different as poetry from
prose; as different as dreams from reality. It even turned prose into
poetry and reality into dreams. It glorified everything like spring.
It made flowers grow beneath her feet; made the birds break forth
into song when she walked abroad; it deepened the blue of the sky and
burnished the gold of the sun; it put her in touch everywhere with the
beautiful. It even brought out the beauty in her own face and figure.

Roxie was not vain, although she knew well enough she compared
favorably with other girls in the village. But lately, when standing
before the mirror while doing her hair for the night, she had looked at
herself a little more critically. And with a thrill of pride she had
not discovered much with which to find fault. Her light hair was long
and silken and responded with an added sheen to the careful combing she
now gave it. Her blue eyes stared back at her with a new light which
quickened them. Her skin was clear and though slightly more tanned than
Miss Wilmer’s had a creamy bloom the latter lacked. Her nose and mouth
and chin were not much and yet not badly modeled. Her teeth were large
and not as pearly white as Miss Wilmer’s, but they were strong and,
ever since the teacher at school had taught her to use a toothbrush,
had improved. Her body was lithe and firm, but she did not think much
about that. Except, she could not help but notice, she looked her best
when in her long white night-robe which gave her full freedom and
revealed the fine curves of her neck and her slight, rounded arms. She
blushed even as she noted this and was glad enough to blow out her lamp
and shelter herself in the dark.

She awoke every morning as fresh and clear-visioned as the dawn. She
awoke with the physical vigor of a young animal ready to frolic and
with her eyes wide open. She dressed as quickly as a boy and went down
to her tasks with a song in her heart. For she was kindling the morning
fire, not for Miss Wilmer, but for Allston. She threw open windows to
let in the cool, fragrant new air, not for her mistress, but for him.
For him she started the kettle to boiling and for him mixed her batter
for hot bread. This was his house. He was the host and the others
guests.

At odd times he stepped into the kitchen to say Hello. That was
something to look forward to and later to remember. She made it a point
always to be wearing a clean gingham apron.

“Do you know,” he said to her, dropping in just before supper, “you
look as though you grew in the field like the daisies and some one
plucked you fresh every day. You sure that isn’t true?”

She shook her head.

“Flowers are pretty, but they don’t last long,” she said.

“And yet they are everywhere. They were even in France--on the
battle-fields.”

Roxie often carried Allston’s thoughts back to those days by
suggestions of one kind and another. And he never resented this.
She never made him feel that he was recalling past events for the
entertainment of an outsider. It was more as though she helped him live
over again the pleasanter details. She accepted them as he had done at
the time, simply and naïvely.

“But I don’t know if it’s any stranger to find them in France than in
my room every day,” he went on with a smile. “How do they get on my
table?”

“I put them there,” she answered directly. “Don’t you like them?”

“Very much. It’s mighty kind of you, Roxie. About this time, three
years back, there was a lady in France who used to do that for me.”

She looked up quickly.

“A girl?” she asked.

“A lady--a very old lady.”

“Oh.”

“But the flowers were young. Flowers are always young, aren’t they?”

“Until they die.”

“Who knows? They may be young after that.”

“Maybe,” she nodded seriously.

“How old are you?”

“Eighteen. How old are you?”

“Twenty-four.”

“Seems like you was younger.”

“Is that very old, Roxie?”

“No, sir, that ain’t very old,” she hastened to assure him, fearing
she had offended. “No, sir, only seems like I’d be old when I was
twenty-four.”

“I doubt it--if you keep growing in the field. You’ll come up every
spring.”

“Seems sometimes like it was spring always.”

“What?” he questioned. “That sounds as though you were in love.”

Her cheeks flamed scarlet at that. He noticed it before she could turn.
He studied her pretty back as she bent her head over her work and the
curve of her neck where the soft hair grows.

“Roxie,” he said without moving, in a lowered voice, “is love like
that?”

“I dunno,” she answered weakly.

He scarcely heard her reply. His thoughts this time had gone back,
not to France, but to a tiny sunlit cove on the mountain-side; to the
impulsive clasp of a warm hand which had left him worried ever since.

“It might be like that,” he said. “That’s what the poets are always
singing, isn’t it?”

“I dunno,” she repeated.

He roused himself.

“I don’t know either,” he said. “But perhaps some day we may find
out--both of us. It sounds reasonable, anyhow.”

He went out leaving Roxie alone with her burning thoughts while he
reviewed his own.

It would seem that with all that has been written about love by both
philosophers and romanticists; with all the lovers there have been in
the world since the world began who have recorded their experiences
in song and story and memoirs; with all that a man sees and hears of
love with his own ears and his own eyes before he has reached twenty,
there should be little chance left for speculation on the part of any
one. And yet here was Allston, who had read a good bit and had seen a
good bit, unable to recognize it either in himself or in others. It was
as though he found himself in some newly discovered land about which
he must feel his way cautiously lest he lose his direction. It was as
though he were upon some untried venture.

He had, of course, a sentimental notion of what love meant, but this
did not seem to the point. It was not that which had made him reach
for Wilmer’s hand. He had said at the time he could not explain his
act, and that was true. His impulse had come from deep within. But
stranger than this was the effect this brief contact produced in him.
The effrontery of it, which had at first startled them both, she seemed
ready to forgive, and this, in turn, allowed him to forget that crass
feature. But this by no means settled the matter. Their relations were
not what they had been before. He saw this in her eyes suddenly grown
timid; he felt it in his own changed attitude when with her.

She had become, he would have said, more human. Until now she had been
no more than an intellectual pastime, like a pleasant and not too
baffling problem in chess. He had enjoyed moving this way and that in
order to see how she would respond. When he made her smile, he felt
that he had scored Check, although more often than not she moved easily
out of danger. This seemed like an amusing and safe diversion for them
both. With nothing at stake it mattered little who won.

But the touch of her warm fingers--brief as it was--had proved her of
flesh and blood. It seemed strange after this that he had ever doubted
it. On the walk home from the cove that late afternoon he was conscious
of it every minute. He saw her try to resume the old game at the point
where it had been so rudely interrupted and saw her fail, though
he did his best to help her. He himself tried and failed. For long
intervals they walked in silence--a dangerous silence.

That evening she came down to supper light-heartedly enough and in
a pretty new gown. For the first time since his stay here Allston
could have told with some detail just what she wore. It was a light,
gauzy thing of a bluish tint with rosebuds peeping out from the
skirt beneath. Her hair was done high and fastened with a large
tortoise-shell comb. The walk had so crimsoned her cheeks that her
father noticed it.

“You’re looking very fine to-night,” he said.

“Thank you, dad,” she answered.

Allston wished to add his testimony, but when he met her brown eyes he
decided not to venture. But at that he honestly did think she looked
very fine.

Howe appeared troubled with Allston’s lack of success in the
neighboring streams. He had recommended them--on hearsay evidence, to
be sure--and held himself more or less responsible.

“It’s odd you don’t have better luck,” he said at supper. “I’ve always
understood the fishing around here was excellent--particularly for
bass.”

“It is,” answered Allston. “But I’ve been fishing for trout.”

“Well, it seems as though you ought to get a trout occasionally.”

“I’m afraid it’s been my fault,” broke in Wilmer. “I think Mr. Allston
will have to try his luck alone for a while.”

“I might get more fish,” admitted Allston. “But I wouldn’t have as much
pleasure.”

“Trout are wary,” said Howe.

“As wary as smiles,” admitted Allston.

“I did more or less fishing when a boy,” ran on Howe. “The streams were
better stocked then.”

“But the woods were not any sweeter nor the sun any brighter,”
suggested Allston. “And that after all is what counts. I haven’t a
complaint to make--unless it is of to-day.”

“Why of to-day?” questioned Howe.

“I didn’t give enough attention to my fishing.”

“And lost a big one? They always bite best when your head is turned.”

“My head _was_ turned,” replied Allston, looking across the table at
Wilmer. She was very busy at that moment pouring tea.

“You will have sugar to-night?”

“All you’ll give me.”

“That’s too bad,” Howe consoled him. “I hope you’ll have better luck
next time.”

“I shall certainly try to keep my head another time,” declared Allston.

It was not easy, however, even for the remainder of that evening. He
had never before minded the presence of her father, but from this point
on he found himself contriving all sorts of little subterfuges for
isolating her. She managed to foil them all without permitting him to
know whether it was deliberate or not. To-night she consumed at least
two hours in reading the New Orleans papers until he heartily wished
that New Orleans could be blotted from the map. And yet, had it not
been for the papers and those droning market quotations on sugar, the
chances are that Howe would not have impolitely closed his dear old
eyes and gone off peacefully to sleep. The girl herself did not notice
until Allston rose and touched her shoulder, pointing at the dozing
figure.

“Let’s go out on the porch,” he whispered. “We mustn’t disturb him.”

She hesitated--evidently uneasy.

“You don’t want to wake him, do you? You know he hasn’t been sleeping
very well lately.”

Which was true enough.

Reluctantly she rose and yet with a curious sort of reluctance too; a
reluctance that expressed itself in a choking kind of eagerness. Out
there he faced her in the light of a waning moon.

“You didn’t mean what you said about letting me fish alone?” he
demanded.

“It--it might be best,” she answered.

“It would be like sending me into exile, and you don’t want to do that,
do you?”

“I don’t know,” she answered with almost the bewilderment of a child.
“Oh, I don’t know anything.”

It was strange that her phrase should have recalled to him the
half-heard phrase Roxie had used. The latter had said, “I dunno” in
answer to the question he had asked, carelessly enough, of her.

“Everything seems to be getting down to that,” he muttered. “I don’t
know very much myself.”




CHAPTER XI


It was not often that Wilmer remained long awake after retiring to
her room. Her days came to a calm and untroubled close with the first
approach of drowsiness. The problems which claimed her attention were
either of that minor daylight character familiar to all housekeepers or
else of so purely an academic nature--being largely those offered by
the younger British novelists--that they were as easily laid aside at
night as her walking boots.

But this evening, instead of hurrying into bed after blowing out her
light, she slipped on a dainty negligee and sat by the open window.
She enjoyed the feel of the fresh night breeze on her white forehead
and warm face. The moon had already lost one section of its brilliant
circumference, but enough was left to bathe in a translucent glow the
encircling hills which shut in the sleeping valley covered now with a
silver veil. A cluster of chestnut-oaks stood below her window slightly
to the left of the porch. Fleeting bits of light sifted through the
luxuriant foliage like drops of silver rain. The scene before her
eyes was both clear and vague; many bits easily recognizable, but the
rest complicated with full-bodied shadows. She knew every inch of it,
and yet it was veiled in mystery. Knowing there was nothing to fear,
still she would have been afraid to walk abroad alone. She would not
trust her intelligence to keep in leash her imagination. And yet if her
intellect could not do that for her, it was serving her ill.

It was--in other ways. Reason should have told her she was making too
much of the incident of the afternoon. To treat that seriously was to
make too much of Allston himself. And this was dangerous. It destroyed
perspective and cloaked the man in mystery--as the night light did the
familiar acres and trees before her. This left her the prey to all
sorts of illusions--to all sorts of unwarranted timidities. It took
her back to childhood and virginal ignorance. This, after her reading
had turned the searchlight upon one shadow after another revealing the
stark truth.

The stark truth was sometimes unpleasant; sometimes tediously
innocuous. Never was it romantic. Most men, it seems, were the slaves
of fleeting passions; most women, their victims. This ended sometimes
in tragedy; sometimes in comedy; sometimes in nothing at all. The
greatest tragedy to her was when it ended in nothing at all. She had
an orderly mind and liked to reach definite conclusions. She found
vagueness depressing.

Yet that appeared to be the spirit of the day. No one knew anything
with certainty whether of politics or religion or human nature. She
herself had clung persistently to most of the doctrines of her father
in politics and religion, and found them adequate. But she could not
accept his trusting confidence in the inherent honesty of men, except
those of his generation. The world was simpler in his day.

She had liked Allston from the start and been willing to accept him, up
to a certain point, at his face value. She never expected to go beyond
that point. As long as she viewed him merely objectively, she found him
distinctly entertaining and a decided addition to her list of friends.
Considering the circumstances of his introduction to the household, she
was warranted in believing that here their relations would end. It was
on this theory she had allowed herself so much freedom with him.

Now this was all changed. He had thrust himself upon her attention
in another fashion. When he seized her hand, the act, in itself, was
trivial enough, as he had argued. But what it connoted was not trivial.
And the effect it produced on her was not trivial. The blood which
rushed to her face was not in protest at his boldness, even though
for self-protection she had been obliged to make him think so. In
reality it was a startling confession of weakness in herself. Had she
been coldly indifferent or even righteously indignant, she could have
forgotten the incident. But she could not forget the surge of a far
different emotion that had swept through her.

She had handled herself well considering the strength and
unexpectedness of this attack. The carefully erected barriers of years
had been swept away. She had found herself standing, self-dependent,
facing this man in the grip of a passion so primitive it shocked her.
She had been thrilled by the clasp of his strong fingers. For a few
dizzy seconds she was merely some captured thing glad of her capture.
Had she obeyed her desires, she would not have struggled at all--would
neither have withdrawn her hand nor chided him.

Wilmer faced the truth mercilessly. She made no attempt to equivocate
or to excuse herself, though even here in the privacy of her room her
cheeks flamed scarlet once again. She had been governed by instincts
as primitive as anything she might expect of Roxie and she knew it. To
be sure, she had conquered them. In the space of half a dozen frantic
heartbeats she had mastered herself. But this did not blot out those
other few seconds.

And now to explain it--and she must explain it to maintain her
self-respect--she was driven to the use of the word love; the word she
prided herself on being able to regard with almost cynical scorn. It
was not like this that she had expected love to come, if ever it did
come into her life. If she was not yet twenty-five, she was no longer
seventeen. She was supposed to be sufficiently well disciplined to
analyze even this passion intelligently. If not, all her reading and
thought were to little purpose. The first appeal of a lover to her
should be through intellect and character, not through the emotions.

It was some consolation to be able to admit that she could offer no
criticism of Allston’s character as far as it had been revealed to her.
As for his intellect, if it was not as acutely active as her ideal
called for, it was by no means negative. She might have been satisfied
with it--if only it mattered. But it did not.

She had not this afternoon, and she did not now, care a picayune about
his intellect. It was the beat of his pulse against her hand which had
swayed her. It was the feel of being in his possession that had taken
away her breath. It was the magic of his eyes seeking her eyes with an
insistence almost brutal which had swept her off her feet.

It was all those things which at this moment brought into her eyes
something of the mystery which the moon brought to the familiar picture
at which in awe she now gazed from her window. Her lips parted and she
pronounced his name--using quite unconsciously, because it expressed a
tenderness her mood demanded, a nickname she associated with a brother
who had died very young.

“Ned,” she repeated to herself.

The sound of the whispered name brought the man into such vivid being
that it was as though he stood beside her. She shrank away from the
window. She stared about the room in fear lest her boldness had
actually materialized him. Hurriedly she threw off her negligee and
running to the bed hid herself beneath the sheets.




CHAPTER XII


A rain lasting three days delayed Bud Childers. But with the cards he
now held he could afford to wait. Moreover, he found himself interested
in a new occupation. He could use this time to advantage in preparing
the shack for his prospective bride.

It is doubtful if any woman in the world save Roxie could have roused
in him such an ambition. This log house, substantially as it stood
to-day, had been adequate for him, for his father, for his father’s
father, and all the women who incidentally had lived here. He was ready
to maintain that it was good enough for any one--except Roxie. It was
essentially good enough for her. But living with the Howes had made her
fussy. And she was a little different, anyway. She liked purty things
and clean things.

The building was a one-story affair made of hewn trees with the bark
on. In the course of time much of this had fallen off leaving the bare
wood now weatherbeaten, showing a dull grayish brown. A flimsy porch
stood before it, the roof supported by posts of young chestnut-oaks. A
board door opened into the main living-room. This was finished roughly
with planed boards, but made rather attractive by a stone fireplace
blackened by the smoke from countless fires. Here Bud did most of his
cooking, though a room in the rear was intended to be a kitchen. Near
the dog-irons stood a black tin coffee-pot, and on the mantel above
were various earthen crocks which had served as cooking-utensils for
three generations. A few cane-bottomed straight-back chairs, a table
covered with cracked oilcloth, a small stove in the corner, the pipe
braced with rusted wires, a rifle and a long-barreled shotgun fastened
to the walls, a lithograph torn from an old patent-medicine calendar
representing dimly an elderly couple peacefully paring fruit, were the
only furnishings. On the wall to the right of the fireplace two doors
indicated a cupboard. To the rear, back of this room, was the bedroom
containing a four-poster rope bed covered with somewhat frayed and
none too clean crazy-quilts above gray blankets. Outside, to the left,
and sheltered by the eaves stood the spring-house supplied with the
clearest of mountain water.

Bud’s original idea was merely to sweep, but having done that much he
went a little farther and applied hot water and soap to the floors,
the furniture, and finally to the odds and ends of dishes. This
not only filled in the spare time left from his farm duties, but
it satisfied a newly developed craving. He was not doing this for
himself. He was doing it for Roxie. In a way he was being of service
to her. He was relieving her pretty hands from drudgery. But in so
doing he was submitting to a standard which seemed to him like damned
foolishness--as far as he alone was concerned--and swallowing a goodly
amount of stubborn pride. This involved self-sacrifice. He was doing
it, moreover, for another. This involved a conception of unselfishness.
Bud had never been noted for either quality.

And yet he took a tremendous satisfaction in his efforts. The task
proved so congenial that he carried it far beyond his first intention.
On the second day he mounted his mare in the rain and posted to the
village store. His idea was to buy new oilcloth for the table and a
fresh coffee-pot. Before he was done he had included towels, blankets,
a cake of scented soap, and a supply of tinned goods.

“Looks like you meant to git married,” suggested Ed Bingham, the
storekeeper.

“None o’ yo’ damned business if I am, is it?” frowned Bud.

“No-o,” drawled Bingham with an instant desire to conciliate. “No-o, it
ain’t.”

“Then fergit it,” snapped Bud.

If Ed Bingham found this difficult under the circumstances, he managed
to give his face the proper expression for registering forgetfulness
as long as Bud remained in the store and that sufficed. He had his
opportunity to express as freely as he wished his real opinions
after Bud cantered off. He made the most of that. As far as Bud was
concerned, he might, and be hanged. What was spoken to his face was
one thing; what was spoken behind his back another and relatively
unimportant matter.

Bud returned to his shack through the pouring rain, carefully
protecting his purchases beneath a rubber poncho. Never had he minded
less a wet ride, for the little mare’s hoofs sang him a song all the
way--a simple song with not much variety, but, to his ears, good to
hear. It was merely this:

“Roxie, Roxie, Roxie.”

It ran through his head all the remainder of that day and mixed itself
with his restless dreams. It roused him at dawn and was echoed in the
twitter of the morning birds greeting so joyously the clear sky. He
rose at once with the realization that this morning had a significance
of its own; it was the last he would have to face by himself. To-night
he was to find Roxie and fetch her up here. That made it seem almost
as though she were here now. He washed with considerable attention to
details and slicked down his black hair until it lay plastered to his
head.

Bud was confident. That was characteristic of his attitude towards any
personal venture he undertook alone. It was doubly true of this one
in which he was prepared to risk all in order to gain all. He saw no
obstacles in his path; could conceive of none which might stop him.
His plan was well outlined and simple; he would ride to the Howe shack
after dark and leave his horse in the road just below. Then he would
circle the house and post himself near the kitchen door in the rear.
There he would wait his chance to see Roxie alone. He would not need
over five minutes with her because this time he held all the cards.
When he was done, she would follow him. No fear about that. She might
come like a colt for the first time in halter, but she would come. It
mattered little what her temper was at the start. She would tame.

Towards dusk Bud went through the shack once again and put everything
in order. Then he took out his gun and examined it to make sure each
chamber was loaded. Finally he piled up fresh wood and kindling beside
the fireplace in order to have everything ready for a quick blaze. On
the table he placed a kerosene lamp and matches. At half-past seven he
closed and locked his door and went to the barn for his mare.

It was dark when Bud reached the valley, but he took the rest of the
road on a gallop. There were those who later said they remembered
hearing him pass.

“Thought it must be some one after the doctor,” said one.

Another thought it was some one loaded with moonshine whiskey. All were
glad enough that the mysterious night rider in such a hurry went by
without stopping.

Bud picketed the mare in the woods just off the road, not a hundred
yards from the spot where Allston a few weeks before had been brought
to such an abrupt and unexpected halt. Had Bud been interested he might
have seen the tree still showing the scars made by Allston’s machine.
But that would have been to stir him up unnecessarily.

Bud trusted to the dark to keep him concealed halfway up the serpentine
drive leading to the lighted bungalow, but when within reach of the
light cutting a path over the grass, he swerved to the left and made
a wide half-circle. From this point he worked his way more cautiously
towards the kitchen. The door was open and through it he caught
occasional glimpses of a figure flitting back and forth. It was Roxie.
His heart, had he been blind, would have told him that. The sight
spurred him on--made him resent caution. In another dozen paces he was
at the door.

Roxie felt his presence before she saw him. She was hanging near the
stove her wet dishcloths. Her back was towards him when suddenly she
swung. At sight of him she stood transfixed. In that interval he
crossed the room and seized an arm.

“I gut suthin’ to tell yuh,” he said.

As she shrank away he added in a lower, tenser tone:

“I’m _goneter_ tell yuh suthin’.”

She saw then that in his other hand he held his gun. It made her
afraid--but not for herself.

“What’s the matter, Bud?” she asked aimlessly.

“Come out hyar an’ I’ll tell yuh.”

She grew suddenly cold. She shook as with the ague. Yet she followed
where he led--away from the house across the fields until their voices
could not be heard.

“That pink-cheeked fren’ o’ yourn--I seen him t’other day.”

“Mr. Allston?” she trembled.

“Ef thet’s his name. I seen him in the woods a-makin’ up to Miss
Wilmer.”

Whatever Roxie had expected, it was no such line of attack as this. She
stiffened.

“Yer lie,” she choked.

“I seen him in the cove a-holdin’ her hand,” he went on, quite
undisturbed.

“Yer lie, Bud Childers. Yer lie in your throat,” she panted.

“I swear to Gawd I seen him--a-holdin’ her hand.”

“What was you doin’ there?” she demanded, struggling hard against a new
emotion that gripped her throat like a strangler’s hold.

“What was I doin’ thar?” he repeated slowly. “What was I doin’ thar? I
was passin’ by.”

That was all he said, but from his voice she knew. With a spasmodic
shudder she drew back a step. He followed instantly, bending closer to
her ear.

“I was passin’ by like I’m passin’ by here,” he said. “But I ain’t used
to passin’ by.”

She made no reply. What he said was true. She turned towards the house.
He seized her arm again.

“I left him for Miss Wilmer,” he said hoarsely. “She can have the
damned honey-lapper an’ welcome. But you--I want you myself.”

“Bud,” she pleaded, her breath coming in gasps.

“I want you to-night--now. The mare is waitin’. I’m waitin’. But we
cain’t wait long.”

“What you sayin’?”

“I love yer, Roxie. I’ve fixed the house all up purty fer yer.”

“For me?”

His cheeks were burning with eagerness now. Roughly he pressed closer.

“You talk like we was married!” she exclaimed.

“To-morrer’s time ’nuff for that. But I wanter make sure of you
to-night.”

All the fighting instinct in her flared up--the fighting instinct based
upon her pride of womanhood. Like a fury she turned on the man.

“I’d die afore I went with you, Bud Childers!” she exploded.

“But yo’ll come,” he said. “Yo’ll come.”

“Go ’way! Go ’way!”

“I won’t go away--without’n you. ’Cause if I do--s’help me Gawd I’ll
get yo’ pink-cheeked fren’ fust.”

If the girl had been struck between the eyes, she could have been no
more dazed. A blow would have left her less dazed because then she
might not have been able to think. She could think now. Her thoughts
ran like flames through dry grass. And like wild flames first in this
direction and then that. There was so much in her poor little head that
was inflammable!

Miss Wilmer and the Prince--a-holdin’ hands! It was a lie! Wouldn’t
she have known, living right here with them, if Miss Wilmer or Mr.
Allston--but another burning thought cut in and enveloped this one.
They did not know about her--neither of them--then why should she know
about them? Love might be a hidden thing, like gold in the ground.

It was a lie--and yet something must have held Bud back when he had
this man so at his mercy. It was a lie, and yet not the sort of lie Bud
would make up. Bud could lie on occasion--he had lied that night he
said her mother was sick--but he was not lying now.

Silently the tall, lean figure stood beside her in the dark awaiting
her decision. She turned as though in hope of detecting in him some
slight evidence of weakness. She could not see his face, but that
was not essential. She felt the set of his thin mouth. He was grimly
in earnest. He meant every word he said both about Allston and about
herself. He had spoken of love--of love for her. Here was something to
catch at. If he was honest about that, he could not be all bad.

But before she could reason very far along this line, she heard some
one calling from the house. It was Allston who had come into the
kitchen.

Bud turned in a flash with half-raised gun. Allston stood framed in
the doorway--an easy mark. With a desperate cry Roxie threw herself in
front of Childers.

“I’ll go, Bud,” she whimpered. “I’ll go.”




CHAPTER XIII


Roxie made one request of Bud Childers.

“You’ll let me go back ter the house and git some things, Bud?”

If any one else, under these circumstances, had suggested this, he
would have grown instantly suspicious. Even now he hesitated.

“I--I’ll tell ’um I’m goin’ ter bed an’ then they won’t hunt fer me,”
she added quickly.

“I reckon you’ll come back,” he decided, “’cause ef yo’ don’--”

“I promise,” she whispered.

“I’ll take yer promise,” he said. “Ef you’ll cross yer throat.”

She crossed her throat.

“Then I’ll wait hyar half an hour. Thet long nuff?”

There was a trace of consideration in the question.

“Yes, Bud,” she answered.

She flew across the grass as Allston called again. She came to the
house quite out of breath.

“Where in the world have you been?” demanded Allston.

“Jest out in the field,” she answered.

“Queer,” he muttered. “I was sitting there by the fire and all of a
sudden I got worried about you. Star-gazing?”

She moved away from the open door and closed it. But there were two
windows through which they could be seen.

“I’m all done hyar,” she said. “Guess I’ll blow out the light.”

She waited for him to go back to the sitting-room. He did not move.

“I’m all done hyar,” she repeated.

“Well?”

“I’m goin’ ter blow out the light now.”

“Then blow it out.”

She crossed to the table and blew down the chimney. It was necessary to
blow twice. Then she made for the stairs that opened from the kitchen
to the rear room she occupied.

“Roxie,” he called in the dark.

“I’m all done hyar. I’m goin’ ter bed now,” she answered.

“Just a minute.”

She heard his feet moving towards her and would have run had she dared.
But to do so would only excite suspicion and that was the one thing
she must avoid. His life, on as small an issue as this, was at stake.
She heard him shuffle nearer and nearer and flattened herself against
the wall.

“Roxie,” he said. “You sure you’re all right?”

“Yes, sir.”

“I don’t believe much in hunches, but--over there I used to have them
and pretty nearly always they were worth following.”

He was at her side now. He put out his hand. It touched her shoulder.

“I had a hunch about you to-night.”

“Ye-es, sir.”

“I didn’t know but what Bud Childers was snooping ’round.”

She did not answer.

“Keep away from him, Roxie. If he bothers you, let me know.”

“I’m goin’ ter bed now,” she repeated.

“All right, little girl. Good-night.”

He dropped his warm hand from her shoulder. She felt as though it must
have left a red mark there.

“Good-night,” she stammered.

He left her side and made his way across the dark room to the door into
the sitting-room. He opened it and in the full light she saw him framed.

It was a lie about Miss Wilmer. Her mouth half opened to call him back.
If she told him everything, of how Bud had come to carry her off and
was waiting out there, he could get his own gun and fight him off.
There was still time. Even now he turned back as though expecting to
hear her voice. Clenching her two fists she closed her lips tight. She
had given her word and crossed her throat and even in a fair fight
there would always be danger.

The door closed behind him. The room was in utter darkness again.
Roxie, her hot eyes filling, fumbled her way up the stairs and into her
attic chamber. She lighted her lamp and began to roll up a few things
into a bundle; stockings, shoes, a nightgown--anything she happened
to see. This gave a definiteness to Bud’s proposal that terrified
her anew. He was going to take her up there before she was married.
To-morrow, he had said, they would go to the minister’s--but what of
to-night? She grew hot and cold. She rose from the bureau drawer in
which she was fumbling and stood upright--an animal about to spring. At
sight of herself in the mirror, she grew flaming red with shame. She
blew out the lamp and, crumbling, knelt by her bed as she did every
night. She said her prayer--the only one she knew:

  “Now I lay me down to sleep,
   I pray the Lord my soul to keep;
   If I should die before I wake,
   I pray the Lord my soul to take.”

She had known this from childhood and it had always brought her
comfort. But it was not adequate for now. In superstitious awe of what
she was doing--half fearing it was blasphemy--she added a line of her
own:

“Lord! Lord, please to let me die afore I wake.”

If at that moment she had felt herself suddenly swooning off into
death, she would not have been greatly surprised. She waited a minute
expectantly, but nothing happened. It was life she must face, not death.

Suddenly--as though in answer to her prayer--she thought of a long,
steel-bladed knife she used in the kitchen. She could take that with
her. It would give her something to fight through this night with. It
would save her until to-morrow, and that was all she asked.

It would save her to herself, but not to the world. She realized that.
No one would believe, with the opportunity for escape she now had, she
went with Bud other than voluntarily. Her mother would not believe;
the Mission would not believe; Miss Wilmer would not believe--because
never, never, never could she tell why she did this thing.

Mr. Allston himself might not believe. He had warned her; had offered
his protection. If, in the face of that, she went, he must think it was
because she chose to go.

“Lord,” she repeated, “dear, good, kind Lord--please to take my soul
right away. I wanter be good, Lord. Please to take it.”

If poignant earnestness can wing a prayer straight to God, that prayer
sped like an arrow. And yet if He heard, He gave no evidence of it.
Roxie breathed on, her white, girlish bosom heaving. The knife would
save her to herself, but not to the others.

Weak-kneed and dazed, she rose to her feet again. Time was passing and
Bud was waiting. She had promised to be back in half an hour and the
period of grace might have passed already. In the grip of a new fear
akin to panic, she re-lighted her lamp. God was going to make her go.

It was curious how easily she swung in her thoughts from God to
Allston. From this point it was upon him that she concentrated. In this
mood she conceived a new idea. It might be that he would have another
of those queer notions he called “hunches” and come up here to see if
she was asleep. She must protect him against that possibility. To throw
him off his guard she must write a note and leave it on her pillow.

She found the stub of a pencil and a bit of paper. She wrote
impulsively and with little thought of what she was writing except the
object to be obtained. Her letters were big and scrawly and many of her
words mis-spelled.

  Deer sir [she wrote]. I’m goin off tonite and not comin back. You
  will no why sum day. I am allrite. Plese dont hunt for me. You have
  been orful good to me an with meny thanks I am your frend

                                                            ROXIE KESTER

If he did not find this to-night some one would find it in the morning.
It would explain to Allston why his hot muffins were not ready. When
Roxie rose from the table she looked all about the room to make sure no
one saw her. As an extra precaution she blew out the light. Then she
pressed the note to her lips over the words “Deer sir,” and kissed them
again and again--wildly, passionately, sobbingly.

A moment later she pawed around in the dark for her half-made-up
bundle, placed it under her arm, and stole down the kitchen stairs.
Every time they creaked she paused and held her breath, though she knew
the half-hour must be almost spent. Reaching the bottom she tiptoed to
the kitchen table and felt around in the drawer until she found her
knife. She concealed this in the bundle.

From the next room came the sound of voices; first Miss Wilmer’s voice;
then Allston’s voice; then Miss Wilmer’s voice, and finally a hearty
laugh from Allston. She closed her eyes as though to shut out the
picture this called up.

“It’s a lie,” she said to herself.

She went on out the door and across the grass. Bud was waiting.
Detaching himself from the dark he hurried forward to meet her.




CHAPTER XIV


Allston talked rather more than usual that evening and he laughed
often. But he was strangely restless. At least a half-dozen times he
rose abruptly from his chair and walked about the room, picking up a
book only to drop it, moving to the window only to turn away, lighting
a cigarette only to toss it into the fire after a few puffs.

For an hour or more Wilmer noted his uneasiness without comment, but
finally laughingly referred to it.

“If you were a woman I’d say you had the fidgets,” she declared.

“No--it isn’t that,” he answered. “My nerves are steady enough.”

“Then why don’t you sit still?”

“I give it up,” he smiled.

“It’s that Bud Childers,” broke in Howe. “He’s getting on my nerves
too.”

Wilmer glanced up and shot a quick question at her father.

“You’ve heard something, then, that you haven’t told me?”

“No,” returned Howe.

“You’ve seen him?”

“No. I’ve neither seen nor heard of him for two or three days. I’d feel
better if I had.”

Wilmer turned to Allston with an uneasy feeling that something was
being concealed by one of the men.

“Nor I,” Allston assured her. “And I don’t expect either to see or hear
of him again. I have a notion his bark is worse than his bite.”

Howe shook his head.

“I’m not so sure of that. Those men nourish a grudge for years. That’s
how feuds are bred.”

“It isn’t Childers who is bothering me,” asserted Allston. “If I were
obliged to describe my restlessness I’d have to turn to the spook world
and I’m not very keen about that sort of thing.”

He sat down again in his chair before the fire, between Howe and his
daughter. The latter studied him a moment with amused interest.

“Somehow you’re not the kind of man I’d suspect of being susceptible to
spirits,” she said.

He had rather avoided her eyes this evening. He had found them
increasingly dangerous. He would have said that in the last few days
they had mellowed and deepened. They were still like pools reflecting
the brown of autumn foliage and he was still tempted to fish in them
for smiles. But he could not forget what he had caught there once.

“Why do you single out me?” he asked.

“Because your feet are so solidly on the ground.”

“I’m of the earth earthy?”

She frowned.

“Please don’t misinterpret.”

“I don’t mean to, but isn’t that what you said?”

She shrugged her pretty shoulders.

“I intended rather a compliment, but if you won’t have it--”

“I’ll accept all the crumbs of that kind you toss me,” he interrupted.

“If you two are beginning another quarrel, I’m going upstairs,”
protested Howe good-naturedly.

He may have dozed a good deal in their company off and on, but it is
surprising what a man of his age can pick up even when half asleep. He
was sure of nothing yet, but his suspicions were aroused and he was not
at all displeased with them. He had never met a young man who with so
little effort had so thoroughly worked his way into his good graces. He
had never met a young man whom he so thoroughly trusted. He proved that
in his willingness to leave Allston so much alone with his daughter. He
had not lived sixty-five years for nothing, and would have been quick
enough to foil any development of this sort of which he did not approve.

As a matter of fact Howe for the last year or two had been more or
less worried about Wilmer’s future. Not financially, for he had means
enough to assure her of independence in that direction. But he did not
believe in that kind of independence for a woman. Marriage to him was
the wholesome and natural estate of womanhood. He had been conscious of
a growing fear that Wilmer was deliberately sacrificing herself to him
in this matter. He had never discussed it with her. It was a difficult
and delicate question to bring up. But he had thought a good deal
about it and could account for her apparent aversion to men in no other
way. In spite of good health he was growing old and in his old age felt
in his life the lack of those tiny baby fingers which so assist down
the incline however gentle the slope. This craving for grandchildren is
a sort of second birth. It is the logical continuation of growth. It
makes for completion.

He could trust Wilmer to be sound in her choice--true to her heart--if
only she would choose. He did not propose either to assist her or to
advise. That would be an impertinence. With this newer generation it
was possible for a father to be impertinent towards his daughter. He
used to resent that where now he only smiled at it. He would not assist
her directly, but whenever it was possible to retire gracefully from
the field where these two were trying each other out, he welcomed the
opportunity--even when he knew it annoyed Wilmer. As now, for example.

It was only nine o’clock when he rose upon the slightest of pretexts,
to go to his room.

“No one is quarreling,” protested Wilmer.

“Call it a disagreement, then,” answered Howe.

“If you’ll stay I’ll read to you.”

Wilmer looked to Allston for support. She received little.

“No,” declared Howe, “I’m really ready for bed.”

With that he made his sturdy way across the room and went upstairs,
Wilmer following him with a candle. When she returned, Allston was over
by the window again staring out into the night. He came back to the
fire as soon as he heard her steps.

“I feel,” he said, “exactly as though I heard some one calling--but so
far off that I can’t identify either the voice or the words. Queer,
isn’t it?”

“The imagination plays strange tricks sometimes.”

“You think that’s all it amounts to?”

“Certainly. What else?”

“I don’t know. I’m always getting back to that fool phrase; I don’t
know.”

“We ought to know--always,” she said.

“I suppose so, but do we?”

“I--”

The phrase was on her own lips but she checked herself.

“Go ahead; finish it,” he insisted with a note of triumph.

“I refuse to be so stupid,” she answered, evidently nettled.

“We may as well be honest with ourselves.”

“As long as we remain sensible,” she finished for him.

“Sensible? I wonder what we mean when we say that?”

“I mean governed by intelligence,” she replied instantly.

“Yes,” he admitted. “That’s a good definition. Only--it does leave out
a whole lot.”

“Nothing worth while,” she insisted dogmatically.

“It leaves out war.”

“Perhaps war isn’t worth while.”

“But there it is. The idea governed a good many million men for five
years. And there wasn’t much intelligence back of it when you think it
over in cold blood.”

“Many were governed by the idea of self-protection and that’s
intelligent.”

“It’s more instinctive. And the instincts--are they intelligent?”

He spoke rather more earnestly. She answered rather more cautiously:

“When properly trained.”

“But when properly trained we shouldn’t have instincts,” he laughed.
“We should have only reason.”

“Well?”

“Having chased our tails we are back where we started.”

“I don’t see it.”

“Then let’s try again. Being sensible leaves out--love.”

She moved her chair a trifle--to turn her face away from him and
towards the flames.

“Doesn’t it?” he asked.

There was one good feature about that objectionable phrase of “I don’t
know” which she was willing enough to admit; it furnished, at least,
a convenient refuge. If ever she had wished to use it, that was now.
Without some such retreat one was forced always to direct answers.

“Perhaps you’re a better authority on love than I,” she parried.

“You’re wrong,” he returned quickly. “I don’t know a thing about it
except that, as far as one can observe, it isn’t always sensible.”

“Your observations have been--extensive?” she queried.

There was a touch of coquetry about her now that enlivened her mouth.
Her profile, he thought, was several years younger than her full
face. The gentle curves that outlined her lips and rounded chin were
at this moment--she had unconsciously relaxed her usual control over
them--those of a girl of eighteen.

Allston leaned towards her, his long arms on his knees.

“My observations cover a period of not more than a week or two,” he
said.

“No?”

“And I can’t make head nor tail out of them.”

“Your deductions may not be at all accurate,” she suggested.

“They are scarcely scientific,” he admitted. “They are based upon a
series of impulses.”

“Impulses are dangerous,” she reminded him.

“And yet they get hold of one,” he said tensely, “like instincts.”

She rose upon the pretext of poking the fire. She rose instinctively--as
one draws back at the approach of a flame. What was tempting her to
reach out her hand and smooth the hair back from his troubled forehead?
It was a little act of tenderness she sometimes indulged in with her
father, but this man was not her father. Nor her brother. Nor bore any
blood relationship with her whatsoever. The tenderness that sought
expression in some definite act like this rather than in words, that
demanded contact, was akin to mother love. Yet there was a difference;
a distinct difference. Mother love is a result, born of the past.
This emotion of hers was a desire urging her towards the future. It
was more complex than mother love and more poignant. It was even less
intelligent.

Yet--she felt like offering a little prayer of thanks--it was her
intellect that enabled her to keep herself in control in this
emergency. And with everything against her. Both her cheeks and her
eyes tried to play her false. Only the heat from the burning logs
before which she stooped saved her from an involuntary confession.
They accounted, after a fashion, for her flushed skin and her excited
eyes--brown still, but shot through and through with dazzling golden
arrows as though some one had suddenly swept aside the autumn branches
which kept them cool and let in the glare of the living sun. Reason,
however, was still on her throne. She could still dictate as she chose
the thoughts to which she would allow audible expression.

The only trouble was that, in contrast with those she concealed, the
spoken thoughts sounded so utterly inane that she would much have
preferred to keep silent. That privilege, however, she could not permit
herself. Silence was far more expressive than speech.

So for another half-hour she rambled on in an effort to keep their
conversation in the placid waters of banality until in desperation she
was forced to seek safety in flight. This at a time when she knew that
as far as her own thoughts went, flight offered no protection; this
also at a time when she felt--uncannily enough--as though some unseen
hand were on her arm urging her not to leave him. She could not account
for that. It served further to confuse her. Doubtless it was merely a
normal reaction to his strange mood. Yet it should not be in the face
of her derision of that mood.

At half-past nine Wilmer excused herself.

“Perhaps a good night’s rest will help your fidgets,” she said to
Allston, as she lighted her candle.

He rose.

“Perhaps,” he admitted. “Though I refuse to call them fidgets.”

Her mind was aggressively acute to-night. She seemed driven to pick up
every phrase and analyze it.

“I wonder if it makes so much difference what we call things,” she
reflected. “People argue over definitions as though it changed the
thing itself.”

“I suppose it’s just another attempt to be honest.”

She shrugged her shoulders.

“Or to avoid the truth--dishonestly.”

“And yet if we spoke the stark truth as it comes to us, wouldn’t we
make mistakes?”

Again the warning flame across her cheeks.

“Oh, it’s possible to keep on forever getting nowhere,” she exclaimed.

“And you’re tired,” he said anxiously.

“Good-night,” she answered simply.

She was about to turn away when he extended his hand.

“Good-night,” he said with a wistful plea in his voice.

She hesitated a moment and then placed her own warm fingers within his
broad palm. But only for a second. He had no time to close over them.

“Good-night,” she whispered, and hurried up the stairs leading from the
open room to the floor above.

He watched her until she disappeared--the flash of her pretty ankle the
last glimpse he had of her.




CHAPTER XV


Allston blew out the big lamp on the table and sank down in a chair
before the open fire. He was tired neither physically nor mentally. And
yet in some ways he was glad to be alone. For the last few hours he had
been under a nervous strain in Wilmer’s presence. He was like a man in
a closed room with many doors trying to feel his way out through one
opening and then another, discovering that some of the doors gave a
little way and others not at all, in the end to be left exactly where
he started. Further, to complicate matters, that thin voice in the dark
outside still called to him. He heard it even now above the rustling
and creaking and eerie moan of a rising wind beating against the house,
presage of a storm.

It was extraordinary to him that such a situation could have developed
out of such innocuous material. The whole adventure had begun so lazily
and drowsily! Half asleep at the wheel of his wheezy gray runabout he
had been keeping to twenty miles an hour over a country road that
seemed as though it might end at any time in primeval forest. It was
just the setting he had sought for that complete relaxation which was
to allow his mind, muddied by two years of war, to settle into the
placid pool it always had been. So it had seemed about to do when Roxie
Kester appeared in the road and forced his head-on collision with a
chestnut-oak. But that seemed merely like a temporary interruption. The
kindness of the Howes offered him just as good an opportunity to bask
in the sun as did the open road. This was a golden land dripping with
milk and honey where a man need not keep his eyes more than half open.
It was a country of blue sky and birds and shocked wheat and flowers
and people at their ease.

It still was. If he could only get hold of that idea and keep it, he
might find that the present crisis which appeared so acute was merely
a morbid mental condition unwarranted by fact. He was only a guest in
passing. He had distorted his values. This was only a bypath incident
not to be taken too seriously. The main road of his life lay in another
direction, though where only the Lord knew. Somehow it must be related
to the past he had already lived, and must develope out of those
surroundings with which he was already familiar.

Yet it was not easy to think of any future which should eliminate this
girl who had just left him. He had known women twenty years, neighbors
at home, whom he could banish with less difficulty. He had seen them
with his eyes alone. He had never made them part of his thoughts--of
his deeper thoughts. And they had never made him question himself. Nor
had they ever made him feel.

It was at this point that he found himself most baffled in his
relations with Wilmer. She made him think, but she parried every
thought. She made him feel, but she checked every expression of that
emotion. There were moments when he felt he could break through that
reserve, but he never quite dared to try after his one attempt. Then,
too, he was held in check by the conditions under which he was a guest
here. Unvouched for, he was under even deeper obligations to his host
than one accepted under the conventions. He was in honor bound not to
violate the trust imposed upon him. He could advance no farther than
he was asked. And Wilmer was not always easy to interpret.

To-night he was more bewildered by her than ever. The net result of
this evening had been to increase the tension between them while
leaving everything at loose ends. He could not fairly blame her alone
for that, however, while he was ragged in his own thinking. It began
to look as though this clarifying process which had appeared so
simple during the first few days of his flight from home was becoming
decidedly complicated. If he had succeeded in clearing his mind of one
kind of jumble, that of troop trains and transports, and the braggart
tyranny of superior officers, it was only to fill it with another kind
dominated by quite as autocratic a type of tyranny. It seemed that a
woman’s eyes could, in their way, bully as effectively as any uniformed
overlord with his jingling spurs.

Allston began to pace the floor again. The wind was increasing in
volume and driving scattered raindrops against the windows with the
velocity of bullets. An occasional flash of lightning cut a blazing
path through the dark like star shells, though the light was not held.
And from a distance, beyond the mountains, he heard the low rumble of
thunder so like the heavy guns that used to growl through the night
over Flanders that at moments it was difficult for him not to believe
he was back there again. This might have been one of those deserted
houses in that old French town in which he had been billeted except
that it lacked the marks of age. But it is the mood that counts in a
picture; not the details. The Huns were attacking over Green Mountain
and he was here to do his little part to drive them back. Barbarism was
in a new clash with civilization. He felt this so keenly that his hand
as another star shell burst went back to his automatic. And then came
the voice again.

This time it was more individualized. It sounded like the voice of
Roxie Kester. That was absurd, of course, but the notion gave him a
start. The girl had acted strangely when she came back to the kitchen
from across the fields. It was queer that she had been out there at all
except that young women were subject to odd spells of that sort. He had
not been satisfied when he left her and might have been considerably
worried had not other matters come in to occupy his attention.

Allston tiptoed through the kitchen and outdoors to see if her light
was burning. Her window was dark. The wind whipped his face and drove
him in. Still he was not satisfied. Action whetted his fears. It became
necessary now, if he hoped to get any rest, to allay his anxiety once
for all. Striking a match he made his way up the stairs to the door of
Roxie’s room. It was closed, but he listened there for sound of her
breathing. He heard nothing, but that proved nothing. Reluctantly and
not at all sure of the explanation of his action he could give if she
did answer, he knocked. He received no reply and knocked again--louder
this time. But even so he was held back by his dread of rousing the
rest of the household. It would be easier, should his alarm prove
groundless, to explain his conduct to Roxie than to either Howe or
Wilmer.

The continued silence became ominous and oppressive. He was finding it
difficult to breathe as though the hall were being exhausted of air.
Cautiously he turned the handle and pushed. The door opened, but the
room was in utter darkness.

He whispered her name:

“Roxie.”

Then:

“Are you there, Roxie?”

Silence now gave him a direct answer. He struck a match and held it
above his head. The bureau drawers were open and one shoe stood in the
middle of the room. The white bed was empty and undisturbed. On the
table he saw a lamp and lighted this. Then he caught sight of the note
on the pillow. The fact it was addressed to him was significant. Under
ordinary circumstances she would have written to Wilmer. As he read,
every word justified his suspicions. But at the sentence, “Please don’t
hunt for me,” he saw as clear as daylight the hand of Bud Childers in
the affair.

The note dropped from Allston’s nervous fingers to the floor. He did
not pick it up. He knew every word by heart. For two hours she had been
calling to him and he had not answered.

But why, if in danger, had she not called upon him when he sought her
after dinner and offered his aid? The note answered that. She was
trying to protect him. In some way, by some ruse, Bud had bullied her
into following him and she had deliberately sacrificed her one chance
of escape. The inevitable deduction swept Allston back to that night
at the bend in the road when she stood before him with her head tilted
back and her eyes closed. In her white dress silvered with moonlight
she had made a romantic figure. She was like some gentle creature sung
of in idyls. A man might well pray to be saved from such a temptation
as she offered him then. He had not been insensible, though, thank God,
he had held steady. It had for him been but a passing moment, but for
her it had meant more. He saw it now--fool that he had been. He saw it
now when it was possibly too late.

There was one chance in a hundred that Roxie had gone home. After that
the chances were a hundred to one that she had gone with Bud Childers.
It was now ten o’clock. Within two hours he would know.

Allston had not been so coolly sure of himself since he stepped out of
uniform. His face hardened and something of that merciless tint of blue
steel took the place in his eyes of their natural color. His thoughts
clicked into place like cartridges in a machine gun. All the qualities
that military discipline had trained into him reasserted themselves
with automatic precision. He moved quickly and without hesitancy.

Crossing the room he extinguished the lamp and came out, closing the
door behind him. There was no need of rousing the others. They had much
better sleep on. He meant to have the girl back here before morning,
and in that case there was no reason why they should ever be disturbed
by knowledge of the episode.

He came downstairs and went to his room for a coat and hat. Here
he stopped to examine his revolver and to slip into his pocket the
remainder of his cartridges. He found about a dozen. He closed his
own door, returned to the sitting-room to make sure the fire was safe
there, and hurried out.

It was pitch dark--inky dark. The wind was still blowing and the rain
increasing in volume. He bent against it as he took the road to Roxie’s
house he had followed before. It was pitiful that he should be obliged
to waste the time necessary to eliminate that faint possibility, but
it was essential. Before he ventured to force himself into Childers’s
shack he must be certain of his facts. That was too grim a business to
undertake except upon firm ground.

His progress was slow and labored. The road was rough, and he
frequently found himself out of it and floundering among the bushes.
Always there was the temptation to quicken his pace and always he
resisted that. He must take no chances of spraining an ankle. And he
must keep plenty of strength in reserve. He had seen too much of the
reckless folly of advancing to a point farther than support warranted.
He had watched whole regiments wiped out as they occupied their forward
positions with spent strength, the helpless victims of fresh attacking
troops. He must not be exhausted when he finally reached the home of
Bud Childers.

Not that he anticipated any such weakness. He had learned that, given
the occasion, one’s resources are well-nigh inexhaustible. Again and
again in France he had found himself just beginning to draw on his
strength at the point where in civil life he would have been ready to
quit. And never had he been dominated by so inflexible a will as now.
Duty and patriotism will carry a man far, but such a call as this which
now urged him on will carry a man even farther. Here was Duty linked,
not with an abstract idea, but with the most concrete appeal a man can
know--that of a woman in need of his strength.

As Allston fought his way on, as he pitted his might against the
obstacles in his path, Roxie became still more clearly outlined. He
thought of her less as a child. This startled him at first. It left him
uneasy. It was better, in some ways, to think of her as a child.

But this thing she had done for him--if his deductions were
correct--was the act of a woman. And such a woman! Unreasonable and
unwarranted it was! Unjustified and uncalled-for it was! But also it
was magnificent!

This much Allston appreciated and responded to with a thrill. And yet
even so he had not begun to plumb the depths of her intense little
being. He interpreted her act as one of heroic self-sacrifice based
upon an exaggerated sense of gratitude for the protection he had given
her. That was enough, God knows, to spur him on, but it left out, too,
so much--so much.

The windows of the Kester house were dark when he reached there. That
told him nothing. He pounded at the door without response and that told
him more. Roxie would not have been as difficult as this to rouse.
With his worst fears revived, he kicked at the wooden panels as the
rain beat down upon him. The passing minutes were becoming of more and
more value. He tried the latch and shook it impatiently when he heard
shuffling footsteps within. A voice called to him--the voice of an old
and timid woman.

“Who’s thet?” she demanded.

He answered with a question.

“Is Roxie there?”

“Roxie hyar? No, Roxie ain’t hyar. She’s up to Miss Wilmer’s. Who be
you-all?”

Allston had already taken a step back. The wind tore his reply to
shreds. He must make the mountain road now as fast as the night would
let him--remembering always to keep plenty of strength in reserve.

One thing helped him; the afternoon he had returned from that little
cove on the mountain-side Howe had questioned him as to where he had
been. As he told, Howe clapped a hand upon his shoulder.

“Big Laurel is up there. Keep away,” he warned.

“Why?”

“You must have been within a few hundred yards of Childers’s shack.”

It was not that fact which left so vivid an impression in Allston’s
mind, but what he had thought while walking by the side of Wilmer. He
was glad enough now, however, that it served to place him. He could
have returned to that cove with his eyes shut.

Against a background of storm-rent clouds and the formidable bulk of
mountains and a sea of tossing trees, a man is but a tiny object. With
the night and the winds and the beating rain against him, it would
seem that he would count for no more than a dead leaf. And yet ever
since man was man and not merely some grubbing insect, the elements
have spent their fury against him in vain. Again and again on the
ocean and on the desert, in the frozen North and the tropic South, on
mountain-top and plain, man has faced their worst and often enough
survived. If at times he is pitifully easy to kill, at other times he
is unconquerable.

Yard by yard Allston fought his way along the mountain road that
follows the slope of the hills and past the Lutheran church which gave
him his bearings. With the creek on his right he stumbled through a
heavy growth of hemlocks, passing several shacks in darkness. Each time
he mastered the temptation to rouse the occupants and inquire his way.
To do this would be possibly to reveal his business--would inevitably
reveal his presence in the neighborhood--and that seemed unwise. These
people were certain to be more friendly to Bud than to himself. In the
end he might be obliged to take that risk, but he knew that Bud’s shack
opened somewhere from this road into a clearing, and he felt sure that
however late the hour he would find it lighted. If he knew Roxie there
would be little sleep for Bud that night. Whatever club the bully held
over her head to make her follow would not be effective enough to cow
her utterly. If left alone Bud might win in the end, but he would have
a fight on his hands that could not be settled in a few hours.

That was a fair argument, and yet with every passing minute Allston
felt the strain of the delay. She might not be conquered, but she
must be suffering. And for every second of pain he was responsible.
Unwittingly she had placed him in a position where this could not be
otherwise.

So for another ten minutes he floundered on, and then, to the right and
ahead, he caught through the trees--flashing on and off as the waving
branches passed before it--a yellow gleam. He pressed on faster and
nearer. A sharp turn brought him to the log which crossed the creek to
the clearing before the shack. Cautiously he moved over this. The light
from the uncurtained window did not carry far and the rain dripping
down the panes obscured his sight of the room within. He paused now, a
little out of breath. It was not easy to wait when so near, but this
was no easy task he had before him. A single careless move might end
for all time his usefulness.

He had once read somewhere that there is no such thing as an accident;
that every mishap can be traced directly to some one’s mistake. He had
always remembered that. It had served him in good stead in the war. It
helped him to a cool judgment that cut down his own mistakes.

When he moved a few steps nearer the window, he was in complete command
of himself. The driving rain was to his advantage. It made it easier
to look in than to look out. With his automatic in his hand he crept
to within a few feet of the shack, and standing a little to one side
of the window peered in. What he saw made it very difficult for him to
breathe normally.




CHAPTER XVI


Allston, from where he stood outside the shack, had Childers within
range, and as he saw the big fellow standing before the shrinking
figure of Roxie, he was tempted to shoot. He was restrained by his
unwillingness at this point to kill and by fear of the consequences, if
he attempted merely to cripple the man, that might follow to the girl
before he could reach her side. He must be patient a few moments longer
and if possible get inside the house. Only then could he secure the
drop on Bud.

Allston knew nothing of the floor plan of the shack, but he saw a door
leading from the main room to the left of the fireplace and so supposed
there must be another entrance in the rear. If not he might find an
unfastened window. In this reconnoitering, the tempest which had until
now opposed him changed its colors and assisted. He could move freely
without danger of being overheard. Circling to the left he went around
the spring-house. But now he no longer had the help of the lamp within.
He had to feel his way, following the house as a blind man does. He
came to a darkened window--the kitchen window--passed it and so reached
the frame of a door. His fingers felt their way across this to a latch
which rattled as he touched it. He could thank the wind once more for
disarming suspicion at such unusual noises. All the evening long it,
too, had been fumbling at this latch.

But Allston knew that once he opened this door the wind would follow
him in and rushing ahead announce a visitor. This would give Bud the
time he needed to seize his gun. And that in turn meant shooting to
the death without either explanation or argument. This Allston wished
to avoid, if possible. Bully and brute the man might be, but he was
entitled to a hearing; bully and brute the man might be, but Allston
preferred that some one other than himself should administer that kind
of grim justice. He himself had no desire to kill. His concern was
with Roxie rather than Bud. He was perfectly willing to give the man a
mauling if opportunity offered, but his chief business was to rescue
the girl.

Allston had noted that to the right of this outside door and just
inside there was another room. With that in mind a plan of action
suggested itself which would make that eager wind at his back serve
instead of foil him. If he swung the outer door wide and stepped in
quickly, he could shove open this inner door and hide himself in that
room. The wind hurrying ahead would summon Bud, who, the chances were,
would think the storm had beaten open the door. Allston then might have
his chance at the man as he passed. If not, he would still have the
advantage of being inside the house. He would retain that advantage
even if Bud started a search. For Bud to find him must hold a light.

Allston acted promptly--the one gamble he was taking being that
the door was locked. Gently he pressed the latch and shoved. The
door opened and the storm swept down the narrow hall to the lighted
living-room beyond. Allston stepped noiselessly into the right-hand
room, keeping as near the sill as was safe. He heard an oath from Bud
and then silence.

Childers was waiting to see what, if anything, followed the opening
of that door. Nothing followed but wind-laden rain that made the lamp
flicker. The hall was only feebly lighted, but when Bud cautiously
ventured to look the length of it he saw enough to be assured that it
was empty. And so, quite off his guard, he strode down to close the
door. This time he shoved the bolt that locked it.

It was while he was at this task, both hands occupied, that Allston
sprang. He brought the butt of his automatic down hard just over the
man’s temple. Bud staggered and Allston threw his full weight upon
him bearing him to the floor. At the same time he found the fellow’s
throat. For a moment Allston held on, but Bud was quite still. In
falling he had struck his head hard enough to knock him out.

From the next room Allston heard the moaning cries of the girl. He
called her.

“Roxie!”

The crying ceased instantly, but he received no reply.

“Roxie, come here.”

She came on a run then. She saw Allston still full length upon the man.

“Find me a rope,” he ordered.

“Mister Allston!”

“Quick!”

She vanished to reappear a few seconds later with a piece of stout
cord. Allston turned the fellow over and bound together his two wrists
with the army hitch designed for just this purpose. Roxie watched,
dazed and breathless with both fear and blind joy.

“Now bring the lamp,” he commanded.

As long as Allston issued orders to her she could act. If only he would
continue--indefinitely. That was all she asked for, just the privilege
of obeying.

When she returned, Allston stooped and examined the man’s wounds. There
were two ugly gashes, one over the temple and one in the blue-black
hair. Allston sent for water and when she brought it sopped his
handkerchief in it and washed away the blood which had trickled over
Childers’s face. Both wounds he discovered to be superficial. He
cleaned them as best he could and felt Bud’s pulse. It was steady.
In fact, before he was through with his examination and first-aid
treatment the man had begun to revive. His eyes flickered open and he
tried to make his feet. That was not easy with tied hands and became
further complicated as Allston promptly sat on his legs.

“Steady there,” he warned. “You’re going to stay put for a while.”

Bud experienced difficulty at first in understanding the situation.
This was like some evil dream. He twisted and writhed for a moment and
then settled back to the inevitable. His lips twitched, but he did not
speak.

“Now, Roxie,” said Allston, “we must find more rope. Look around, will
you?”

“You--you gotter watch him,” she panted.

“I’ll watch him, but I can’t spend the rest of the evening on his legs.
It’s late and--we’ve a long way to go.”

She brought an old leather halter-strap. This served well enough,
though Allston could not fasten it as tight as he wished. However,
it made it safe to leave the man and he was beginning to feel the
cold. First, however, he took the precaution to remove Bud’s gun--a
villainous-looking Colt big enough to bore a hole the size of a walnut.

“Better stay quiet,” warned Allston. “If I hear you moving I’ll find
more rope. Get that?”

Bud’s level eyes, hard as dagger blades, met those of steel blue before
him. He deigned no reply. His face was as immobile as though cut from
granite.

Allston picked up the lamp and led the way into the next room. He
tossed a log on the open fire and removed his wet coat, Roxie watching
him in silence and awe. He warmed his numb hands over the blaze,
surveying the room in detail as he did so. It was cleaner than he had
expected and more attractive. With the cold wind rattling the windows,
hopelessly, and the rougher features of the surroundings subdued by
shadows, with the warmth of the wood flames tingling pleasantly on
his skin, he reacted quickly from the ugly incidents of the last few
minutes. What, a short time ago, had seemed so grave a problem was now
no problem at all. The moment he felt Roxie to be safe and sound, as
obviously she was with Bud eliminated, he was rather inclined to accept
the whole situation with easy good humor. He turned to Roxie with a
smile. She was standing back against the wall--as far back as she
could get. She was wearing no hat and her hair had become loosened, a
detached strand hanging over one temple and another over her forehead.
With a quick movement and in some embarrassment as she saw him looking
at her, she swept these back into place.

To Allston she was just a child again. He sank into a chair with his
wet, muddy boots thrust towards the flames.

“Roxie,” he said, “you certainly arranged a real hike for me to-night.”

She was silent a moment and then she broke out:

“What fer--did you come?”

“To take you home,” he answered easily.

“Who asked ye?” she demanded.

“_You_ did.”

“You lie!”

She spoke without thinking. The phrase sounded harsher than she
intended. She meant only to deny.

Allston turned in his chair to face her.

“Come over here by the fire.”

“I don’ wanter.”

He rose.

“Then I’ll have to come to you, but I wanted to dry my feet.”

At that she ran to his side.

“Please,” she begged, “yer boots is all muddy an’ wet.”

As he sat down again willingly enough, for his legs really were heavy
and his feet bruised, she knelt by his chair, and before he realized
what she was doing began to unlace his shoes. As she did so her voice
fell into a low crooning.

“Po’ feet,” she murmured. “They’s all wet an’ hurt--they’s all wet an’
hurt. Oh, I didn’ know you’d come. I didn’ know. It’s all my fault.”

Her fingers were fumbling at the strings--her bent head by his knee. He
placed his hand upon her silky flaxen hair.

“Roxie,” he protested, “don’t do that.”

“Yer’ll ketch yo’ death o’ cold. An’ it’ll be all my fault.”

“Get up, child.”

“They’re mos’ done now.”

It was true enough. She had them off before he could object further and
had placed them on the hearth.

“You’d spoil any man, Roxie,” he smiled.

“I never done thet fer no man afore,” she answered.

“And you shouldn’t again.”

“I’d do it fer you ag’in.”

“I shan’t ever let you.”

“Then what fer did ye come?” she cried.

“To fetch you home.”

“Back to Miss Wilmer’s?”

“Certainly.”

He was a bit puzzled by her questioning. He did not know where it
was leading, but he had an uncomfortable feeling that it was leading
somewhere it should not.

“I ain’t a-goin’ back to Miss Wilmer’s,” she answered with tightened
lips.

“Of course you are,” he insisted with a trace of irritation.

“Who’s a-goin’ to make me?” she challenged.

“Make you? No one. You’re going because it’s the place for you to go;
because you want to go.”

“I don’t.”

“Look here, Roxie--”

“I don’t,” she repeated, with a sharp stamp of her foot. “An’ ef you
wanter go an’ hold her hand some more you kin go.”

The last part of her speech was a wild, unconstrained outburst. A
moment ago she would have choked herself before she would have allowed
it to escape her lips. Even now she stood back aghast, though still
aggressive.

“Good Lord!” exclaimed Allston, his eyes held to her by the intensity
of her passion.

As he started to rise she sank down in a heap, her legs weak beneath
her. Leaning forward she buried her face in her hands. Allston retained
his seat. He did not dare move; did not dare touch her. He was confused
and uncertain.

“Who’s been talking to you, Roxie?” he frowned.

“Bud--he seen,” she choked.

“Saw what?”

“Seen you a-holdin’ of Miss Wilmer’s hand down to the cove.”

Suddenly she lifted her wet face to his.

“Unless he lied,” she trembled. “Mebbe he lied. I tol’ him he lied.”

Allston caught his breath. Bud must have been in the bushes. With a
chance like that, why hadn’t the fellow shot?

“Mebbe he lied,” she said again, her face eager with new hope.

“But if he didn’t?”

“I won’t never go down ter Miss Wilmer’s ag’in,” she choked.




CHAPTER XVII


In the dark hall, bound hand and foot, Bud Childers lay flat on his
back staring into Hell. In the old days of the Spanish Inquisition
devilish minds spent days of thought in devising new tortures by which
to bring with a nice appreciation of every fine point fresh torments
to individual cases. The infliction of pain was a profession. But even
these fanatical experts could have contrived nothing better adapted to
the especial requirements of Childers than this which Allston--wholly
without that object in mind--had hit upon.

Bud’s very soul was seared by the realization of how he had been
foiled, outwitted, and manhandled by this pink-cheeked stranger--this
honey-lapping interloper--this lily-fingered rival. The fellow had
thrown and tethered him as though he were a yearling steer. And he had
done this in Bud’s own home--in his own inviolable cove. Allston had
kicked him one side like a yellow dog within the sacred precincts of
his own shack and left him like a crippled pup in the dark. And Roxie
had been a witness of this ignominy.

But that was not all. That was enough to make a man writhe like a
salted worm, but it was not all. Allston was still here. He was
occupying Bud’s own living-room. He was sitting in one of Bud’s chairs.
He was warming himself before Bud’s fire. And this with Bud’s own woman
aiding and abetting.

Gawd A’mighty! Gawd A’mighty!

As the full meaning of it all burned into his brain, Bud found it as
difficult to breathe as though he were being strangled. He could hear
their voices from the next room, though he could not make out their
words. That was worse. It left him free to imagine. They were talking
about him and laughing.

Gawd A’mighty!

Bud strained at the ropes binding his hands--strained until the cords
bit into his flesh. He tested his strong legs against the ankle straps
until his muscles cramped into knots. He turned his head this way and
that, his mouth open like a snapping dog, until the sweat stood out
upon his thin forehead in great beads. It ran down into his narrowed
eyes, burning them with salt.

Here in his own shack! Here where for three generations no man had
dared tread without being asked! Here in these rooms he had made ready
for Roxie--she who on the morrow was to have been his bride! The
egg-eyed hornyhead!

He was breathing like a man who has run a mile. His big hairy
chest--made deep by so many trips up and down the mountain--heaved
spasmodically. It was well his heart was strong--else something might
have snapped. It was carrying a heavy load. As it was there were
moments when those thin lips covering that iron jaw grew first purple
and then white.

He could hear their voices and hear their feet when they moved. If
Allston had only come out here occasionally and kicked him, he could
have stood it better. But the man ignored him as though he were not
there. They talked on and for all he knew held hands--in the room
where the sprig of laurel stood in a bottle on the table: on the table
covered with new oilcloth which he had ridden to the village to buy for
her. This man was treading with his dirty feet the floor Bud had got
down on his knees to clean for Roxie. And she was in there beside him.

Bud lay passive for a few minutes. The cold wind slithered in beneath
the door and marked him as with a knife-blade where it touched his
skin. It played with his disheveled black hair. It worried, like a
playful pup, the bottom edges of his trousers and his ankles. It
maddened him like something alive bent upon teasing. He kicked out at
it with both tied feet.

And the man who had done all this was the man he had allowed to go
when he had drawn a sure bead on his heart that day in the cove. What
a cussed fool he had been not to put an end to him then and there!
God give him one more such chance--just one more! God give him half a
chance--just a fighting chance! With a gun or a knife or with his naked
fists. He had not fought with his hands since he was a boy, but now he
felt the instincts of a mountain cat. He craved to claw and to tear. He
ached to bite with his yellow teeth as animals bite.

Again he tested his strength until the muscles in his throat stood out
like whipcords. He could not understand why the rope did not break.
With the strength now latent in him he felt that he could snap iron
chains. It was maddening. When finally he sank back once again limp
after his effort, he felt a choking sensation in his throat like that
which comes to small boys helpless in their rage. Something akin to
tears moistened his hard blue eyes. To offset this, he voiced an ugly
oath below his breath.

He flopped over on his side to relieve the weight of his body on his
hands. There was humiliation in that act itself. It gave him the effect
of groveling. He had seen dogs, belly to the ground, crawl along like
that, and it always filled him with contempt. He felt the same contempt
for himself. But quickly following every such emotion came his black
rage against Allston--the man who forced upon him each additional
torment.

Gawd A’mighty!

But all this while Bud spoke never a word out loud. There were moments
when he could have shrieked in rage; there were other moments when wild
oaths sought expression. But every time so tempted he brought his thin
lips tight over his teeth. Had Allston himself come out here, he would
have been met with stolid silence. Speech to Bud, when highly moved,
expressed nothing. It was too utterly inadequate. His emotions drove
him to stolidness--to the stoicism of the Indian.

At the end of ten minutes Bud had spent in unavailing struggle the
first mad onrush of his blind rage. By brute force he had failed to
accomplish anything except to lacerate his flesh. He accepted this fact
as a fresh humiliation. He had pride in his physical strength. The
deepest satisfaction he could have had at the moment would have been to
burst these bonds Allston had fastened upon him.

Exhausted mentally and physically, he lay quiet for a moment. Passive,
he found himself able to think more clearly. It was barely possible
that what could not be accomplished in one way might be in another. A
rat was a small animal, and yet by industry and patience he generally
managed to secure his ends. Bud had seen them by constant gnawing eat
their way through oak beams that would have foiled the strength of a
bear. A rope was made up of many fine strands. If a man could break
them one by one, it was only a question of time when he would have them
all severed.

Bud squirmed his long fingers tipped with hard nails until they reached
the hempen cords. Then he began to scratch against them--slowly,
laboriously, painfully. It was a tedious process. But the rope was old.
He could feel the outer strands fuzz up as he continued. He could also
feel the calloused tips of his fingers quicken as the skin wore away.
It was a question which would last the longer. It was a question how
much time he had, anyway. But with those voices coming to him from the
next room he must be doing something. And one can never tell.

Gawd A’mighty, if he should get free--!




CHAPTER XVIII


Roxie Kester had ridden up here this evening sitting behind Bud and
holding to the man’s big shoulders to keep from falling. Bud had kept
the mare to a walk and they had journeyed in silence. She had not
been afraid. This was not altogether because of her reliance on the
long-bladed kitchen knife which she had slipped from her bundle and
hidden in her bosom, although this had helped to steady her. But the
deeper reason was that even on that long wild ride she had thought less
of herself than of some one else. She had eliminated herself--as far as
her future was concerned--the moment she left the house and joined this
other. She had made her decision. She had made her sacrifice. Twice her
Prince had risked his life for her and now she was risking her own for
him. She was doing even more. There was a certainty here. A man may
clash with another man--may clash even with a chestnut-oak--and escape.
He is risking only his life. But a woman may not place herself in such
a position as she was now in and avoid the consequences. However she
protected herself until morning, it made the next step inevitable.
Not to marry Bud the next day would be to stand disgraced. The only
explanation she could give that would justify her conduct, she must
not give. The toothless old gossips would roll the story around their
tongues like snuff. A girl does not spend the night in a mountain shack
unless she chooses.

Yet Roxie was neither afraid nor depressed. She was in a state of
exaltation paralleled only by religious ecstasy. Love--such romantic
love as hers--is heroic. Heroism is nothing but complete and utter
unselfishness. Her joy came in giving, not in asking. If she could not
give herself to him she would give herself for him.

The wonder is not that the young are inspired to such idealistic
heights; the wonder comes to the old and sophisticated. Men and women
are born poets--women more often than men. And poets are a simple
people living outside themselves, in touch with the singing stars. Only
as they turn wise and think of themselves do they grow blunt and blind
and are forced to grope their way on the surface of the earth.

Roxie could allow her thoughts to wander at will on that ride up the
mountain-side. She could permit them to take flight where they would.
She had given all that she had to give and so was entitled to take all
that remained for her to take. There was no need of repressions. She
had won the complete freedom that only love can give.

So she thought of Allston as she chose--calling him Ned as in her very
secret heart she had long called him. Aye, she could kiss his hair now
and his white forehead and his lips. Throwing back her head, the rain
beat down upon her face and each drop was like a kiss back from him.
There were thousands of them, but not too many. How her heart leaped at
the thought! How it sang! A thousand, ten thousand were not enough to
satisfy her hungry heart.

A man may carry a lady off on horseback without carrying her heart at
all. A man may take a lady into the black forest and have none of the
best of her. A man may shut a lady up in the fastness of his shack and
wonder what has become of her.

Bud dimly realized that much an hour later. It did not discourage him,
but it puzzled him. He had looked for protest and outcry and he was
met by an uncanny silence. Once, when he tried to take her hand, he
was warned off, but even then so quietly that he was dazed. At the end
of another hour he was staring at her with a new eagerness and growing
passion that might have made him dangerous--when the back door had
swung open admitting the tempest.

The presence of Ned Allston was in reality fraught with more tragic
consequences to Roxie than to Childers. The latter had been thrown and
tied, and that was the end of him. But Roxie had been set free--and
that was not the end of her. She had been released from the end. She
was forced to face a new fight--a fight made more intense by the leeway
she had so recently given herself. It is one thing to stay within
bounds and another to move out of bounds and return again.

Allston in the last few hours had become more distinctly personal to
her than before. He had stepped into reality: so much so that when he
stood before her in the flesh she was half ashamed to face him. She
remembered the rain and her upturned mouth. It was because of that she
had allowed herself to speak of Wilmer.

He had not denied the story Bud had told of what he saw in the cove.
Then it was true. She was sitting on the floor, Turk fashion, and
Allston was still in his chair studying her with his puzzled blue eyes.
To herself she repeated over and over again the question she had asked
of him, “What fer had he come?”

All he was doing now was to take away her dreams--the one thing that
had saved her. He was not changing other conditions in the slightest.
He was making them even worse. Did he think she wanted to go back to
Miss Wilmer’s and watch him hold her hand?

She felt the venomous sting of a new emotion--of jealousy. The poison
works swiftly in such natures as hers.

In the meanwhile Allston had come to some realization of the problem
he faced. Another man might have been quicker, but another man would
not have been Allston. That the girl had her romantic moments he was
aware--every one, man or woman, has those; but that she had carried
them as far as this he had never suspected. His mind had been far too
occupied in another direction. Even on his way up here when, under the
stress of the struggle, he had sensed something of the significance of
her act and that in a way it involved him, he had not associated it
with love. Rather had it seemed like a magnificently impersonal poetic
idea. For two years, in France, he had been in touch often with just
this sort of thing. Again and again he had seen it govern the fine acts
of men and women--of young men and women. Under the spell of it he had
seen them make sacrifices that staggered the imagination. Sometimes it
was in the name of country; sometimes in the name of duty; sometimes in
the name of honor; sometimes in the name of gratitude--but always it
was utterly impersonal.

To him Roxie from the beginning had seemed of this type. She reminded
him in many ways of those extraordinary young peasant women with whom
he had come into such fleeting contact--the women with the liquid black
eyes so quick to respond to elemental emotions, but so steady withal
as one saw them in their mothers and grandmothers. Somehow Allston had
always understood them enough to respect them, which could not be said
of some of his fellow officers. He had glimpsed the finer stuff that
lay below the tempting smiles, and understood, too, something of the
abnormal conditions under which they were living.

Roxie had been just such another, though under no such tension. She
was as good to look upon as a mountain flower. She possessed much of
the same natural beauty and many of the same natural imperfections.
And she fitted well into her own surroundings, appearing best in the
woods, under sun or moon. She was at her best here to-night in this
mountain shack where the wind and the rain were more companions than
enemies. In the glow of the firelight her hair shone like spun gold,
and her skin, tanned and even freckled in places, was as beautiful as
the spotted ochre of a tiger lily. One did not ask here for peaches and
cream. And her eyes of light blue were as shallow and as deep as the
sky at noontime. Her nose and mouth, a trifle pinched, but wonderfully
alert--like the nose and mouth of little forest things dependent
for their lives on smell and taste--held him where more perfect
features had often left him indifferent. Her perfect little body, both
strong and light, had its own beauty. Rightly she should have been
barefooted. He had a notion she had as shapely a foot as Trilby’s.

Back of these physical attributes there was an undoubted personality,
and here again he was forced for comparison to the forest
creatures--the gentler ones like the doe and squirrel. Naïvely
wondering and trustful he saw her, ready to respond to affection,
quick to start at danger. It is flattering to any man to have such a
personality come to him without fear. As a result of it a man may feel
better than he is.

It is always dangerous to compare a woman with anything but a woman. It
is dangerous to compare them, anyway. Each one must be taken by herself
no matter how much like all others she turns out to be in the end.

Allston, in reviewing swiftly his few points of contact with Roxie,
could find nothing on his part that suggested indiscretion. He might
justly take a certain amount of satisfaction in that, but it did not
alter facts--if what he was beginning to suspect was a fact. He was by
no means sure of that even now. He meant to avoid being sure if that
were possible. The best way to accomplish this was to get Roxie out of
here at once and back to normal conditions.

Allston reached for his boots. They were still wet, but he forced them
on and laced them. Then he took his automatic and stepped out into the
hall to make sure Bud was safely tied. He found the man silent and
motionless, and without speaking to him returned to the sitting-room.
His plan was to notify one of the neighbors on his way down the
mountain road and have him come up and free the fellow.

Roxie had watched from the corners of her eyes every move Allston made.
And she realized that every step he took forced her that much nearer a
final decision. It was evident that he meant to go back and intended to
take her with him. But it was impossible for her to go back--impossible
for many reasons. And yet of them all she could not tell him one.

It was impossible because she could no longer remain in the same house
with him and Miss Wilmer--and yet to tell him why would be to tell him
all and she had told him too much already.

It was impossible because even if Miss Wilmer accepted her, the valley
folk would not. Yet, if she told him that, his next question would be
to ask why, then, had she come? To answer that would be to tell him
all.

It was impossible finally because it was utterly impossible. If ever
she left this house with him, Bud remaining behind alive, it would
mean his death more surely than as though she had not come at all.
She knew how Bud felt out there. She knew it with a keen realization
of the anguish he was suffering, which amounted at moments almost to
pity. Bud--he deserved it. He had brought it on himself. And yet it was
cruel hard. She did not enjoy seeing any one suffer. When she saw a
man kick a vicious dog, she was sorry for the dog. And Bud--he had his
bad points, but he was not a dog. Had Allston killed the man outright,
fighting for his own life as he had a right to do, she would have felt
no regret. Obliged to choose between the two men, she would not have
hesitated to choose for Allston. And she realized that all Allston had
done to Bud, after coming here, was necessary. Only he should not have
come.

That was the pity of it. His coming left her with no alternative--and
without her dreams. Bud could not be allowed to starve to death out
there. Some one would free him. Once free, he would kill. There would
be no hand left to stop him. It was doubtful if now even she could stop
him. But she must try.

To do that she must remain behind with him. She must give her
life--anything Bud asked for--to buy him off from his revenge. He would
ask all. There was no doubt about that. Perhaps in the end she might
not have enough. And yet if he wanted much she would have much to give.
The more he wanted, the more she would be able to give. So in the end
she must make him want--must whet his appetite. Here was a grim test
for a woman.

But that was all to come later. For the present she was concerned
alone with Allston. He must go and she must stay. The sooner this
happened, the better it would be for both. And this drove her quickly
and definitely to her final sacrifice. There was just one way in which
she could bring this about; one clear, logical way that would answer
for all time his every question and send him home safe and happy to
Wilmer. It came to her, as he reëntered the room with his jaws set so
firmly, that she was half afraid of him. As she thought of her plan,
she sprang to her feet and faced him with a nervous tremor. Most of the
color had gone from her cheeks on the instant.

“Roxie.”

He spoke sharply--incisively. She had never heard his voice like that.

“Yes, sir,” she answered.

“Put on your hat and coat.”

“What fer?”

“We’re going now.”

“Goin’ now? No, sir, I ain’t goin’ now.”

“Don’t delay,” he ordered. “And don’t be foolish.”

She braced herself--holding her feet a little apart as though steadying
for a blow.

“I ain’t goin’ now. I ain’t goin’ no time.”

Unconsciously she had fallen back into the vernacular both in words
and voice. There was a drawling softness to it that Allston noticed.
It made for tenderness. It was difficult for him to maintain his rigid
sternness in the face of it. Yet that was the only safe thing to do.

He seized her arm.

“Quick!” he commanded.

She shook herself free with a semblance of indignation. Most women are
born actresses, given the occasion. And Roxie had the occasion. Her
heart and soul were in the stand she was taking. Certainly the stake
was big enough--his life and nothing less. She was playing for a larger
salary than most real actresses receive.

“Don’ tech me!” she cried.

His brows came together.

“Good Lord--do you want me to throw you over my back?”

“Do I want ye ter throw me over your back?”

Her blue eyes flamed. Had it not been for the cost to him, that is
just what she would have liked. But the cost to him was what made it
impossible.

“Damn it, I’ll do it if you don’t come _now_,” he threatened.

(Out in the hall alone, Bud was clawing, clawing, clawing. He had been
clawing all this time. The tips of his fingers were bleeding, but the
rope was fuzzing deeper and deeper. Every now and then he stopped to
strain at it. Gawd A’mighty, if he should get free--!)

“Put on your hat and coat or I’ll do it for you,” insisted Allston.

The words she was trying to utter stuck in her throat. This acting
business was not so easy after all. Yet she found her voice when
Allston almost roughly seized her arm again. The touch of him gave the
inspiration she needed.

“I’m goin’ ter stay hyar. I’m goin’ ter stay with Bud,” she trembled.

“You what?”

“I come hyar with Bud. Ain’t I got a right?”

“But _why_ did you come?”

“I come because I wanted. He asked me ter marry him an’ I said I would.
Ain’t I got a right?”

“You mean you love him?”

Here was a direct question. It demanded a direct answer. She turned
her eyes around the shack like a frightened animal. The man before her
followed her gaze. She could not get away from him. So finally--

“Yes,” she answered.

“You came here of your own free will?”

“Yes.”

“And the note you wrote was simply to throw Miss Wilmer off the track?”

“I--I hed ter tell her somethin’,” she pleaded.

“Lord!” he broke out. “What a farce! What a farce!”

She did not know the meaning of his words, but she saw something like a
smile below his frown and she did not like that.

“If folks would only leave other folks alone!” she cried.

Allston started.

“There’s real philosophy in that,” he nodded. “If folks would only
leave other folks alone!”

(Bud was still clawing, clawing, clawing. It hurt. It hurt like the
devil now. He writhed under a new torture. He paused for breath as he
heard their voices in long-continued conversation. They gave him a new
incentive. He gathered himself together and throwing into the effort
every ounce of his strength he strained once again at the weakened
strands.)

Allston turned from the girl and paced the room once across and back.
The story she had just told came like a shock. It hurt, in a way,
his pride. It was a blow at his ideals. If at first it did not sound
plausible, it sounded upon second thought more plausible than the
original interpretation he had given. Natives, after all, were natives
in whatever part of the country they lived and however good to look
upon they were. It was perfectly normal for her to fall in love with
one of her own. And this man Bud, if no better than most of his fellows
hereabouts, was not much worse as far as his observation of the last
few weeks went. He was a little more autocratic and domineering than
some, but he liked him for that. Howe had spoken of him as “bad,” but
without much concrete evidence except for the story that he had once
killed a man. To Allston that did not sound as significant as it might
have done a few years back. He himself had killed his man. In battle,
to be sure, but so was Bud probably in a battle of his own.

Allston came back to his original position before Roxie. It was as
though she had grown older in the last few minutes. She did not stand
as straight. And so he suddenly saw her as fitting almost perfectly
into these surroundings.

“So that is it, Roxie,” he said more gently. “You came because you
wanted to come. And you’re here because you want to be here. But--you
aren’t married yet?”

The girl trembled at that.

“No, sir. I ain’t married yet. But Bud--he said to-morrer he’d marry
me.”

“And you believe him?”

“Yes, sir, I believe him. Oh--I gotter believe him.”

“Then you ought to have waited until to-morrow.”

“But I didn’.”

“You were afraid Miss Wilmer might object?”

“Yes, I was ’fraid o’ Miss Wilmer.”

“I think most likely she _would_ have objected. And yet if you love the
man--”

Why did she cringe at that?

“And yet if you love him--why, there isn’t any answer. Love is
seldom--intelligent.”

“I dunno,” she answered vaguely.

She wished that he would not talk any more. She wished that he would
go. Every second he remained was making it more difficult for her.

“You know the man and what they say of him?” he asked.

“Yes.”

“And of course you believe he loves you or you wouldn’t have come. And
that is the important thing; if he loves you, little girl. You’ll have
him at your mercy--if he loves you as he ought to love you.”

In her bewildered brain that suggestion of his seemed to fasten. It was
being loved, he said, not loving that was important. “You will have him
at your mercy,” ran his phrase. If only that proved true, then Allston
was safe.

“Why don’t ye go now?” she questioned.

Suddenly the lamp flickered. The flame flared up, then down, then up
again, smoking the chimney as a gust of wind swept down the hall and
into the room. Allston’s hand flew back to his automatic. Clutching it
he ran out into the empty hall. At the same moment Roxie ran to the
table and extinguished the light.




CHAPTER XIX


Bud had escaped. That was the meaning of the flickering lamp. And Roxie
understood well the danger to Allston of standing exposed, after this,
in a lighted room. Bud’s gun was here, to be sure, but he might have
another hidden about the place--in the barn or the spring-house.

Allston had run into the hall and, finding his man gone, had promptly
closed and locked the door through which he had escaped. The problem no
longer was to keep Bud in, but to keep him out. Cursing his stupidity
in not having maintained a closer watch, he struck a match in order to
search both side rooms. Roxie, running to his side, warned him of the
danger.

“He’ll shoot through the winder!” she cried.

This was a chance he had to take. Remembering his own ruse which had
gained him admission in the first place, he did not care to see it
repeated by another. He found both rooms empty. Bud had sought the open
where he would be able to secure another gun and ammunition.

It was uncanny how in the space of less than a minute the whole
situation had changed for all three of them. Roxie was quicker to
realize this fact than Allston. She was quicker because for her the
change meant more. Bud was now completely out of her power. As long as
he had lain there in the hall, she was still in control of him. She had
within herself the tribute price for Allston’s ransom. But with Bud
gone this opportunity had been snatched away from her. She was left
quite helpless--pitifully helpless.

And yet for a moment she felt as though suddenly soaring into the
clouds like a released bird. If she had lost her power over Bud, he
in turn had lost his power over her. For her this meant, for the time
being, freedom--a wild, unnatural sort of freedom. She was a prisoner
here with the man she loved. Their interests now, instead of being
opposed, were mutual. Bud was against them both. And there was nothing
she could do to prevent this; nothing Allston could do--until morning,
anyway. They were as isolated as on a desert island.

Allston himself did not see this, at first, quite as clearly. He was
for immediate action.

“We must get out of here quick!” he snapped.

“But we can’t,” she broke in eagerly. “He--he’ll kill us both. Bud’ll
kill us both.”

“You forget I’ve got his gun.”

“You’ve gut _one_ gun.”

“It’s the only one he had.”

“In his pocket. But outside he mought have others, an’ long’s ye don’
know, it’s jest as bad.”

“But when you don’t know you always have a chance.”

“If he ain’t gut a gun, he’s gut sticks and stones. He’d kill with
somethin’ afore yuh could git through the door.”

“There are two doors. He can’t watch them both.”

“Only yuh can’t tell which. An’ after what yuh done ter him--Oh, you
don’ know Bud like I do.”

“I know he’s killing mad,” admitted Allston.

And yet, had it not been for Roxie, he would have taken his chance and
made a dash for it. Once through the door it would be a fair fight. It
maddened him--even as it had maddened Bud--to be held in check like
this. He began to pace the room--keeping out of range of the glow from
the dying fire.

Then a new thought flashed into his mind. If what this girl had told
him was true--if she were really in love with Bud--then there would be
no harm in leaving her here.

She was standing in the shadows over by the table. He strode to her
side and she crowded close to him. She acted afraid, and that under
the circumstances was not natural. She ought to be glad that her lover
had escaped. And it made his own course obvious and simple. If he went
out, Bud would come in and this would end the whole affair. A moment
ago Roxie had refused absolutely to return with him. If that was her
position before Bud escaped, it was still her position. Had he gone
away and left her to free Bud--and he had seen no alternative--she
would have been exactly where she would be if he went now. Bud had only
forced by a few minutes the inevitable.

With only himself to consider, then, Allston did not propose to spend
the rest of the night up here. It was both humiliating and unnecessary.
It might easily turn out to be something worse. If he were not back at
the Howe bungalow by morning, the house would be in a turmoil. With
Roxie gone, too, his absence might be misinterpreted.

Here was a fair argument, and yet he was not altogether convinced that
it would hold. It did not explain fully Roxie’s present attitude. Well,
then his suggestion might force that explanation.

“Roxie,” he said quietly, “a moment ago you told me you came here
because you wished to come.”

“Yes, sir,” she admitted with a start.

“You said you were going to stay.”

“Yes, sir, I ’lowed I was goin’ ter stay with Bud.”

“Did you mean that?”

Her senses were acute. She felt he was leading her into some sort of
trap. She did not answer. Frantically she tried to guess the meaning of
it.

“Were you telling the truth?” he demanded.

“Yes, sir,” she answered because she was forced to answer.

“It’s hard to believe--somehow,” he said. “And yet I don’t know why it
should be. In time you were bound to marry, if not with Bud--then with
some other Bud. Perhaps I’ve been thinking of you as younger than you
are.”

“I’m eighteen,” she replied as a statement of fact.

“And that’s young or old according as you’ve lived. I saw men of
eighteen in France who were fifty.”

“Yes, sir.”

“There are moments when you seem older than that and moments when you
seem younger. That’s the trouble. What are you now?”

“I’m eighteen.”

“And you’re sure you know your own mind?”

“’Bout how I come to come up hyar with Bud?” she asked suspiciously.

“Yes.”

“Yes, sir, I know my own mind ’bout thet.”

“And about staying?”

“Yes, sir, I know my own mind ’bout stayin’. We--we gotter stay till
mornin’ now.”

“We?” he frowned.

“Bud, he--he’ll kill us certain.”

He spoke more sharply. He was only going around in a circle and he was
tired of circles.

“Listen, Roxie,” he said. “What you’ve told me about Bud changes
everything. It’s evident enough now that I butted in where I don’t
belong. If Bud loves you, and you love him, you’re safe enough here,
and the quicker I get out the better. What I want you to do is to make
what in the army we called a diversion. You stand out of danger and
swing open the back door and I’ll cut out the front. Bud ought to be
glad enough to see you to forgive your part in it.”

The girl cowered away. She did not speak. The silence became tense.

“That’s all there is to it,” he went on. “You’re game?”

Slowly the full irony of her fate made itself manifest to her. She did
not know it as irony. It seemed to her more like some cruelly righteous
form of retributive justice. The lie she had told to save the man she
loved had been turned against her to threaten his life. She had lied to
drive him out of this house away from Bud Childers and this same lie
was still working to drive him out--but this time into the clutch of
Bud. She did not believe for a moment that he had a chance to escape as
he proposed. He did not know Bud. Even if he got through the door, he
would not be allowed a hundred yards down the road. If he took to the
woods, he would be a stranger there against Bud who knew every foot
even by night. Bud would make sure and she could not stop him. The one
and only chance she had of protecting Allston now was to keep him here
until he was missed at home--until Miss Wilmer and Mr. Howe roused the
village and sent out help to him.

She had lost her power over Bud by staying without a struggle with
Allston. Her one opportunity for regaining her influence had been to
send Allston away and release Bud with her own hands. That would have
meant something to the man; it would have been a tangible proof of
her friendliness that he could have understood. To bring about this
opportunity she had deliberately sacrificed whatever good opinion of
her Allston may have had. And now Bud, by escaping, had spoiled all
those plans just as Allston, by coming, had spoiled all her other plans.

It was pitiful. She was stripped of her last vestige of influence over
either man. And this at a time when she needed it most; when she had
made each an even greater menace to the other.

That was because she had lied. It was wrong to lie. God hated a liar.
His punishment was terrible and swift. She saw that now as vividly as
though it were expressed in some flaming sign in the sky.

Trembling the girl clasped her two hands. She wanted to get down on her
weak knees and pray for forgiveness.

“Why don’t you answer, Roxie?” Allston questioned sharply.

She did not answer because she felt as helpless as a mere onlooker;
because she could no more think of what to say or do than a baby in
arms before some awful catastrophe about to envelop her. She found
herself repeating silently that little prayer which had been once
before her last refuge this fearful night. The second line she said
over and over again:

“I pray the Lord my soul to take. I pray the Lord my soul to take.”

That other time the steel-bladed knife which she had brought to the
shack as protection against Bud was the answer to her prayer. And now
the prayer--or a certain temporary poise resulting from reliance on
it--furnished her with another solution. In reality this answer sounded
more like the voice of God than had the other. If the suggestion was
daring, it was the sort of daring of which the Lord might be supposed
to approve. And it was both simple and logical like most of the acts of
God.

Swiftly Roxie looked up and met Allston’s blue eyes. She could not in
the shadows see much of them, but she felt them. They were steady and
honest--of that she was sure. They were the sort of eyes that made it
easier to tell the truth than to lie. And that was what the still,
small voice advised. If she were being punished now for not having been
honest, the only way she could redeem herself was from this moment on
to tell the truth. God might not forgive altogether her first offense,
but if the truth did not expiate it nothing would. No matter at what
cost to her pride, to her instincts as a maiden, she must tell the
truth.

“Speak,” he commanded.

So she spoke--her lips quivering.

“It--it ain’t Bud I love, it’s--it’s you,” she stammered.

“What?” he cried.

“It’s you,” she stumbled on. “Oh, it’s allers been you. I couldn’ help
it. I’m sorry.”

Queer, feeble, jerky little sentences these through which to express as
deep an emotion as that now shaking her--racking her. But they were the
best she could do.

And feeble though they were, they struck home to Allston like
knife-thrusts. He felt weak after them. For he believed--at least
that she believed. This explained a dozen facts that had been vague;
a dozen facts that he had allowed to remain vague even when they
aroused his suspicions, because he in his turn had refused to face the
truth. It was clear to him now why she had come here; it was because
of this love, to save him. No other explanation was big enough to make
plausible her willingness to risk her honor on this night alone with
Bud. And all the incidents that followed fitted in accurately and
convincingly.

Not for a second did Allston doubt her sincerity. And his big heart
flamed up in response to the nobleness and heroism and idealism of the
act--foolish as it was and as unworthy of it as he knew himself to be.

“God!” he breathed. “What a wonderful woman you are!”

“I couldn’ help it,” she moaned. “Bud--he said he’d kill yuh an’ he’d
’a’ done it too. An’ I thought--”

She looked so abject, so pitiful, so alone in her misery that
Allston could no more refrain from what he did next than he could
have refrained from picking up an outcast kitten mewing in the
cold. He stepped nearer and gathered her into his arms. She came
unresisting--weak from the continued tension of these last hours. She
buried her face on his shoulder, trying hard at first to stifle her
sobs, but finally letting herself go completely.

Allston held her tenderly and in silence. That seemed to be the only
thing to do. Words were quite useless; reason, unavailing. Whether she
was right or wrong or he right or wrong was not, in such a crisis,
important. This was some isolated moment to be handled by itself.

If he could not respond with the deep emotion that stirred her, he felt
his cheeks burning in answer to the clinging appeal of her warm arms,
to the clean incense of her hair, to the feverish eagerness of her
rapid breathing. He would have been either less or more than man had he
remained insensible. Lightly he brushed her flaxen hair with his lips.

He felt as though he had been swept back a hundred years--a thousand,
for all he knew; back to some time when the world was made up of
nothing but stars and trees and men and women. This mountain shack of
hewn logs might have been his own. And all he saw and all he knew was
what it contained and what the forest roundabout contained. The rest of
the world counted for no more than it did before the days of maps. Life
must be lived and its problems, as far as they concerned him, settled
right here.

Unconsciously his arms tightened about her lithe young body. In
response she raised her flushed face a little--shyly, but with new
confidence.

“You won’t go--now?” she whispered.

Her words startled him back to the present. His arms fell to his side.

“Now I _ought_ to go!” he cried.

A shattered pane of glass followed the report of a gun. Some one
outside was beginning to probe the shadows.




CHAPTER XX


Bud, after making his escape, ran down the mountain road to the home of
Roge Carver, where he borrowed a rifle and ammunition. Roge loaned both
without either question or comment, although later he admitted to his
neighbors that it did occur to him that the incident was more or less
unusual. It was not easy to understand how Bud happened to be without a
gun of his own when within so short a distance of his shack, or why he
needed one, anyway, on a stormy night at one o’clock in the morning.

“He was all riled up,” explained Roge. “So I didn’ hold no talk with
’um.”

No one disputed that as an unwise decision. When a man like Bud goes
gunning in the dead of night, he is best left alone. The explanation
Roge offered his wife when he returned to bed seemed fairly reasonable.

“Mebbe one o’ them Enfield boys is prowlin’ round.”

On the whole, however, it made little difference to his neighbors what
Bud was about as long as they were not immediately involved. That a
man out there alone on the mountain-side, in Stygian darkness, was
battling with all the devils of Hell did not interest them. Bruised and
sore from head to foot, with the tips of his raw fingers quivering, Bud
could fight it out and welcome as long as he kept to himself. It even
made little difference whether he lost or won.

As he staggered up the rocky road, he would have been the first to
admit the truth of this. This was his fight now--his alone. He could
depend upon neither God, man, nor the Devil for assistance. He was
against the universe and the universe against him. Even the mountain
wind bred in his own mountain trees had played him false. It had lured
him into danger at the door. It was trying to press him back even now
and whipping his black hair into his eyes. In desperate rage he cursed
it as he stumbled on.

No matter how small the man, there is something Homeric about his
struggles when he comes to grips with elemental forces. Whether king or
common slave, a man who swayed by big passions does his best against
odds acquires a certain majesty. Men respect even rats who fight hard
for life.

If Bud had been dominated at the moment of his escape by nothing but
black revenge, this, before he returned to the shack, had changed
into something else, no less intense, but on the whole worthier. His
objective remained still the same--the death of Allston. But while he
lay bound upon the floor suffering acute physical pain, he had looked
forward to this as a matter solely of personal satisfaction. It was man
to man then, with Roxie stimulating the enmity, but she herself almost
wholly eliminated from the final issue. Once Bud was free and, rifle
in hand, within sight of his own door again, the girl assumed to him
her old importance. Because, as he realized now, with Allston dead, she
would be left more than ever his. The first time he had secured no more
than temporary possession; this time possession would be permanent.

So after all he did not stand altogether alone against the universe.
With Roxie still alive that was not possible. God, man, and the
Devil--they could all be against him, but as long as he kept within
striking distance of this girl he could still hope. In a way she was
nearer him at this moment than she had ever been before. He had
until now been under certain restraints. She had forced upon him a
compromise. For her sake he had twice spared Allston. She could not
expect that again of him. The issue now was clean-cut and that suited
him better.

Within a hundred yards of his shack, Bud paused. The windows were
dark--a fact that made him smile grimly. It indicated that the two were
still within or they would not have taken this precaution. And that
they were still inside was all he asked. It meant that they must come
out--in one hour, two hours, ten hours, twenty hours. It did not much
matter when. They must come out of one of two doors.

Bud took up a position by the spring-house to the left. From that angle
he commanded either door. With rifle cocked he sat down to wait.

But waiting was a more difficult business than he anticipated. That was
because his thoughts refused to stand still. And yet often enough he
had sat on a rock for hours at a time waiting for a buck to pass down
a mountain trail--waited stolidly and indifferently for his quarry. He
had not then been worried by thought. He had been patient enough. This
was all that was necessary now.

If Allston had only been in there alone, Bud could have sat where he
was a week, indifferent to sleep, indifferent to hunger, indifferent
to the weather. Each passing hour then would only have heightened his
expectancy. But Roxie was there too.

He wondered what the two were doing. There were moments when he thought
he caught the sound of their muffled voices--as he had caught them when
he lay prone and bound on the floor. Then the moisture started to his
forehead and his arm muscles twitched and the tips of his raw fingers
began to quiver. He was tempted then to beat down one of those silent,
blank doors and force his way in.

Only he knew better. He would be shot in his tracks--through the
panels most likely. He did not underestimate his man--pink-cheeked,
lily-fingered though he might be. Lily fingers could pull a gun trigger
quite as easily as any other kind. Furthermore, he had had evidence
that Allston could shoot straight. He did not like to remember the
night of their first meeting when this stranger had shot the gun out of
his hands. Yet it was one of the things he could not forget.

He must wait--but what were they doing in there? Holding hands,
perhaps. Gawd A’mighty! And he sitting out here in the dark--sitting
outside his own home!

It was curious, but from the first Bud had never considered as a
possibility the fact that Roxie might really care for this stranger.
His mind could no more conceive this than that she should not in the
end care for himself. Allston was fooling her, that was all, and she
was being fooled. One of the traditional old wives’ tales hereabouts
was of a country girl ruined by a city chap. Bud had heard it since a
boy. He knew of other cases, too, where the villain had not been a city
chap; but those stories, though based on sounder evidence, were not
as dramatic. They were, perhaps because of this evidence, distinctly
commonplace.

Whatever Roxie’s relations with Allston were, then, they were only
temporary. And she was not at fault. She did not know men. It was the
old story of the summerer and his fine clothes, except that Roxie would
never be fooled too far. Bud knew that. He had known it before, but the
early part of this evening the girl had proven it. The little wildcat
had taken a knife out of her bosom and started for him. And he--well,
he was almost tempted to risk one cut for a kiss. Her eyes had stopped
him. They had warned that the cut would be deep.

Now she was in there with Allston. That was what made it hard to wait.
It was this which moved him from his position once and urged him to one
of those front windows. Cautiously he peered in. He could see only the
dying fire lighting dimly the hearthstones. But this sight maddened
him. It was cold outside, and here he was barred from his own fire. To
the right was a black shadow. Upon the impulse of the moment he raised
his rifle and fired into it. Then he moved back swiftly to his point of
vantage by the spring-house.

Nothing followed. The shadow evidently was only a shadow. It was
expecting too much to hope it was anything else. Roxie was no fool. She
would see to it that Allston kept out of range. For that matter Allston
himself was no fool.

Bud made up his mind that he could look forward to little action until
morning, and the only consolation he could get out of that was that
daylight would increase his chances. Daylight would make the result
certain. In the dark a man, no matter how good a shot, might shoot
wild. Once the sun was up Bud knew that not even a rat could move ten
inches from either doorsill.

With his rifle across his arm he sat down, his thin lips drawn taut,
his blue eyes as hard and cold as steel.




CHAPTER XXI


Allston did not minimize the danger of his situation. He knew that the
odds were against him and that those odds increased with every passing
hour. After dawn his chances of getting out alive would be ten to one
against him. But his only alternative was to make a dash for it with
Roxie, and that would be to risk her life as well as his own. Bud would
shoot at anything that moved from either door. He must wait until Bud
could distinguish clearly between them.

Allston accepted his lot like a gentleman. He even appreciated the grim
irony of his plight--the sardonic humor of it. He had come up here to
save Roxie and had succeeded in doing nothing but endanger her; she
in her turn had come here to save him and had only placed his life in
jeopardy. Both had been actuated by the highest motives, but these had
worked only for their doom.

There was something wrong about that. Though helpless, Allston was
by no means resigned to any such outcome; neither for Roxie nor for
himself. There was too much good in this girl to have any misfortune
come to her. As for himself, life had never seemed sweeter. He did not
mean to let go of it without a struggle.

Yet, too, life had never been more confused. Roxie clung to him now
like a child in alarm. After her confession, she abandoned herself
utterly to her emotions--quite trustfully, without a trace either of
fear or reserve. Yet she did not seem bold. Her sincerity saved her
from that.

They had retreated into the far corner to the left of the fireplace,
out of range of any window, and here they sat down upon the floor. This
child-woman snuggled up to him kitten-wise, her head upon his shoulder.
And he placed his arm about her, knowing her as half child and half
woman; more child than most children, more woman than most women.

So, a thousand years ago, he might have sat in some cave guarding his
woman against the entrance of wild beasts. Inhaling the incense of
her hair, feeling the quick beating of her heart, conscious of the
love which had already sacrificed so much for him, which was ready to
sacrifice so much more, it was difficult to drag himself back to the
present; difficult to see straight.

Yet that is what he must do--whether he lived on or not. To see
straight while he did live was more important than living on. And in
this crisis the calm, steady brown eyes of Wilmer Howe came to help him.

He had not forgotten her. Something of her presence had been with him
all the evening. He had felt it again and again, though in the turmoil
of vivid details which followed so swiftly one after another he had not
always visualized her. And it had not been easy either to tell just
what part she was playing in this isolated drama up in these black
hills. Their relations had been so purely intellectual that it was
difficult to fit her into action so largely physical--the clash of body
against body rather than mind against mind.

But now, it seemed almost as though she were standing before him, a
silent onlooker. The suggestion was startling enough at first. It sent
the blood to his cheeks. And then he found himself meeting her imagined
gaze quite coolly. There was nothing here of which he need feel ashamed
even before her.

It was very quiet inside the shack. Outside the wind was still reeling
in and out among the trees boisterously as a drunken sailor, but
distinctly it was outside. The doors were safely barred. The gale
scarcely stirred the dark within save when occasionally it puffed down
the chimney and revived into a glow the dying embers. And the girl
in his arms lay very still like one not daring to move for fear of
breaking a spell.

It was only a few hours ago that Allston had left Wilmer, but he felt
as though days must have passed. Yet less than five hours before, she
had lighted her candle and excusing herself had gone upstairs to her
room. He had watched her pretty feet as they twinkled out of sight. A
half-hour later, he had no doubt, she was sound asleep.

Perhaps, in her dreams, she had followed him up here; perhaps, in her
dreams, she was now looking to see what he was about. The continued
silence began to rouse his imagination. It did so even in the face of
the startling reality he was still confronting. With Roxie’s heart
beating against his arm, it was not of her he thought, but of this
other.

If Allston had been timid in his mental approach to Wilmer before, he
was bold enough now. With a possible margin of only five hours of life
ahead, a man must needs be bold if ever. True values assert themselves
willy-nilly in such a crisis.

He had realized from the moment of Bud’s escape that never had the
desire to live been so keen in him, and in the next few hours he
learned why. In France he had faced death even more intimately than he
was doing to-night and had done it with a certain indifference. Not
that he was either dulled or depressed; not that he was insensitive to
what life meant or that he sought escape from its responsibilities. He
was then in an utterly negative state with the issue completely out
of his hands. And he had seen so much of death that it had lost its
horror. About the only distinction he made between live men and dead
men was that the former were still able to move. The latter lay quietly
where they crumpled up--sometimes for days. He had passed groups of
such immobile forms as unemotionally as he passed broken tree branches.

On his mission up here to-night, he had not considered death either one
way or the other, although he had sensed his danger. Roxie herself was
the one who finally brought him face to face with a full realization of
the issue. It was she who had finally forced the fatal situation. And
she had done this, unwittingly and unconsciously, in the name of love.
Humbly and out of a full heart he drew his arm tighter, and she opened
her eyes and looked up into his face and smiled.

Lord, what was this thing called love? It was symbolized as a winged
cherub and expressed in terms of June roses, and yet it drove men
relentlessly to the very brink, and over, of death. And women, too;
young women scarcely out of girlhood.

And it drove men on to life when death would be simpler. Allston did
not want to die. He wanted to get back to Wilmer. Give him one more
hour alone with her and he would beat down her reserve--would sweep her
into his arms and hold her there. He had been playing with love. He
had not realized the bigness of his passion. It had seemed to him some
dainty, fragile emotion to be handled as cautiously as a delicate vase.
And love was one of the two vital things of a man’s being. There were
only two; love and death. Everything else was trivial. And love was
neither of the intellect nor of the heart. It was of the soul.

That day in the cove when he had seized Wilmer’s hand, his soul had
spoken. It had bid him take, then and there. She had drawn back from
him--yes. But that was because he was half-hearted. He had not pressed
on.

Roxie moved a little.

“You’re cold?” she asked anxiously.

“No. Are you?”

“Cold--here?”

“The fire is going out,” he answered. “I’ll poke around and see if I
can’t find a blanket.”

“Please don’t,” she pleaded.

But he rose abruptly. He needed to be on his feet. Instantly she rose,
too.

“He’ll git yuh through the winder.”

“You stay here,” he ordered.

“Mister Allston!”

He moved down the hallway towards one of the side rooms. She followed.

“Stay where you are,” he commanded.

She obeyed, but her lips began to tremble. She did not want to let him
out of her sight. She was afraid lest the dark might swallow him up
forever. She was none too sure of him now. The fairy book might close
at any moment and the story end.

But he came back with his arms full of blankets torn from the
bed--clean new blankets which Bud had bought within a week. He spread
one down upon the floor for her to lie on.

“Perhaps you can get a little sleep in the next few hours,” he
suggested.

“Only I don’ wanter sleep,” she answered.

“Lie down, anyway.”

“What you goneter do?”

“I’m going to cover you up.”

“And then?”

“I’m going to think, Roxie. I’m going to think hard.”

“Here?”

“Here beside you.”

“All right.”

She lay down prone upon her back and he covered her as he might have
covered a child.

“You’ll save one blanket for yuhself?” she asked.

“I don’t need any.”

“Please. It’ll be cold afore mornin’.”

To quiet her he threw one over his shoulders and resumed his place near
her. She reached for his hand, found it, and grasped one finger. So she
thought she held him safe.

It was well enough for her to think so during those next few hours.
It brought her comfort and did no harm to any one. Yet, tight as she
gripped that finger, he--though she did not know it--instantly slipped
away. She had no more of him than a few hours before Bud had had of her.

But it was the feel of her warm hand that made Allston realize that
the difference between life and death is not so crudely simple as the
difference between mobility and immobility. That distinction satisfied
the God of War. He was content with incapacity. Ineffectiveness was
death. He even preferred total disability because it turned a man from
an asset into a liability, though still able to feel and to think.

But the God of Peace, when He marked a man, did not stop here. He
demanded annihilation. With the body must go all the emotions and all
the thoughts. A man to be dead must be dead all over--must be resolved
into his elements. Nothing must be left of him on this planet except a
memory. And that faded as rapidly as an unfinished print.

Allston did not propose to submit to any such programme without a
struggle. Before such a contingency every sense became doubly acute.
He was as alert to sounds as a squirrel. He jumped at every creak,
not in fear, but in readiness. The automatic in his hand responded
subconsciously, finding direction with sureness. His eyes pierced the
dark so that he saw even into the far corners of the room where before
he could not see. Once a rat crept out of the hallway and before he
knew what he was about Allston had fired--and killed. Roxie sprang up
quivering from head to foot, and it took him ten minutes to quiet her.

But if Allston was alert to the present, he was even more alert to the
future. His thoughts ran ahead like galloping horses in response to
the call of new needs. He had, all these years, merely scratched the
surface while he thought he had been digging deep into the very bowels
of the earth. Before he was out of college he had in an academic way
been ready to grapple with life. On top of that he had, through war,
been brought into deadly contact with life itself--with what he had
considered the big basic elements of existence. He had been plunged
from poetry into prose. So he had completed the cycle. There was little
left for him to know. His own problem was to classify and card-index
his wide experiences--to put them in order for use.

Only one element had been left out of the past few years--a relatively
unimportant element. That was the element of love--a distinctly
peace-time element. He had even touched upon that superficially. And
he had more or less expected to go into it more fully at his leisure.
But not until the noise of the big guns was out of his ears; not until
the ghastly realities had faded away; not until the little mounds
had flattened down and the trenches been filled in; not, in brief,
until--if ever--he was able to get away from actuality into that
pleasant poet’s paradise of dreams. There would be time enough then for
the pretty drama of love.

So he had thought of it. So he had stepped forward lightly to meet the
little winged cherub. So he had challenged him to shoot his swiftest
and straightest. Even after he had felt the first sting of the dart, he
had smiled on. The wound smarted, but it was by no means serious.

Then this night had come--the second act of a whimsical Barrie comedy.
There was heightened action at the rise of the curtain, but that might
be significant or not. He had held himself ready to laugh at any
moment. As the scene progressed, it had not been as easy, but still he
would have followed any cue Wilmer had given him up to the moment she
lighted her candle and disappeared for the night.

The succeeding scenes followed quickly, and they had ranged from
melodrama to genuine tragedy, all based on this one theme of love.
Not, however, love as he had conceived it. This had been no affair for
winged cherubs to indulge in. And it had ceased to be a play. It was
too serious--too grimly real for that. This had been a man’s game. And
a woman’s game, too. But the stakes were terribly high.

Sitting there in the corner of this darkened shack waiting for the
dawn (which for all he knew might turn out to be night), with this
other palpitating human being so curiously involved with him, Allston
began to sense something of what love really is. As he vibrated to the
dynamic power of this mighty force, he began to sense something of what
life really is. And the two were one.

The two were one; that was the full significance of both love and
life. A man floundered on trying to separate the inseparable until he
discovered this. Neither prose nor poetry; reality nor dreams; man
nor woman, had any real existence apart from the other. When they did
unite, their potentiality was akin to that of God. Out of that union
came all the big things that are; came life itself.

Concretely this meant for Allston that woman with whom he had been in
such light contact during these last few weeks. It meant Wilmer Howe.
And yet it did not mean the Wilmer who in her pretty setting had been
acting her dainty comedy--the idyl of the winged cherub--but the real
woman back of her; the woman of flesh and blood whom for a few brief
seconds he had felt when he grasped her hand; the woman who was, if she
was at all, in the secrecy of her room. And how he hungered for her
now in this crisis! How, had she been near, he would have dragged her
out of herself--brutally if necessary! How, had she been as close to
him as this other was, he would have covered her hair and forehead with
kisses, kisses both sacred and burning. His lips grew hot and dry at
thought of it.

Roxie opened her drowsy eyes.

“Yer warm enough?” she asked with the tenderness of a cooing dove.

Allston started.

“Yes,” he answered.

“I feel’s though I was goin’ asleep.”

“That’s the best thing you could do,” he replied.

“I’ve dreamed a dream like this,” she smiled gently.

“You might as well keep on dreaming--till morning.”

That was the best thing she could do. And he was entitled to his
dreams, too, until morning. So he gave himself up to them riotously,
but with his eyes wide open and his brain clear--as though they were
not dreams at all. It was as though Wilmer had come to him here and
made herself an integral part of him--blending into him until she
became one with him.

It was Roxie who was dreaming. Her eyes were closed and her breathing
regular. Yet from time to time she stirred uneasily in her sleep.
Then Allston, fearing lest she take cold, slipped the blanket from
his shoulders and threw it over her--very gently so that she would
not awake. Her face in repose appeared even younger. It was quite
untroubled. He thanked God for that. If only she were sleeping safe in
her own bed as she should be!

Allston became aware of the approaching dawn even before there was
light. The wind died down so that it was quite still all about the
shack. But within, the air became fresher with the clearness of
atomized spring water. When the light did begin to come, it came
subtly. It was more as though the dark were being diluted. Without
moving, Allston watched the process with weird fascination. He wished
the girl to sleep as long as that was safe, but he knew this could not
be for long. The sun was coming up behind those dark ridges, and it was
only a question of a very brief time when it would enter here and leave
them as exposed as though the wall of the shack were torn down. Every
window would be a menace. There would not be a corner left in which
they could hide.

He did not wish to hide. Light was what he was waiting for--light that
would allow Bud to distinguish between him and Roxie. Only he must time
himself nicely; it must be clear enough not to permit of any mistake on
Bud’s part, but not clear enough to allow the man to shoot through the
windows.

On the shelf over the fireplace there was a row of crocks. As soon as
he was able to count these, Allston would rouse the girl. That time
came within five minutes. He made out four of them--one, two, three,
four. He placed his hand on Roxie’s head and whispered her name. She
started to her feet, staring about wildly.

“Steady,” whispered Allston. “It’s morning.”

The girl was confused. It was difficult for her to grasp the situation.

“Listen,” he commanded. “I’m going out before he can see us here. It’s
the only way. You’re to stay behind until I get across the clearing.
Then you follow. You’ll be safe.”

“I’ll be safe!” she cried. “But you?”

“I must take my chances.”

“Then I wanter take mine--with yuh.”

“You’ll only spoil mine,” he frowned. “I can get across there alone,
and once in the woods I’ll wait for you. Straight from the house and
across the road. You understand?”

“No-o-,” she whimpered.

“If he tries to stop you, I’ll have him covered. Straight across and
into the woods.”

Already the crocks on the shelf were becoming too visible.

“You’ve been game till now; be game to the end,” he whispered.

Beseechingly she stood before him with uplifted face. He stooped and
brushed her forehead.

“God bless you--whatever happens,” he choked.

Then, before she could catch her breath, he swung open the door and,
crouching a little, dashed out. He had not gone ten feet before a rifle
cracked from the spring-house.

Allston crumpled up like an empty sack.




CHAPTER XXII


It was half-past nine when Wilmer left Allston alone in front of the
open fire and went upstairs. And though it was after midnight before
she fell asleep, she had not then heard his footsteps along the hall.
She had listened, too, rather closely. The man had been in her thoughts
every minute since she bade him good-night and retreated to her room.
Her abrupt and somewhat inhospitable departure was a retreat--nothing
less. She had been neither weary, sleepy, nor bored. In fact, she
had retired at a moment when she had felt herself more than usually
alert and alive both mentally and physically--more alive than she
felt it either discreet or safe to be. When a carefully nurtured and
intelligent young woman finds herself prompted to such intimate acts
of tenderness as smoothing back the hair from the forehead of a man
she has lately chided for being too boldly impulsive, it would seem
to be high time for her to remove herself out of danger even though
that involves a humiliating confession. It was no argument either that
because his hair was light and all awry, it appeared like the hair
of a boy; or that because his face was troubled, her tenderness was
justified on purely humanitarian grounds. Besides, she had considered
nothing of the sort. She had wished to do it because some newly roused
instinct craved satisfaction in just that way.

There was no use in lying. That was both cowardly and useless. If there
were mortal sin here this was no way of ridding one’s self of it. One
should probe for causes. That is what the intellect is for. The ability
to do this or not is what distinguishes between the intelligent and the
unintelligent.

Well, then, the reason she had wished to smooth back the hair from
Allston’s forehead was because--she had wished to do it. He was worried
and she held herself partly responsible. She could not help this. She
had tried to be honest both with him and herself--to speak the truth
as she saw it. But having done this she was sorry because it had not
helped to dissipate his perplexity. It had only more deeply involved
them both. Words had been unavailing. It was then that this strangely
primitive impulse had asserted itself. Her warm hand urged her to
express what her tongue could not.

She had conquered the temptation. That is a woman’s lot; to conquer and
conquer and conquer. Given emotions more acute than those of men, she
is asked to control them more completely. If she does not, she is never
forgiven. She has betrayed her trust.

She had conquered the physical impulse, but that was all. Alone here
in her room she knew that. The old tenderness returned--the tenderness
that sought expression in action. And after all perhaps it was not so
strange. Men have always sought and women always given this tangible
proof of their feelings. Down through the years a woman has spoken her
heart through the touch of her hand and lips. Speech has been left for
men.

In her room with the dark all around her, Wilmer allowed herself to
relax somewhat. But vigilance is the eternal price of liberty in more
senses than one. The moment she permitted her thoughts to wander where
they would, they went where she would not. Only once before had she
felt herself the victim of this unseen power, and the man who was
responsible now lay dead at Château-Thierry.

She had been younger then. Over twenty, every year counts double in a
woman’s life until she reaches full maturity. Her youth had been an
excuse where now it no longer was. And yet she doubted if at twenty she
would have had to fight so hard for control. Her emotions were feebler
then.

To add to her confusion she was not at all sure what it was she was
trying to repulse. There is so much vagueness in a young woman’s
life; so much hinted at, but never made clear; so much guessed, but
not known. It is probably true that they are more of a mystery to
themselves than to the young men who look upon them with such awe. It
was certainly true of Wilmer in spite of all her reading.

No two authorities seemed to her able to agree on this thing called
love; whether it was something to welcome or something to be guarded
against. Before Allston came along she had been inclining to the
latter view, for it appeared to lead more often to unhappiness than to
happiness. Most tragedies were born of love; the great tragedies as
well as the sordid little ones. In most cases woman was the victim, and
when not, most certainly deserved to be. The good women suffered to
themselves; the bad women caused others to suffer.

If this were true, then love was something to be fought off like an
evil spirit. But the trouble was that instead of gaining strength
as she struggled, as in other contests of her life, she felt her
resistance to be constantly weakening. The more she argued, the feebler
became her arguments; the more bitterly she condemned herself, the more
ardently she desired. Hour by hour her intellect had been giving way to
her emotions. She was becoming, looking at it in one way, less and less
intelligent in her attitude to this burning problem.

And yet if her slow retreat did not bring her back into safer
territory, it left her on more familiar ground. Forced to her base,
she found that base to be her heart. And her heart was more peculiarly
herself than her mind.

There are, in every woman, two women; the one coolly, calmly,
deliberately, intelligently formed, and within her another, often
enough imprisoned for life, the creation of God. Shyly the latter
sits in silence peeping as she finds her opportunity through the
eyes--safe hidden in the eyes--or makes her presence felt through
a touch of the hand or, in full power, through the lips. And this
woman grows and grows if given half a chance. If not she sickens and
dies--pathetically, tragically. And what is left after that may be
admirable, but does not win admiration.

It was face to face with this other self that Wilmer now found
herself--an elfish, wholly irresponsible self, although governed by
something bigger even than thought. And when the word love reached this
other, it was as though she sprang into radiantly full being. Flushed
and palpitating, eyes brimming with daring and eagerness, she asserted
herself. She was Youth with all the hardy qualities of youth; she was
Life with all the adventurous enthusiasm of life; she was Womanhood
with all the steady courage of womanhood. She asked no questions, but
she whispered secrets.

She whispered secrets to Wilmer lying there in the dark--big
secrets, holy secrets, quickening secrets. She spoke of love quite
fearlessly--at times almost fiercely. With eyes that were like the
blazing sun, with nostrils that quivered, with a mouth opened for frank
laughter, she challenged the world to deny her.

And Wilmer, her pretty white arm thrown over her forehead, stared and
marveled until finally her eyes grew heavy and she slipped away into a
dream world.

She awoke at dawn. She started to her elbow to listen once again for
the footsteps of Allston. The house was silent--the utter silence of
early morning. She realized then that she must have slept and that he
had passed her door during that interval. She fell back to her pillow,
but her eyes remained wide open. She had a feeling that something had
happened in the last few hours--something big. It is so one awakes
after joyous news, unable for a second to recall it. The emotion
remains, but unrelated. Then suddenly she remembered, and her face
became as radiant as the face of that other woman. She _was_ that other
woman--that heart woman. In her dreams, love had taken possession.

She sprang from bed, and crossing to the open window looked out at
the dawn. The quickening sky greeted her like a sister. The east was
still a silver gray, but it looked so fresh and clean and cool that
impulsively she threw out her arms towards it. So she did towards all
the trees and grasses, though they were still half hidden in the dark.
There were shadows there, too, but they were friendly shadows. She did
not fear them in the least. They called to her to come out under the
sky and be refreshed like them.

She felt cramped here in her room. She wished to be part of the dawn.
And so dressing quickly she stole downstairs to the sitting-room. The
fire was out, but the chair in which Allston had sat was still in its
place before the cold hearth. Her hand fell upon it caressingly. It
had become individualized to her. There were other chairs in the room
of similar design, but these were merely so many indifferent pieces of
wicker furniture. This was his chair. This would always be his chair.

She moved across the room to find a wrap, and when opposite the door
leading into the kitchen was stopped by a draft as from an open window.
That was unusual because her father was rather finicky about having
the house tight-locked at night, and Roxie knew this. For a moment she
hesitated. It was not yet full day, but she could see well enough to
distinguish objects within. Perhaps Roxie was up. She often rose early.

Wilmer ventured to the threshold and called the girl’s name. She
received no response, but she saw then it was not a window but the
outside door that was open. It affected her as something dramatic.
Nothing can be more significant than a door open when it should be
closed or closed when it should be open. It involves a human element
that may mean much.

On the whole, Wilmer was now sorry she had come down here. She was no
more than ordinarily timid, but there is something unnatural about a
house before it has awakened. The silence, for one thing, is intensive.
One feels like an intruder, and like an intruder is never sure of what
one may stumble upon. The night things do not vanish except before
direct rays of either sun or lamp.

Finally, with considerable effort, she crossed the kitchen and
hurriedly closed the door--with an odd feeling, before it latched, that
something from without might resist her efforts. She was left a little
out of breath. Which was absurd, of course. She realized this as soon
as she had turned the lock.

But now the dead stove and the dumb kettle and the silent pots and pans
hanging all around oppressed her. A kitchen is a living thing expressed
in terms of noise and movement. When it is quiet and still, it is out
of character. Moreover, it emphasized the absence of Roxie. She was
always here, or at least some evidence of her.

Wilmer listened for her footsteps overhead. She ought by now to be
dressing. The first feeble chirps of the early birds could be heard
outside and she always rose with them. It was not necessary for her to
get up at this hour, but she always did.

A peculiar sense of loneliness swept over Wilmer. She felt suddenly
conscious of being the only live thing about in the house. She wished
to see Roxie--to hear another human voice. It was this which impelled
her up the stairs to the girl’s door. It was closed and she heard no
movement within. She rapped gently and received no response. Then she
turned the knob and gently pressed the door open. Her eyes sought the
bed. It was empty.

And in the center of the room there stood one shoe and beside it a bit
of paper. She picked up the note and hurrying to the window read it.
Her heart stopped beating for a moment. Roxie had gone. Reading between
the lines as clearly as Allston had done, she knew with whom. But there
were some other things between the lines, clear enough to Allston,
which she did not understand.

Clutching the crumpled bit of paper, Wilmer came back to the
sitting-room. When the note had been written, she had no way of
knowing, but the undisturbed bed indicated that it was the evening
before. Roxie was generally asleep by ten. She had been gone, then,
some seven hours. But why had she left at such an hour if with Bud? She
had heard the girl in the kitchen until after nine, and that was too
late for the completion of even a runaway match. There was an element
of the inexplicable here which urged her to seek Allston at once. And,
besides, she wanted him for herself.

Here was an emergency demanding action, and she turned to this man as
naturally as, a day ago, she would have turned to her father. As soon
as this, he had slipped into place by her side. He was there to help
whenever she needed help. And he was there in a more vital sense than
ever her father had been. If the latter was a wise counselor, he also
stood in need of counsel; if a protector, he also was often in need of
protection. If he was her right hand, she was his left hand.

But Allston stood out full-bodied, by himself. He needed no assistance.
He could relieve her wholly of such a responsibility as this.

And yet, as she made her way up the stairs and down the hallway to his
room, she began to question. To give him this note was to rouse him.
To place this situation before him was to lead him into danger. For
he would follow Roxie. There was no doubt about that. He would follow
until he learned whether the girl had entered upon this mad venture of
her own volition or not. That involved a terrible risk.

Wilmer, a few feet from his door, paused, leaning against the wall for
support. If she waited a few hours, then he might seek help on his
mission. A dozen men from the village would be willing to accompany
him on such an errand. With the house surrounded, Bud would be forced
to explain or to surrender.

But if Roxie were in actual danger, then a few hours might mark the
difference between life and death, between honor and dishonor.

It was a cruel dilemma in which to place a woman in so brief a time
after she had awakened to the full realization of love. It made little
difference that her love had not yet been confessed--even that she
had no assurance that it would be reciprocated. Once she had made the
admission to herself, it existed--even if she lived the rest of her
years with lips tight sealed. To her it was a reality at this moment--a
stupendous reality. She loved as only a woman can love who has fought
against love. It burned within her now like a white-hot flame.

In the end her decision was based, not upon Roxie, but upon herself
and the man she loved. To be true to that love, she must send him;
to be true to that love, he must go. If this new-found passion meant
anything, it meant being true to the highest; it meant willingness to
sacrifice to the highest. If she quailed before such a clean-cut issue
as this, she could never again respect that love; if she saved him at
such a cost, she could never respect that which she had saved.

With head up, if with knees weak, she knocked at his door. And as she
did so it was as though not her hand but her naked heart were beating
against the wooden panels. The ache of it made her tremble. To add to
the agony she was forced to do it again--and yet again. The silence
following hurt, too. It raised new fears. These accumulated so rapidly
that she was soon in a panic. Scarcely conscious of what she was about,
she turned the knob and pushed open his door--standing back as she did
so. Light is indifferent. It cares not what it reveals. It showed now
with grim starkness Allston’s empty, untouched bed.

And a vacant room.




CHAPTER XXIII


The fact that Allston had gone last night and had not yet returned
was as convincing proof to Wilmer of some mishap to him as a direct
message would have been. Had he accomplished his purpose, he would have
been back within three hours--four at the most. Such undertakings are
decided quickly. When two strong men meet in mountain country over such
an issue, the argument is not long-drawn-out. And the end is apt to be
definite.

So for a moment the girl stared at the empty bed as one stares
helplessly at the jerky telegrams on yellow paper that are brutally
thrust into one’s life. Direct blows between the eyes these, which
stun. And however grimly concrete the news, it is difficult to
understand because it comes through such a thin medium. All is
well--then a bit of yellow paper--and all is over.

Wilmer did not have even as much as a written report; just an opened
door and silence. But if the message had been written in burning
letters of fire or shouted at her through a megaphone, it could have
told her no more. He had gone to meet Bud Childers and he had not come
back.

Dazed as the girl was, she held herself well. Facing the little things
about his room, she stood straight as though facing something of him.
His courage called for her courage. Whatever had happened to him, she
knew he had accepted like a man, so that whatever had happened, she
must accept like a woman. If some of the color vanished from her cheeks
that was not her fault. She could not control this. But she could
control her trembling lips and did. Turning from the room, she found
her way back downstairs and to the sitting-room. There she saw again
his chair--the chair in which he had sat last evening. For a second she
tottered. All the little things of him seemed so doubly important now.
Every suggestion of him was so vital. It might be--it might be that
this was all she had left; traces at a moment when she hungered for a
hundred times more than she had ever had when within arm’s length of
him.

She pronounced his name below her breath. Just this--

“Ned.”

Then louder as though the name itself could bring him nearer.

“Ned,” she called. “Ned.”

She received no answer. The man who had been here yesterday--who would
have responded to her lightest whisper--did not count. And if he could
have answered as of yesterday, that would not have counted. It was
to-day--now--that she wanted him. It was this minute--this second. She
wanted him to come to her and place his arms about her and hold her
tight; she wanted the feel of his lips and the sound of his voice. She
wanted him in the flesh with all his tousled light hair. She was empty
without him--as empty as a mother with an unweighted arm.

Tears started to her hot eyes, and, burying her face in her hands, she
knelt before the wicker chair as before a sacred shrine.

“God, give him back to me,” she pleaded. “I want him. I want him so.”

If all the prayers of women were answered, perhaps there would be no
need of other prayers. How many go trembling up through the day and
through the night!

Wilmer rose again to her feet--steadied and strengthened. It may be
that this is the most direct and best answer God can give--strength to
endure, strength to act. She moved towards the kitchen--towards the
door she had found opened. It was as though this were the beginning of
the trail leading to his side. She had no pre-conceived plan, but her
feet took her here. This was the path Roxie had taken; the path Ned
Allston had taken. It was the path she must take.

Her heart leaped in response to the suggestion. She must follow him. If
he could not come to her, she must go to him. In essence the idea was
foreign to her nature. She was neither bold nor venturesome. Ordinarily
she would have turned to her father, but now this never occurred to
her. He played no part in this early morning drama. He slept and he
must sleep on. This did not concern him. It concerned her alone--that
inner woman who in a sense had never had a father.

The drawer of the kitchen table was open--pulled far out. Her eyes
caught the gray sheen of steel. She had never seen these articles
except as so many cooking-utensils. But they were more than that; they
were weapons. They were knives. And knives were for both defense
and offense. She crossed the room and picked out one--a thin-bladed,
pointed knife worn down by much use. She thrust this into her bosom and
returned to the door. She unlocked it, swung it open, and went out into
the dew-wet grass.

The cool of the unwarmed dawn air which met her hot skin and bathed her
eyes and refreshed her dry throat as she drank it deep into her lungs,
braced her like wine. Down the serpentine drive she went walking with
long, steady strides, unhurried in spite of her excited heart and with
chin well up. She wore no hat; no coat. She needed none. Her brown
hair, which had not been as carefully arranged as usual this morning,
soon fell loose until it hung all about her flushed cheeks gypsy-wise.
Had any one glimpsed her, he would surely have thought it Roxie who was
abroad at such an hour. For though taller she was walking with that
rhythmic swing, all from the hips down, which only those acquire who
have lived long in mountain country and walked much. And her feet were
sure on the rocky ground.

The sky grew pink in the east, but she saw it not. Birds began to stir
and sing among the wet leaves, but she heard them not. Squirrels began
to chatter--squirrels she loved to stop and tease--but she gave no heed
to them. As far as she was concerned this colorful, vibrant world about
her was as desolate as the moon surface. Her thoughts were all of the
man towards whom she was speeding.

She knew this road well. It was the same she had taken with him after
that adventure in the sunlit cove which lay so near the mountain path
leading to Bud’s shack. She had laughed at her father’s fears when the
latter warned them to avoid that neighborhood. How trivial that whole
incident now seemed to her, and yet it had played its part. It was
playing its part now. It was leading her with sure feet to his side.

But what was she going to find after she reached his side? It was a
question she fought off. And yet, batlike, the question returned to
circle again and again around her thoughts.

Leaving the sandy road that skirted the lower end of the valley, her
course took her upwards on a trail rough as a stream-bed. It ran like
a tunnel through the dark of crowding trees. Laurel and rhododendron
and sourwood in a snarling tangle beneath beech and oak pressed close,
as though bent upon obliterating this rough gash hacked through their
fastness. Overhead the dark branches came together and shut out the
sun. It was damp and shaded here and the pungent smell of the earth met
her as though she were burrowing. She hurried a little up the steep
path with an uncanny feeling that if she delayed too long she might be
enveloped. The growing things might seize her, might twine their snaky
limbs about her and force her down into this same earth from which they
sprang. And the earth was cold and damp. She wanted none of it. She
began to feel stifled, and broke into a panic-stricken run that took
the breath out of her. Halfway up she had to stop. But she refused to
sit down. She did not dare sit down. She stood in the center of the
road, her head upturned, her eyes trying to pierce the green canopy
above. With her hands hanging limply by her side, she breathed through
her mouth because her nostrils did not furnish enough air. Had any one
come upon her so, he would have thought her some wild thing fleeing
from the hunters.

Up she climbed and up where the dawn did not reach before high noon;
up and up and up. Until she saw the end of the tunnel. Then, breaking
into a run again, she never stopped until she plunged out upon the top
where man had fought the trees to the death and left a summit of upland
pasture open to the sky, and made rich farmland covered with blue grass
dotted with grazing cattle. She felt like a diver coming up from deep,
brackish water. She threw herself prone on her back for a moment, her
eyes fixed on the wide expanse of clean blue sky, shot with gold up
here. Below her lay the crescent-shaped valley--a picture so serenely
peaceful in contrast to what she had just come through that only the
psalmist could adequately express it. The lines though unspoken came to
her lips:

“He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the
still waters. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me.”

All her life she had uttered these words without any appreciation save
of their rhythmic beauty. Now they were like a voice from the sky
itself. They quenched, like cold water, the fever in her veins. They
lent a significance to that beautiful valley below which she was never
to forget. They made of it, for all time, a resting-place.

But she could not pause here. She kept the road along the ridge-top
until she passed the Lutheran church, and then turned down the
mountain-side again--into the dark forest again. The valley was behind
her now; but it was there. When she faltered she closed her eyes and
recalled it--the golden warmth of it and the serene promise of it.
It helped her mightily over that last mile; helped her as she dipped
down towards Big Laurel Cove--towards the dragon country. It was so
she felt--like the lost maidens of the fairy books in the creepy land
of devouring monsters. She was terrified, but under some spell she
staggered on. The strain of the four miles was beginning to tell on her
legs. And the tension was beginning to tell on her thoughts. She became
more and more a prey to the vagaries of her excited imagination. A
squirrel leaping from one bending oak branch to another made her start
and clutch at her knife--the knife which all the way had lain like a
bony hand against her white bosom.

Then the clearing before Bud’s shack and the log crossing the stream,
and beyond it--the crumpled form of Allston. She saw it from the
roadway and took the last hundred yards in a series of bounding leaps
like some frantic wild animal.




CHAPTER XXIV


At the sharp, staccato crack of Bud’s rifle Roxie had sprung from the
cabin. She was out before Allston fell. But as he fell, she fell too.
Her legs gave way and a dark cloud settled down upon her and she knew
no more.

From the rear of the spring-house Bud uttered an oath. For a second he
thought he had made some dreadful mistake; that his bullet had gone
home to her. Yet there in a heap and quite motionless lay Allston. His
automatic had dropped from his lifeless fingers and fallen several feet
away--quite out of reach. There was no shamming in that pose.

But also, prone, lay Roxie. There was no shamming in her pose either.
She had fallen face downward. Bud reloaded and ventured forth, his eyes
first on Allston and then on Roxie. But strange to say he was more
afraid to approach the latter than the former. Halfway to her side he
stood motionless with the deepest, blackest fear he had ever known
upon him. Fear had him by the throat--was strangling him with fiercer
passion than Allston had done. His arms grew limp and his rifle dropped.

He tottered forward, stopped, and went on again. Then the last ten
feet he took at a run and knelt by her side. He turned her over. She
did not resist. She was as passive as a child’s rag doll. And her face
was white--chalky white. His eyes sought her bodice near the heart.
There was no crimson stain there. That was what he had feared. He felt
her hands. They were cold, but he caught a slow pulse-beat. It was as
though he had been released from chains. She was not dead, and that was
enough.

Rising, Bud glanced at Allston. He looked at him as he might a dead
branch--with no more pity, with no more regret. The damned furriner’s
cheeks were not as pink as they had once been. He had shot true this
time.

A squirrel chattered. Bud came to alert. This was the end in one sense,
but it was only the beginning in another. This man was motionless, but
his very immobility brought a new danger. He would lie there one hour,
two hours, perhaps three hours. He would make no sound. He would not
move a finger. And yet all the while he would be calling--calling with
a voice that might be heard throughout the county. The dead are not as
helpless as they seem. Allston would be missed, in time, down at the
bungalow. Some one would wonder where he was and go to a neighbor and
make him wonder too. They would go together to a third neighbor until
the hue and cry was raised. Then they would all swarm up here together.

Bud’s wild eyes turned to the shack. He could not stay in there.
However tight he might bar the doors, the searchers would beat them
down. His home was no longer his home. He had killed more things than
one when he shot from behind the spring-house.

But at that he had not killed everything. He himself was still alive
and Roxie was still alive. And back of him lay the hills still
alive--the tangled hills that he knew as a squirrel knows them. Once
in their shelter he would still have some sort of chance. With Roxie
by his side he might have hours--even days--days that would count for
years.

Bud went back and picked up his rifle. He would need that now more
than ever. Moving swiftly and definitely, he entered the shack and
spreading a blanket on the floor hastily tossed into it the tinned
goods he had lately bought, a small bag of flour, a can of coffee, some
sugar, salt, a frying-pan, and coffee-pot. Drawing the four corners
together he tied them in a knot and throwing the bundle over his
shoulder came out.

Allston still lay on the ground quite motionless. So too did Roxie.
But there was a difference--a significant difference. As far as Bud
was concerned, Allston now stood only for the past, while Roxie still
stood for the future. Until death the future persists in full strength,
whatever limitations are put around it.

Bud stooped and placed his hands upon the girl. Her body was warm and
the touch of it magnetized him. Lifting her easily he swung her upon
his back, her head and arms over his right shoulder. So for hours he
had carried burdens heavier than she. His provisions and rifle he
seized in his left hand. With long, noiseless strides, he crossed the
log to the road, turned to the right, and began to climb the rocky
trail.

Straying tendrils of the girl’s light hair brushed his cheeks as
bending forward he bore her upwards and away--away from the silent
form in his yard, away from the valley and all its folks below, away
from the invisible hand of the law which would soon be reaching for
him. And with that loose hair against his rough cheeks, the strength
of ten men was in him. With it came a new defiance. They might turn
out the whole county after him, but before they caught him he would
be in the next county. They might turn out the whole State to hound
him, but he would cross the mountains--mountain after mountain if
necessary--until he reached the next State. There were no limits to
his horizon now. He was anchored by neither shack nor farm. They could
take them both and be damned, but they would travel far before they
took him or his woman. For all he knew, these hills and this forest
continued indefinitely. A man could live in them indefinitely. And when
they could not furnish him with what he needed, why, there were always
settlements where a man with a rifle could secure what he wished.

The higher Bud climbed, the less he had any consciousness of being a
fugitive. It was more as though all his life he had been a prisoner
and had just found freedom. His contact with civilization had done
nothing but force upon him a series of inhibitions. Some one was always
interfering with his rights. He was pulling away from all that.

Where a small stream crossed the road, he turned sharp left into the
woods. He was becoming impatient even with man-made paths. He followed
the edge of the cut made by the running water, forcing his way through
the bushes, sweeping aside the growth ahead of him with his long arm.
Not a twig touched her face. Not a branch whipped her body.

He was well out of the beaten track before any sign of consciousness
began to return to the girl. The first indication she gave was
something like a sigh and a feeble attempt to raise her head. Her eyes
even then remained closed. And she made no struggle. But at once Bud
lowered her to the leaf-strewn ground and went to the brook for water.
Scooping up as much as his cupped hands would hold he returned and
moistened her lips and bathed her forehead. The effect came quicker
than he anticipated. Her eyes opened wide and she struggled to her
elbow.

“Hit’s only me, Roxie,” he said gently.

It was only he. And as he spoke the words they were tempered with love.
Through his steel-gray eyes there shone something of the gentle blue of
the sky peering through the upper branches of the trees. It was only
he. Big and brutal and coarse-featured and merciless as he was, there
was the tenderness of a woman in his touch. Before her it was only
he--only Bud. And had there been need he would have held out his right
arm and drained into her veins every drop of his blood.

“I don’t aim ter bother yuh,” he went on as she remained dumb. “Hit’s
only me.”

Big-eyed, half fearing what she would find, Roxie was fumbling around
among her confused thoughts trying to account for her presence here.
Bud Childers--he had come to the bungalow for her. She had gone with
him. Then Allston--the night--the dawn--the crack of a rifle! Weakly
she sank back, throwing her arm over her eyes as though to shut out
some terrible sight. For a moment she almost fell back into a pit of
darkness. Allston had fallen. She had seen him fall. She had started to
his side, and then--and then--

She scrambled to her knees staring in terror at the man before her.

“Whar’s Mister Allston?” she panted.

Bud’s face grew dark.

“Over thar,” he answered grimly with a nod back of his head down the
mountain.

“You--you shot him! You--you killed him!” she cried.

“Well?” he drawled vaguely.

Still on her knees she began to crawl away from the man.

“You--you devil!” she choked.

“He come up thar and no one axed him,” he said.

“And you killed him--a-hidin’ behin’ the spring-house like a yaller
dawg, you killed a _man_!”

There was the cut of a knife in every word she spoke. He winced, but
his lips grew thin and hard. And all the blue vanished from the gray
eyes.

“’Pears like yo’re takin’ et kinder hard--him a furriner.”

As he spoke his eyes narrowed until his bushy brows almost met.

“Him a furriner,” he repeated in a voice that was like the low growl of
a mountain cat.

“Him a _man_!” burst out Roxie.

“It was him er me,” said Bud. “An’ I didn’ go atter him. He come up
hyar.”

“He come up hyar,” nodded Roxie with a quick, gasping intake of breath.
“He come up hyar. You wanter know how he come to come up hyar, Bud
Childers? It was ’cause he keered more ’bout me than he keered ’bout
hisself. Thet’s the truth, Bud Childers, ef yuh want the truth. Thet’s
the kind o’ man he was.”

“An’ you--you keered ’bout him?”

She lifted her face at that--lifted it and met Bud eye to eye:

“Keered?” she choked. “Keered? Oh, my Gawd!”

With that her head began to sink, her lips to quiver, and though she
fought hard she could no longer control the tears. Her hands before her
face she bowed low, racked by sobs that shook her to the depths.

With his rifle across his knees Bud sat down and watched her. He
removed his old black hat and ran his hand across his perspiring
forehead--slowly as though in bewilderment.




CHAPTER XXV


A man may look dead, and yet by no means be dead; a man may be very
close to the borderland of death, and yet, if he has not actually
crossed, may be dragged back by the strong hands of love. Bud
Childers’s bullet had not found Allston’s heart. The shot had gone high
and a little wild. Striking to the right of his head, it had cut a gash
across his temple--a gash which had been covered as he fell. But the
impact of the bullet against his skull had stunned him and dropped him
in his tracks. That was his good fortune, for otherwise a second shot,
better directed, would most certainly have followed.

Allston had fallen. The curtain had been rung down. For all he knew
it was final. And yet in the course of time the curtain began to rise
again. Light--the emblem of life--filtered through his eyes and made
itself a conscious fact in his half-paralyzed brain. That was all
he was aware of at first--just light; a pale, cold light like that
of dawn. It was quite meaningless and without warmth. It roused no
emotions in him; little interest. It just was; nothing more.

Yet because it was, it indicated life. It stood for continuation
instead of the end. It meant another day. It meant being. It meant--

Something more was trying to get through to that numbed brain of his.
Another sense was fluttering to life--sound. He heard a far-off noise.
Then, it seemed close to his ear. It was whispering a familiar name. It
was his name.

“Ned,” he heard. And then once more, “Ned.”

It roused him to effort. He tried to move his arm. Quickly following
this, he began to feel; something warm was resting on his forehead
smoothing back his hair. Something still warmer brushed his cold lips.
Then, like a film unfolding its secrets in a dark room, his mind began
to clear. Objects became more concrete. They stood for something. This
was a woman bending over him. Still somewhat hazy he tried to raise his
head. As he did so he heard a sharp cry. The ugly wound stood revealed.

“Ned,” came the trembling voice. “Lie still. I--I must get water.”

Then he knew. That was Wilmer Howe. That was Wilmer Howe. They were
in the cove where he had stopped to fish for trout. No, there was
something wrong about that. This was a clearing. He rose to one elbow.
His hair and cheek felt sticky, and he put up his hand. He brought it
back crimsoned. He saw the shack beyond and the whole story flashed
before him.

His head sank to the ground. He seemed to be weak. Bud had got him when
he started to run from the door. But how happened it that Wilmer had
taken the place of Roxie? This was strange--very strange. It was not
easy to think about anything very long at a time.

He heard footsteps running towards him. Again he tried to sit up, but
before he could do that Wilmer was by his side. She was holding a tin
dipper to his lips. He drank thirstily. It was very refreshing--this
clear, ice-cold spring water. She poured a little into the palm of her
hand and bathed his forehead and face. He struggled again to sit up
and, with her help, succeeded. He was facing the log shack. His hand
went back to his pocket.

“Where--where’s my gun?” he demanded.

Wilmer had thought of themselves as alone. Both Bud and Roxie had been
eliminated from her thoughts. Now she raised her eyes and glanced about.

Allston caught sight of his automatic on the ground a few feet away.
He tried to reach it and failed. Following his outstretched arm, she
saw it too, and, picking it up gingerly, handed it to him. The feel of
it in his fingers roused him to action in spite of his weakness. He
squinted towards the shack.

“Lord!” he said. “You shouldn’t be here, Wilmer. Childers may--may be
in there. He may be in the woods.”

He wanted to make his feet now. He tried and failed.

“What’s the matter with my darned legs?” he stammered petulantly.

“You’ve been hurt,” she explained gently. “Please--please to sit still.”

“But that devil--it isn’t safe for you here, I tell you.”

“You think he may be inside?”

“He might be. Where’s Roxie?”

“I--I haven’t seen any one but--but you.”

“Then--can’t you help me stand up?”

“It’s better for you not to move.”

“I’ve got to get in there and--find out.”

The girl’s face was very white and tense. She was kneeling by his side,
but she suddenly rose. Then she took the gun from his weak fingers.

“I’ll see!” she exclaimed.

Before he could catch her skirts she was moving across the few yards
of clear space to the door. He called after her. With every ounce of
strength left in him he tried to follow, but apparently he had lost a
good deal of blood. His legs were like limp straws. Helpless he saw her
disappear through the door. She was not gone long, but it seemed an
eternity before she came out again.

“The house is empty,” she said.

“Thank God. If it hadn’t been--”

“But it is. And if--can you get across there, leaning on me?”

The color was returning to his cheeks; the light to his eyes.

“Leaning on you,” he repeated slowly, “I--I think I could get anywhere.”

“Then--”

She bent down and placed an arm beneath his shoulder. As he moved she
lifted and so got him, tottering, to his feet. He stood so for a moment
with his arm over her frail shoulder. He did not seem to wish to move
farther.

“I can build a fire,” she ran on. “It’s cold out here. You can walk a
little?”

Then he said, as though to himself:

“You oughtn’t to be here.”

He tried to keep his weight from her as much as possible, but actually
he did lean heavily. Even so her shoulders did not sag. Frail they
looked--fit only for the burden of lace shawls--but they did not
sag. His left arm was over them and her right arm around his waist
supporting him. He felt the tight, steady grip of it. Even when he
paused, this did not relax.

So he came back over that threshold which so brief a time ago he had
crossed in the other direction; so he came back into that room where
he had waited through the night. There was the corner where he had sat
with Roxie. The tumbled blankets still lay on the floor. They cried out
to him. They brought her name to his lips.

“Where’s Roxie?”

“Steady,” Wilmer answered. “Steady until we get to the chair.”

She led him to a chair before the dead hearth. He slumped down wearily.

“She’s gone,” he said. “Bud must have got her.”

“She was here, then?”

“Here with Bud Childers.”

“But why--”

“Because the brute bullied her into coming. He threatened to get me--if
she didn’t come.”

“Oh!” she cried. “And then?”

“I got _him_. I had him fair--tied hand and foot. But the beggar
squirmed loose.”

“And then?”

“Roxie wouldn’t leave for fear of him.”

“Then?”

“I took a chance--this morning. He was waiting behind the spring-house.”

She shuddered at that.

“But she--she may have escaped.”

“Yes. Only--women are queer,” he answered in a voice scarcely audible.

Wilmer turned her head and smiled a little--to herself. Roxie was gone
and Bud was gone. But she was here and Ned Allston was here. And he
was helpless--helpless enough to be dependent on her. Much of her fear
had vanished. It was evident now that his wound, however painful, was
not serious. The thing to do was to make him warm and comfortable until
help arrived. That gave her an hour--perhaps two hours.

She started towards the door. His eyes were upon her.

“Where you going?” he demanded.

“I must kindle a fire.”

He staggered to his feet.

“That’s my job,” he said.

She hurried to his chair.

“You’d help most if you’d sit still,” she answered. “You only
interrupt.”

She waited until he reseated himself.

“I don’t seem to have much strength,” he muttered.

“And I have more than I ever had,” she answered. “So you see it _ought_
to be my job.”

Women are queer, Allston had said. That is a very loose and very
general statement, but there may be something in it. At any rate, it
served as an explanation, as good as any, perhaps, of why Wilmer
found the unfamiliar tasks she now went about not only congenial, but
distinctly exhilarating--even mentally stimulating. If she had ever
kindled a fire, it was so long ago she had forgotten about it. And she
would have been inclined to argue that it was so humbly simple an act
that it was not worth remembering, anyway. It made no heavy call upon
the intellect. In and of itself it was a trivial duty.

And yet, as she went to look for wood, she felt a pride in her mission
out of all proportion to the effort. She was to build a fire--for him.
She must make him warm. She must heat water and bathe his wound. If she
could find provisions in the shack, she must prepare something for him
to eat--if only a cup of tea or coffee. She must build up his strength.

_His_ strength--the strength of the man she loved. She must give him
some of her own strength and in this indirect way alone was that at
the moment possible. It was too indirect to satisfy her--too simple.
Could she have opened her veins into his veins, that would have seemed
too simple. Perhaps this new need could never be satisfied by any one
act--only by a succession of acts extending without limit through his
life. It was as big as that.

But at any rate here was something--something definite and tangible
calling for effort if only the picking up of chips. The very simplicity
of the task hallowed it. The disciples grasped eagerly at the
opportunity to express their great love through the anointing of His
feet.

In the rear of the shack Wilmer found a woodpile and a dulled and
rusty axe. Picking up this, she battered away at some of the driest
pine until she had broken it into splinters. She was surprised at the
power in her arms and back. She had never handled anything as heavy
as this axe in her life, and yet she raised it easily and brought it
down upon the stubborn dried limbs with sufficient force to accomplish
her object. They broke in spite of their resistance. There is always
satisfaction in victory even in so primitive a conflict as this. But
back of this there was more; she was doing this for her man, even as
Roxie might have done. She was using her muscles and hands for him. She
was catering to his well-being and comfort.

With cheeks grown crimson by the effort, she stopped and gathered an
armful of the splinters, hugging them close to her bosom, careless
of what they did to her gown. Clothes had become unimportant--as
unimportant as the appearance of her hands and hair. She was not
concerned with how she looked, but wholly with what she had to do. If
her long, tense walk up here had tired her, she did not feel it. She
came back through the door proudly, smiling over her load.

“Lordy!” exclaimed Allston. “But you shouldn’t be doing that. You make
me feel like a limp cad.”

She lowered her burden to the side of the hearth. Then dropping to her
knees she picked out the smaller pieces and piled them criss-cross in
the ashes, adding larger pieces on top.

Allston watched her, fascinated, in spite of his discomfort. She may
have looked at odd times more beautiful than now, but never since he
had known her. For all her beauty was of herself. Her hair, brown and
silken, was unaided by deft fingers. It was so loosely fastened that
it seemed as though at any moment it might fall over her shoulders. He
hoped and prayed that it might. He wished to see it so--all of it in
its full glory. Had he been a little nearer he would have been tempted
to touch it with his fingers.

Her fine features were quite unrestrained. They were subject to no
conscious control. And so they appeared softened to the point of
tenderness. Her face was half turned from him, but he saw an expression
about her mouth of gladness, of eager, childlike interest. Innocent as
it was, it bred wild thoughts in him. He wanted those lips nearer. He
wanted them within reach of his own lips. And yet, before he would have
leaned forward one inch towards them, he would have stopped himself
with his own automatic. The wonder of her; but the sacredness of her!

She turned with outstretched hand.

“You have a match?” she asked.

That was the most he could give her--a match. He fumbled in his pocket,
found one, and extended his own hand towards her. It was not as steady
as it should have been. It was still less steady as in taking it the
tips of her fingers touched him. There were kisses in them. He held his
breath. If only that match went out so that he could hand her another.

But she was very careful. She nursed the tiny flame until it burned
steadily and then applied it to the smaller twigs. They caught fire and
licked up to the larger twigs; sprang from those to the dry splinters
until no shadow of hope was left him. The hearth came to life like a
roused sleeper. He felt the heat at once. It was welcome.

And she held out her hands towards the dancing golden flames. She had
taken the first step towards making this room habitable; the first step
towards making it a home. She had brought into it heat and light.

With glowing face she turned towards Allston.

“A fire is such a friendly thing,” she exclaimed.

“That fire represents more than friendship,” he answered.

She did not take up the argument. She was not interested in words. She
had still a great many things to do.

She went out into Bud’s kitchen to forage. She did not discover much,
but she did find a little coffee in the bottom of a can, and sugar and
half a loaf of dry bread. That was enough. It was food and hot drink.

There was no coffee-pot, for Bud had carried that off with him, but
she found a couple of tins that were whole and clean. She brought her
treasures back and laid them at his feet.

“Here’s a bit of luck,” she said.

Every time she spoke, her words seemed curiously inadequate to Allston.
This was not a bit of luck, but stupendous good fortune. To drink
coffee of her brewing and eat bread of her finding promised a meal to
be remembered. It was an event worth all it had cost. It was going to
keep her busy near him for the next half-hour.

She made another journey to the spring-house and filled her pails.
She brought them back and placed them close to the flames near the
dog-irons. She piled on more wood and bade him see that the water did
not boil over.

“I must find some clean linen if there is any. That cut--”

He had almost forgotten about the cut. It had ceased bleeding, but it
was a matted ugly blotch on his head.

“It can wait, can’t it, until I get to the doctor?”

“No,” she replied.

Where she secured the clean white strips of cotton with which she
returned, Allston never knew. The torn hem of a ruffled petticoat left
behind in the bedroom might have told him had he ever seen it. But he
never did. He began to question her, but some instinct warned him that
this evidently was none of his business.

He did not seem to have much business of any sort here now. He found
himself a good deal under orders--gentle orders, to be sure, but
none the less to be regarded seriously. And, as he remembered, this
was one of the things he had looked forward to escaping just as soon
as he left the army. He had chafed under them;--not openly, because
he respected the necessity of them, but inwardly, because they went
against the grain. As a free-born American citizen of Southern ancestry
and independent means he had, until the war, come pretty near to doing
just about as he liked without dictation of any sort. Once he was out
of kilts no one had interfered to any extent with the management of his
everyday life.

Now this young woman, approaching him with a pail of lukewarm water,
tucked a towel around his neck and commanded him to lean his head back.
He did so when he would much have preferred not. Then she proceeded to
sop a wet rag against the wound left by Bud Childers’s bullet. It was
distinctly an unpleasant process. It hurt more or less, and the water
trickled down his neck. Besides, he felt that this was a distasteful
duty which did not come within her province, but that of a surgeon. He
offered that argument, but she kept on.

“I’m afraid I’m not much of a nurse, but I’m sure this ought to be
done,” she said.

“You’re a wonderful nurse,” he assured her.

“I’m trying not to hurt.”

“It hurts you more than it does me. It’s such a messy thing to bother
with.”

“If he had come an eighth of an inch nearer,” she trembled.

“I’m surprised he didn’t. I thought he was a better shot.”

“Oh, it was wicked of him!”

“It was more or less human. You see, he didn’t understand.”

“He’s more like a savage than a man.”

“And yet it’s so easy for any of us to misunderstand,” he said.

She was still sopping, rinsing frequently the carmine from the rag. It
was coloring the water in the pail like red pigment.

“He wanted Roxie as a beast wants his prey. But Roxie--”

“Was worth fighting for,” he broke in.

“Why did she go with him? She could have roused the house.”

“Yes,” he answered slowly. “She could have done that--and she didn’t.
Women _are_ queer.”

He had thought for a moment that he could tell this woman beside him
the whole story, but he found his lips sealed. After all this was not
his story; it was Roxie’s. It was of too sacred a nature for him to
reveal. He felt as though he had overheard something not intended for
his ears; the holy revelations a woman makes only to herself. The part
of a gentleman was to forget them; to treat them as though they had
never been. In these last few minutes he had forgotten even the girl
herself. He realized it with a start.

“Where is she?” he demanded. “If Childers took her off--”

“Even he couldn’t do that against her will,” said Wilmer. “Please to be
quiet.”

“You think that?”

“You don’t know those girls.”

“I--I guess you’re right,” he admitted.

“It’s probable she escaped into the woods. If she didn’t--”

“The woods,” he nodded. “She had the other door. She had a fair chance
if she kept her head.”

“And she knew the man through and through.”

“The devil! He gnawed through those ropes like a rat.”

The woman by his side grew pale.

“It’s a miracle you’re alive,” she said.

“I don’t know. I don’t know.”

The old familiar phrase steadied her in one way and unsteadied her in
another. It sent her thoughts back for a moment to the evening before.
He did not know--any more than he knew then. But she--how much she had
come to know in these last few hours! And yet not by the slightest
token must she let him know that she knew. She must maintain a stricter
guard over herself than ever before. She must be careful of her eyes,
her speech, her hands--especially her hands. Lightly they caressed
the cut over his temple, but only in the course of her duty. And his
tousled hair was so near her now.

A moment later, in the course of duty, she found a better opportunity.
She wound strips of white bandage around and around his head, her
fingers brushing his head--ever so gently, ever so lovingly, in the
course of duty.

And he, sitting very quiet, his eyes closed, felt them like
kisses--ashamed at the thought. He did not know. Lord! he did not know
even then--and might never know.

The coffee began to boil. She left his side and poured some of the hot
brew into a tin dipper and ordered him to drink it. After the first sip
it is doubtful if he would have drunk it except under orders. She had
sweetened it liberally but it was a muddy concoction.

She gave him bits of the stale bread and ordered him to eat them. He
obeyed--as smartly as though it were an order of the day.

Quite without resentment, too.

“Aren’t you going to join me?” he asked.

She tried a little of the coffee and made up a wry face.

“It isn’t very nice,” she admitted.

He was about to agree with that when she added quickly:

“But it’s good for you.”

So he took his medicine--to the last drop.

Up to this time she had been very busy. Now, after going out and
getting another armful of wood, there seemed to be nothing to do but
wait. He was too weak to walk and she did not dare to leave him even
long enough to go back for help to one of those neighboring houses she
had passed below.

She had to wait--facing him. That is a difficult task--when one has
a secret trembling in the eyes, on the lips, and on the tips of the
fingers.




CHAPTER XXVI


Bud had never heard a woman cry as Roxie cried. He had heard them whine
and heard them lament and seen their faces grow stolid with grief,
but that was all in the day’s work. He was always able to pass on and
forget. It was no affair of his, and women were doomed to a certain
amount of that sort of thing.

But this time the sobs got under his thick, leathery skin. They pierced
still deeper--into the core of him, into the heart of him. His eyes
upon her sagging form; upon the hair which so lately had been blown
across his cheek as he bore her away, insensible, over his shoulder;
upon the small hands crowded against her face; he felt an ache that was
like the ague. And yet there was a significant difference. The pains
of the fever were personal. They concerned him and his own body. But
now he was hurt not because of himself, but because she was hurt--this
other.

That was difficult to understand. The more so because, in reality, he
had his own grievous wound. She was crying because he had killed that
pink-cheeked furriner--crying because she had cared for the man. For a
moment that memory did serve to harden him, but--she kept on crying.
She was hurt. There was no pretense about it. She was suffering like a
wounded pet. The cause of her grief did not matter.

Bud’s heart went out to her as it never had to any other living thing.
Dropping his rifle to the ground he rose.

“Roxie,” he faltered, “don’ take on like thet.”

She did not move. She gave no indication that she heard. He took a step
nearer, his long arms hanging loosely by his side; his face troubled.

“I’m a-talkin’ to yuh, Roxie,” he said.

There was, in his voice, the deep tenderness of a lover and of a
father, too. Huddled in a heap as she was, she looked such a tiny
body. He could have picked her up without effort. And he ached to do
just that--to pick her up and hold her close. He felt that so he could
shield her from harm.

Because she did not protest, he ventured still nearer. He was at her
side now, still standing erect.

“Gawd!” he said, “Gawd, how I love yuh!”

At that Roxie sprang--upright and sideways towards Bud’s rifle. But Bud
was there before her. He moved instinctively. That gun was as much a
part of him as his right hand. He snatched it from the ground, and as
he did so the girl recoiled.

The two faced each other again; Roxie shrinking away in fear at the
revenge he might take for this attempt, Bud feeling more helpless with
the rifle in his hands than without it.

She had tried to get the gun. If she had succeeded, she would have
killed him. She hated him as fiercely as that. A woman is not often
tempted to kill, but when she is so tempted she is dangerous. And yet
the realization of this hatred, instead of rousing him to aggressive
action, instead of urging him to retaliation as ordinarily it would,
had quite the opposite effect. It took all the spirit out of him--all
his courage and high hopes. His arms grew limp. The hills about him,
instead of offering protection, hemmed him in like prison walls. No use
now in climbing them or crossing with her to the valleys beyond. With
her ready to spring upon him, whether he was there or here made little
difference. Whether he was here or anywhere made no difference now.

An overpowering sense of helplessness pressed down upon him. Never
before had he faced a situation, however desperate, where he could
not find relief in physical action. Always there was something to
break through or down; always there was a shooting chance. But here
there was nothing to strike; nothing over which a rifle bullet had any
control. He could still carry her off, to be sure, but what would he
be carrying? Just the shell of her, and this love of his was genuine
enough to turn away from that. He wanted more, but the more that he
wanted could not be taken. He could have it only as it was given. And
no man can force a gift.

Here was an idea new to Bud Childers; all that a woman has of love
worth while must come to a man as a gift. Love is not anything to be
seized with the hands. It is not the flower; it is the perfume of the
flower. It is not the hair, the lips, the hands, but the soul. Else one
woman would be like another woman and not worth the struggle.

It was quite useless for Bud to carry the girl any farther back into
the hills. He must allow her to return to her own. But after that--what
of himself?

Bud’s eyes wandered a moment--from the frightened girl to the heavy
forest growth surrounding her. The trees had always been his friends.
He had played among them as a child, hunted among them as a boy,
and lived among them as a man. They had furnished him a home, food,
protection, and companionship. But they failed him now. They offered
no encouragement. They remained as blank and as dumb as so many trees.
They turned to Roxie rather than to him. Perhaps this was in revenge
for the axe he had driven deep into the heart of so many of their
fellows.

He raised his eyes to a squirrel frolicking among the branches--a red
boomer who chattered saucily in his face. He raised his eyes to the sky
and the sky gave him no answer.

He was conscious of a deep and awful sense of desolation--as though
he had suddenly been abandoned by all creation. He wasn’t much on
religion, but there was something of religion in his feeling. Gawd
A’mighty was getting his revenge. He was alone as he had never been
alone--alone even here in his own mountain country. And his long face
grew haggard at the thought.

Bud Childers brought his eyes back to Roxie. He found her still
watching him--suspiciously, alertly. Her eyes stabbed like knives. He
could bear it no longer. With a suppressed cry, he tossed the gun to
her feet.

“Shoot ef yuh want!” he cried. “Shoot an’ hev done with hit.”

The girl picked up the rifle. She held the butt firmly against her
shoulder and covered him. And, instead of quailing, she saw him stand
a little more erect, his eyes full upon her. With her finger upon the
trigger she sighted along the barrel to the left of his broad, exposed
chest. She had only to bend that finger ever so little and Allston
stood revenged. This was no more than simple justice. She repeated that
word to herself--justice--as she raised her eyes to the gray of Bud’s
eyes. The man did not flinch. He was holding himself taut, ready to
receive the blow, but he did not flinch.

His eyes were gray, but there was blue in them. They were gray, but
there was light in them. They were gray, but back of them there was
the magic of the dawn. It was as though something was a-borning there.
Something a-borning to which her mother heart, willy-nilly, responded.
She tried to fight off the emotion, but her trigger finger weakened.
She tried still to fight it off, but her extended arms began to wobble.
She lowered the rifle.

“Bud Childers,” she said, “you knowed I couldn’ do thet. You knowed I
couldn’ kill.”

“I reckoned you’d kill me ef yuh hed the chanst,” he replied seriously.

“You’re speakin’ honest?”

“I reckoned yuh would.”

Her mind was working quickly. She did not fully believe yet that any
such change of heart had come over him. She was half ashamed to believe
it. It was not like Bud to give up in this wise. He was depending upon
her weakness. But there was one way to test him--one way that would
prove conclusively if the man meant what he said or not.

“Bud Childers,” she called, “hit ain’t fer me to hand out justice,
but thar’s them thet will. An’ ef yo’re hones’ ye’ll walk back to th’
valley an’ pay like a man fer what yuh done.”

A rifle bullet would have been merciful in comparison with those
words. Bud staggered back a little--just a very little. He recovered
quickly. Everything in his nature--everything there up to a few minutes
ago--rebelled at the suggestion. The world swam about him. And yet here
was a direct challenge--a challenge flung in his face. The eyes before
him were even now, at this hesitancy, filling with mocking laughter.
The lips were curling in scorn.

“You--you ax me to do thet?” he faltered.

“I _dare_ yuh to do thet,” she answered.

He turned on his heels and led the way back to the mountain road.

Roxie followed the tall, stooping figure as though in a dream. She was
not convinced even now that he intended to fulfill any such purpose.
Yet without faltering he led the way through the bushes and out into
the road, pausing to wait for her when his long stride took him too
far ahead. And more than once she found her own steps lagging. She was
urging this man to his death and he was going willingly. Never once did
he give any sign of weakening. She watched his big muscular body as it
swung along the road in front of her--watched it with a feeling of
awe. It was so expressive of life--so vibrant with energy. It did not
seem right to kill anything like that--even in the name of justice. Yet
Allston, too, had been vibrant with life, and then--

The memory hardened her young face. She grasped the rifle firmly and
followed more rapidly.

They were nearing the shack. It was a question of only a few more
minutes and this issue would be taken out of her hands forever. How
long it was she had been gone she did not know, but it seemed like
hours. The chances were that by now the searchers were up here. At
every turn of the winding road she half expected to see a challenging
figure. She peered ahead shrinkingly. But Bud never even glanced up. He
plodded on like one in a dream.

She paused once--deliberately. Perhaps, if he found himself out of
sight of her, he might make a dash for liberty. But his ears apparently
were alert, because within three steps he stopped in his turn and swung
to see what had become of her. So once again their eyes met.

The fool! Why didn’t he take his chance? Once around that little
bend he could have swerved into the undergrowth and disappeared.
Instead of that he just stood there waiting. His eyes asked nothing of
her--nothing of any one.

Resting the butt of the rifle on the ground, she leaned upon the barrel
as upon a staff.

“’Tain’t fer now,” he said encouragingly.

It was not far for her, but for him--it might be a journey without
end. That thing called law was helpless as long as a man kept in the
hills, but once he came down into the valley it had the strength of a
giant. She remembered stories--stories told to illustrate the might
and majesty of the law; of how certain men had struggled and run and
twisted and turned in vain in their attempt to escape the sheriff. And
her sympathies always had been with the man--as they were with the fox
against the hounds. The law was necessary and should be respected. She
had learned that at the Mission school. But the law, too, was a vague
outside force--a foreign force. More often than not it was associated
with men from the county seat or from that far-off place called
Washington.

Bud waited patiently while she stood there in a tremble. She did not
want this Thing to catch him. She did not want him dragged off and
put in prison or possibly killed. She was a valley girl, but these
mountains were part of her. It was as though she were surrendering
Caterpillar Ridge. As long as she could remember she had associated
these woods with Bud Childers. The fool! Why didn’t he run instead of
waiting for her?

“Reckon we’d better be rackin’ erlong,” he said.

So she started once more, and then, unexpectedly, they were around a
turn and in full view of the clearing before the shack. Her eyes were
drawn as by a magnet to the spot where she had last seen the crumpled
form of Allston. It was not there. Moreover, smoke was coming from the
cabin chimney. Some one was here--but not the crowd she had expected.
Not a soul was in sight.

“Wanter turn in thar?” asked Bud.

Roxie caught her breath.

“Whar _is_ he?” she trembled.

“They mought ha’ kerried him inside,” he said in a voice grown dead.

With that he went on again, across the log towards the shack. She
followed close at his heels, afraid of what she might see. Twice her
hand was almost upon Bud’s arm, but she was not sure, even at this
moment, of what she ought to do.




CHAPTER XXVII


Allston was facing the door when the two figures came out of the road.
He sprang to his feet reaching for his automatic. Wilmer was bending
over the fire.

“What is it, Ned?” she asked, without turning.

“I’m going outside a moment. Wait here,” he ordered.

Before she grasped the full meaning of his words, he was across the
threshold and in the open, his gun half-raised, his eyes full upon the
eyes of Bud Childers.

Roxie stared as at one risen from the dead. She stood transfixed. Had
it not been for the bandaged head which gave Allston his one touch of
reality, she would not have been able to breathe As it was she breathed
deeply and slowly and softly as before an apparition which might vanish
at a sound. And her hand, like a child’s, sought Bud’s hand. She
gripped it with all her might.

Then another figure appeared at the door--the figure of a woman. There
was reality enough about Wilmer Howe. After one glance she rushed out
and threw herself in front of Allston, reaching up her white arms to
his shoulders, shielding him with her body. Very gently Allston tried
to turn her one side, but with a moaning cry she clung.

“No! No! No!” she choked.

Roxie saw Allston’s half-raised arm lower and saw it sweep around this
woman.

It was then she had to hold herself steady; then that she had to face
the truth however much it hurt. She, after all, was not the Princess of
the fairy story, but this other. The book over which she had dreamed
was roughly snatched out of her hands, and the covers closed before her
eyes--the story unfinished. And yet--and yet perhaps that was the way
with fairy stories. Perhaps it was just so they were able to live on
forever. They stood for dreams--unfinished dreams. The Prince himself
was smiling. She winced at that.

Bud felt the soft fingers on his hand relaxing. It was not till then
that he removed his eyes from Allston. Suddenly this other man did not
matter. Once again he was alone with Roxie--alone with Roxie in the
hills. And the mountains roundabout him, instead of closing in, stood
back to give him room--room for his big full heart. He was breathing
the air of a free man once more. The trees were his brothers. The birds
were singing--golden notes in an air filled with sifted fine gold. And
a saucy little red squirrel chattered excitedly in a tree overhead.

Bud stooped and swept the girl into his long arms. Against her feeble
protests, he held her tight.

And lo! Roxie found another story-book open before her eyes.

       *       *       *       *       *

Whatever took place up there in that shack by Big Laurel Cove was never
satisfactorily explained either to the local gossips or the local
authorities.

As Daddie Ingram expressed it to the group which gathered at the
post-office:

“Thar’s suthin’ purty durned quar ’bout the hull bisness.”

Perhaps there was. Both Wilmer Howe and Roxie might have agreed
with him on that, and there were certain details that neither Bud
nor Allston ever fully understood. It was queer business, but as
far as those most immediately involved were concerned an eminently
satisfactory business. The wedding of Bud and Roxie which took place a
week later at the Howe bungalow seemed to be proof of this. That was a
memorable event in the neighborhood. Every one was invited and every
one came and every one appeared to be happy.

“But,” as Daddie Ingram said later, “’co’se Bud Childers is Bud
Childers an’ thar ain’ no gittin’ round thet. Roxie’ll hev to watch her
step livin’ ’long o’ him.”

Daddie was a wise old owl and his opinion carried weight. It was rather
too bad, then, that he could not have been present eight months later
when Allston and his wife climbed the mountain road to visit Bud and
Roxie. Together they took the same trail that separately each had taken
once before--along the sandy road skirting the valley and up through
the dark forest. If here where the woods smell damp Wilmer clung to
Allston’s arm, it is nobody’s business. Once through the leafy tunnel
and on the open ridge looking down upon the sunlit valley, Wilmer
paused and, placing her hands upon her husband’s shoulder, looked
straight into his blue eyes and whispered:

“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil. For Thou art with me.”

Reverently he kissed her white forehead.

So they went on into the dragon country, fearing nothing, their
hearts singing. As they approached the clearing they heard the sound
of a hammer and found Bud busy upon a substantial addition to the
cabin--a generous front porch made of planed boards. He stepped forward
cordially to greet them.

“Roxie’s in thar,” he said with a jerk of his thumb towards the
interior. “An’ she’ll shore be mighty proud ter see yuh.”

As the two approached the door he stood aside to allow them to pass. He
himself stopped a moment before a rather conspicuous doormat bearing
the word “Welcome.” Rather sheepishly he lagged behind to wipe his
heavy boots clean of all dirt.

“Roxie’s kinder fussy ’bout mud,” he explained.
